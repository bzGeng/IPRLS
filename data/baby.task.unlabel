My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie. My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep. I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile. I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases. But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it. So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth 
I completely understand your concern. Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off. They are not built for anyone to play with them. My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch. This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it. I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme. For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile: Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out. The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying. I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib. This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit 
My daughter loves this toy! All the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break, too : 
Being a fan of the Baby Einstein line of products, I put this on my registry. What a great gift it turned out to be. It could entertain my daughter when nothing else did! She is now 16 months old and too big for it, but when she started watching the Baby Einstein videos, she recognized the characters that were on this center 
I purchased the Baby Einstein Discover and Play center to keep at the office for days my then-5-mnth-old son, Toby, was with me at work. He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities. Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined. I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles. I can't say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons, but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months, when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short-lived. 
We loved this because we could play with our daughter (the puppet was fun for us too) but it also kept her busy long enough to cook a meal or read the paper! She liked being upright, and the height adjustments were great for our tall baby...also, it only has ONE battery operated toy so your child is given the opportunity to interact with the toys rather than watch a bunch of flashing lights and music. Saving this for the next child 
I have 2 activity centers by different makers (the other is at Grandmas house)so I have something to compare this to. I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15-20 dollars you might have to spend. To begin,the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next. That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer,it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver. The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by. I can't say enough positive things about this Activity Center. I highly recommend it as it is both stimulating and entertaining for baby. 
We got one of those "hang in the doorway" jumpers but we don't really have an good place to hang it so we exchanged it for this. My baby really has a good time in it, laughing and jumping all over the place! Recommende 
We waited until our daughter was [...] to get her this, and it's fantastic! She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...] I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it. (It was a poop-eroo for us too.) A few things that I learned using this though is: The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it. It is incredibly hard to clean. The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside. My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it. I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet 
I bought this for my first baby (now 2 1/2). He didn't like to spend much time in the Jumperoo and would only last a couple of minutes. I recently pulled it out and tried my 5 month in it. She was a bit fussy at first but now absolutely loves this. She jumps up and down for an hour, laughing and playing with the toys on the front. Any toy that can keep a 5 month old amused for more than a few minutes is wonderful and so I would definitely recommend it. I would have given it 5 stars but feel the gadgets on the front could be better 
Our baby can spend a good portion of his day jumping in this thing. Even if he isn't jumping he loves to hit the noise buttons and various toy items around the seating area. Sometimes he just isn't in the mood and will cry and jump but most of the time he is delighted and will wear himself out 
I bought this for my son when he was just shy of 4 months old. Initially, he would just sit in the seat, occassionally moving sideways (probably because he lost his balance). After 5-10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button (he'd had enough). That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he'd grow to enjoy it. On the 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like a crazed kangaroo! His face had a wide smile and some drool, he was excited! From that point forward (and still going) he's consistently loved his time in the J-roo. He regularly has jumping sessions of 30-45 minutes while watching Clifford, Dragon Tales, ... This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs. Also, it's not a bad break for us parents now and again 
Our little one LOVED this toy until he turned 8 months. Now its really a challenge to try to get him into this thing or the Baby Einstein stationary entertainer (see my review for that). However, he will still play with it standing OUTSIDE and loves touching the legs and toys and chewing on the bar. Unfortunately he puts up a fight when we try to get him in it. But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it. He would bounce back and forth and say "AHHHHHHH!" and just laugh really hard. So glad that someone gave this to us and we didn't have to buy it. But if you are making that decision, I say it is totally worth it. 
How much fun! It has a salsa beat, sung by children and is an old favorite song 
This set is great! my 9 month-old son has loved lavander scent since almost birth. The bottles are big, you won't need more baby bath in a year or so. The CD is lot of fun! my son really enjoys to bounce while listening to his favorite tracks. The toy is soft and purple ... a real baby eyed-catching. We use the case to store baby medicines, tylenol and stuff. Buy it now, you won't regret 
I got it as a gift for my upcoming baby, I love this item. It has a lot of products and they all smell soooooo good, I can't wait to use it on my baby and see if she'll like them as much as I do. I also like the container to hold on my baby bath items 
I love this bathwash. After a bath my son smells sooo fresh and it's gentle on him. It's gentle on his skin and cleans him nicely. My son sweats so much and I have to bathe him a lot. I was really worried that bathing him so much would make his skin dried out but the bath wash and shampoo combo keeps his skin nice and soft and smelling so nice. It was a good buy! 
The gift item is great and was on the mother's wish list. I spent what I could afford and then ended up with a more expensive item due to the amount of shipping, which increased it from about $30 to about $40. That hurt 
I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't. It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any! I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom. The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests. The vapor bath is fantastic. We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion! I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice. We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be 
I registered for this item and couldn't be happier with it. The case is perfect to keep everything organized and at hand. The products work great, though I haven't tried any others, so nothing to compare them to. I especially love the cd though. I would definately reccomend this set to anybody looking for the first bathing kit for their little one 
I sent this as a baby shower gift and it was used right away. The new parent's loved it and praised the great smell 
THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER, IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU. I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE. MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME. I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL. THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE. VERY SENSITIVE, I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE (I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP). IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME (I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC). I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE. THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE. TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN. THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT, I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WET!!!!!!, BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON'T HURT IT 
I've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor. We have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference. I've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception. I think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it 
My husband and I adore this monitor. It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great. We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away. The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up. I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house. I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long! You can defintely trust this monitor 
This is one of our favorite, most used baby shower gifts. It was so simple to set up and we LOVE that you can carry the parents' monitor arround. It's also nice that you can turn it to "voice activated" so you only hear cries and not background noise. This is a must if you don't want to stand right next to the crib to monitor sleeping baby 
I love the Pre-Natal and Newborn Baby Education System. It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby's development even before he is born. The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two-year-old. We have really enjoyed the CDs. I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period. 
This sort of product wasn't available with my first child. It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear, and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going. When I found this Bundleme product, I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child. It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat/carrier. I don't have to worry about dressing him up, I just put a hat on him and off we go!! It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine. So far we have endured 40 degree temps, rain, wind and snow and he's stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time!! Truly an excellent purchase! 
My son was born in February and I actually considered taking this product back because I didn't think it would be usueful. After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong. I {{LOVE}} this product. It fit perfectly in my infant carrier. Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier. With the Bundle Me I didn't have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold. An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn't need to worry about him overheating. I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back. It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again. I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful. Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great. I already consider it well worth the money 
This was great for the first three months. We had a winter baby and this was great for the cold weather, unlike a blanket, it will not fall off. After about three months, the baby will start to outgrow as their feet will begin to hit the edge. Since it zippers and the bottom and top separate, this would also be good for additional cozy lining for any young baby. Good buy! 
Our daughter was born in October so we used the bundle me all the time. It was so easy to just buckle her up and go instead of bundling her up in sweaters and jackets. As she got older however she would push the top flap away but I wasn't that worried because it wasn't that cold by March (she was still quite warm). You might want to think about this if you have an active baby. 
With my second baby due in Feb - I knew I would need something to keep her warm. I purchased this product and LOVE IT! The color is beautiful, it is snuggly, warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it. As she is only 4 weeks old, it can be a little big (how to explain?)... it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down. But it is a great product and I'm sooo glad we got it 
We live in the cold, rainy Northwest part of the country. This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December. It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital. We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat. He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me. This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby. It is a must for Winter babies. It is well worth the money 
Wow! This is the best thing I received for my baby. It has saved me sooo much time. I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this. I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit. We just never use them. I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller. She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy. When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller. It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination. She never felt the cold! It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats. 
This is a great pack'n'play. It's easy to set-up and take any place. The bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that I have. The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby's attention. My only problem is the piece for the top. Whenever I try to use it, the arms bow in and it doesn't look very sturdy. I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground. It just doesn't seem very sturdy and I have tried everything. Other than that, I am glad that I bought this! 
My little girl loves this play space! The colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that I can get dinner on or help with home work. The only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes. 
I think for your money you get a great value for this playard. It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this. It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with. The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others. It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops. The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars 
I just recently got this pack n play as a shower gift from the godmother of our little one. This pack n play has a great vibe to it... the colors are absolutely fantastic. It's easy to set up and has the most adorable toys. It is also easy to convert it into the gym. The only complaint I have is that I'm 32 weeks and I had a heck of a time putting everything into the bag by myself. 
I just bought this at babiesRus store. Easy to setup. My baby loves the bright colors and music. I highly recommend this to anyone 
Very colorful and easy to set up. A quilted fitted playard sheet to cover the mattress makes this a great place for baby to nap! Cute toys. Folds and unfolds very easily. Very sturdy 
Bored with all those "stage" in life books for your baby to be? Perhaps you are (as I am) soon to be expecting and realize that you won't have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may/may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives. Well then this book is for you! I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it (yes all 500 pages) on Saturday. What a delight. The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor. Be warned though, if you are looking for the "What to expect book" format this is not for you. This is a realistic, warm, and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way. If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up. Its like talking to an old friend that you haven't met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby 
I purchased this book for a young friend of mine who was about to have a baby and had lots of questions about not only the baby, but about what her body was going through. She loves it and refers to it constantly 
This book provides an exceptionally thorough look at baby's first year from both the mother and baby's perspective. First-time mothers often express frustration about how ill-prepared they felt for the early weeks and months of motherhood. This book does an excellent job of giving mothers-to-be a realistic idea of what life after baby will really be like, for better and for worse. It's a truly one-of-a-kind and top-notch reference 
This is a great, easy-to-read book with good info. However, the title is a bit misleading--2/3 of the book deal with planning for baby and dealing with the first few days. It is an excellent book, but it is more a book to read in your last trimester than after baby is born 
If you are about to have a baby (or babies, in the case of parents of twins or other multiples), this book can really help you to get off to a good start with your babies. It has a lot of helpful tips and advice. Also, you don't have to try to guess where the information you're seeking is because the book is organized by chapters that are on that particular topic, like a chapter on sleep, a chapter on breastfeeding, and so on. The problem with some of the month-by-month baby books is that the information you need is sometimes in the wrong month 
I have found this book to be a very helpful reference guide. There is a chart that summarize first year developmental milestones, a chapter that includes detailed information about the signs, symptoms, and treatments for the most common illnesses that babies tend to develop, advice on getting breastfeeding off to the best start, helpful advice on what to expect in terms of newborn behavior (sleep, crying, feeding patterns, etc.) The author's tone is friendly and reassuring. If you enjoyed the previous book in this series (The Mother of All Pregnancy Books), as I did, you will likely enjoy this book, too 
Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product. From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby. She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open. Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds. Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch. She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little "lay lay lay" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's. Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst. Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation! At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals. She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition. Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, "if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it". We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours. We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.  
ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course. Each baby is exceptional, in their own way. But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators? Well, I know one - MINE! I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant. One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm. It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid. I was about 7 months pregnant then. Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is. He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet. He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks. He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.). Yesterday he started reaching for objects. Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age. He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks. So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it. I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children. I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny 
I was lucky enough to happen onto the Baby Plus..ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? That's what I hear from people. If I want I can sleep in, and I have been able to since my daughter was 2 months old. I can take a nap.She hardly cried and when she did it was a pure purpose cry, food. I saw my daughters eyes alert and amazing from the moment she was put in my arms. She has exceeded where she "should" be at this point in her life, 22months. Our bonding from the minute I put on the Baby Plus till now..awesome.Every heartbeat brought a reaction. I can't believe this is my daughter and neither can my parents:) Was I ever this good? No! My husband's family is the same. How could we have such a beautiful, smart and calm 22 month old? LUCKY?? Nope, Baby Plus! Sure she's a 22month old at times but she's smart as a whip and I will use Baby Plus again! Thank you for discovering and making this product! I will love my child no matter what but I LOVE the addition this has brought to my daughter. 22 months and I am soo lucky! THANK YOU!! 
I began using the system when I was 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up the schedule with a fast pace career. I stopped when I was about 31 weeks. I thought that my efforts went down the drain and did not try to look for any benefits from Baby Plus. However, when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have. I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son's development. He never had colic, has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born, laughs as if it's rolling from his toes since he was 4 months, latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words, not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he's memorized for his favorites songs. I highly recommend this product 
The baby calmly swings everyday. The baby especially enjoys looking up at the characters and mirror which keeps him entertained while swinging. It has an adjustable seat that has allowed the baby to swing comfortably since he was brought home from the hospital. I believe this was the best investment thus far for our infant 
I have five kids, ages 11 and under, so we have seen and had many, many baby items. This has to be one of my favorites of all time! We just love it! Baby Ian is six weeks now, and sleeps in it for his naps, swings in it when he's fussy, and watches the mobile when I make dinner. I honestly don't know how we lived without it. Buy it now! And buy it here, it's $20 cheaper than babies'r'us 
This item is the greatest thing since disposable diapers! My grandson LOVES his, in fact; they moved it into the bedroom and the bassenette went in the family room because he sleeps so much better in the Papasan chair. It is wonderful, you owe it to yourself to get this not only for the baby's sake but for yours! 
We bought this swing just under a year ago, when our baby was about two months old. She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it, or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us. Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile, so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son. They used it only two months, when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment. The batteries were intact, but the swing didn't work whatsoever anymore, even with new batteries. I called Fisher Price, and they were very concerned about the smoke. I didn't have the purchase receipt anymore, and wasn't sure if it was still covered by the warranty. They asked for the Product Code and Run Code, and where I bought it (Babies R Us). They are now sending me a brand new motor housing (the entire top portion of the swing, which you just attach the legs to). They are also sending a pre-paid label to put on the box, so I can send them the dead motor housing. How great is that! I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price's customer service. No receipt, and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing. Talk about gaining customer loyalty! It's good to know you can pay $130 for a baby item and get your money's worth all around. The swing itself is just wonderful. The motor is quiet, my baby loved the moving bugs, and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby. The swing's colors are great as well, soothing and neutral, instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings 
This was the best shower gift we received. We had this set up in our living room before we went to the hospital. We used this swing from day one, every day. Our baby just turned seven months old and he still loves to swing in it. I honestly don't know where we would be without this swing. We literally use it every day. 
WOW!! This swing has been a life saver. My son LOVES his swing! It's proven to be the best baby shower present ever. I highly recommend this swing. Your baby is happy, content and falls asleep easy giving mom time to get things done!!! Love love love it 
It is a good buy, only my daughter doesn't like the swinging motion and rather enjoys looking at the mobile.. 
I bought this without reading the reviews. The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable. Because it leaked I bought a different tub. In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring. I feel much better knowing the baby isn't going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub. What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it. It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by. Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub. Hope this helps 
This is by far the best bathtub we ever used with our three boys. Yes, it does leak if you don't read the directions and set it up properly - I got one of those leaky surprises too. Then I went back to the setup directions and found the problem and fixed it. My youngest has loved bathtime ever since. I especially liked how it converts to a bath seat, as I hated the one I used to use with my other kids. I'm only sorry my "baby" is about to outgrow it! This has been the easiest bathtub I've ever used, especially with a slippery newborn. Okay, so it's not the most intuitive as far as setting up - you WILL have to ready the accompanying directions! - but once you set it up, you'll be glad you made the effort. A great product 
Not sure why this got bad reviews. There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak. But once we figured that out we had no problems. We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem. Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe. Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value

I received this at my shower and it is really nice. It is an attractive way to store misc baby items. Right now I am using it for diapering needs. Great price also 
We recently purchased this for our son's changing table in his room and are very pleased with it. It has pockets on the inside for small items such as comb, nail clippers, etc. And the inside is plenty big for a box of wipes. A cute addition to the nursery 
We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much. But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue. However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper. (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!) The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me. We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part. I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed. (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.) The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon. (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!) We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle. 
I got this for a baby gift and filled it with bath items. I thought it looked great and would be useful to use 
I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. This bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as I bought it the price reduced on Amazon. This had been a constant problem on Amazon and I think somebody should do something about it. I think I should get a refund :-).. Thanks, Shobhn 
I have used this baby tub since my daughters belly button fell off. The net is very easy to use and it is very easy while washing the baby. I only quit using the net when my daughter started to roll. Now se sits up and has plenty of room to splash. I also like the elevated seat so that way she is not slipping and sliding all over the tub. My daughter also loves the toys that come with it 
I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!! She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her. She really enjoys bathtime. And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby... you will really enjoy it. I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her. After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place. Caution: Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size. This tub is perfect if you do that! The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use. Please read the directions. Both you and your child will appreciate that you did 
I love this chair and so does my 5 month old. I love that it reclines 3 different postions and the best feature is it slides up and down to meet my level needs. Feeding him from any height is easy 
I love this high chair and so does my daughter.It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food.The chair also folds compactly for storage.It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels.It has a height adjustment that is great.I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner.It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older.I love the chair pad, the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean.Which is great for moms since we hate a mess.It is very sturdy and safe.I also like the five point harness system.My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe.I highly recommend this product to new and old moms.I love it!!!!!!!!! 
This is a nice chair, except for the brakes. They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot, they lock. It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock. Since we are constantly moving the chair to us, or back to the wall, etc., this is a real problem because you have to unlock them (esp. if more than one of the four is locked) in order to move the chair easily. As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler, this is even harder. The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of. If it weren't for the brakes, I would give it 5 stars. The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water, easier for little ones to push 
We bought this highchair for our 7 month old daughter last weekend. She absolutely loves it. Love the piece in the middle of the seat that prevents baby from sliding down. The safety straps are extremely easy to use clean up is a snap. Our daughter loves the toys it comes with is thrilled to be sitting at the table with the rest of the family. Would definitely recommend this highchair 
Our son loves the toy. The buttons were hard for him to push initially. But at 10 months he was able to push the buttons to make the sounds. He loves it both on and off the chair. Our only complaint is the wheel locks lock too easily. They flip down with barely a touch, which can be annoying when you want to wheel the chair around alot, like we do in a small kitchen. 
My twins love these blocks. They received them as a gift at about 3 months old. At first they enjoyed just touching them, each side of the blocks have a different texture. Now that they are older (7 months) these blocks are one of their favortite toys. They can easily hold them, shake them and throw them 
My son loves these blocks! We introduced them to him around 3 months. He loves the colors, and is now starting to "pet" the different textures on the cubes! These are great toys even for teething. My son loves to chew on the little bumbs. His favorite cube would have to be the duck. He talks and squeals everytime the duck quacks. These cubes will also come in handy later when he is learning his colors and letters. We love Baby Einstein 
I bought these blocks when my son was a month old, he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them. The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby's eye. When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby's touch and they also have a unique feature too. Red and Blue are rattles, Yellow's duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green's frog vibrates when you pull his leg. These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a $10 value, they will keep your baby entertained and happy 
great attractive colors to the baby... but quite too big (and frustrating) a 5-6 month-old who's just starting to learn to grasp with one hand and just learning to navigate his opposable hands. 
These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy. Each has different textures, images, and something unique about it. -The yellow block has a duck on the one side that "quacks" when pressed. On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror. Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif. -The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another. -The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake. It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif. -The blue block is another rattle. It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another. -All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English). The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding). My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying "soft", "smooth", or "bumpy" and she loves the feelings. My friend's daughter, who is five months, loves to pick up and throw down the blocks. It's one of her favorite games. I'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant 
My som is 10 months old and loves these blocks. Some make noises. The yellow has a picture of a duck on it and makes a quacking sound. The green one has a picture of a frog and you pull the tail and it vibrates and my son loves that. There are also different textures on each block and my son really likes playing with them 
I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old. At first, he seemed a little intimidated by the toys, and would cry when I put him in it. Once he got used to it, he really enjoyed it. Now he plays with all the toys, and he likes that it wobbles around. His favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads. I did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about. Just lucky I guess. The seat is really hard to remove for washing, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 
Being a fan of the Baby Einstein line of products, I put this on my registry. What a great gift it turned out to be. It could entertain my daughter when nothing else did! She is now 16 months old and too big for it, but when she started watching the Baby Einstein videos, she recognized the characters that were on this center 
I purchased the Baby Einstein Discover and Play center to keep at the office for days my then-5-mnth-old son, Toby, was with me at work. He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities. Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined. I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles. I can't say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons, but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months, when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short-lived. 
We loved this because we could play with our daughter (the puppet was fun for us too) but it also kept her busy long enough to cook a meal or read the paper! She liked being upright, and the height adjustments were great for our tall baby...also, it only has ONE battery operated toy so your child is given the opportunity to interact with the toys rather than watch a bunch of flashing lights and music. Saving this for the next child 
I have 2 activity centers by different makers (the other is at Grandmas house)so I have something to compare this to. I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15-20 dollars you might have to spend. To begin,the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next. That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer,it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver. The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by. I can't say enough positive things about this Activity Center. I highly recommend it as it is both stimulating and entertaining for baby. 
We got one of those "hang in the doorway" jumpers but we don't really have an good place to hang it so we exchanged it for this. My baby really has a good time in it, laughing and jumping all over the place! Recommende 
I bought this for my first baby (now 2 1/2). He didn't like to spend much time in the Jumperoo and would only last a couple of minutes. I recently pulled it out and tried my 5 month in it. She was a bit fussy at first but now absolutely loves this. She jumps up and down for an hour, laughing and playing with the toys on the front. Any toy that can keep a 5 month old amused for more than a few minutes is wonderful and so I would definitely recommend it. I would have given it 5 stars but feel the gadgets on the front could be better 
I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper. It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed. I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame. They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise. Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies. The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious. There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though 
Our baby can spend a good portion of his day jumping in this thing. Even if he isn't jumping he loves to hit the noise buttons and various toy items around the seating area. Sometimes he just isn't in the mood and will cry and jump but most of the time he is delighted and will wear himself out 
I bought this for my son when he was just shy of 4 months old. Initially, he would just sit in the seat, occassionally moving sideways (probably because he lost his balance). After 5-10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button (he'd had enough). That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he'd grow to enjoy it. On the 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like a crazed kangaroo! His face had a wide smile and some drool, he was excited! From that point forward (and still going) he's consistently loved his time in the J-roo. He regularly has jumping sessions of 30-45 minutes while watching Clifford, Dragon Tales, ... This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs. Also, it's not a bad break for us parents now and again 
Our little one LOVED this toy until he turned 8 months. Now its really a challenge to try to get him into this thing or the Baby Einstein stationary entertainer (see my review for that). However, he will still play with it standing OUTSIDE and loves touching the legs and toys and chewing on the bar. Unfortunately he puts up a fight when we try to get him in it. But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it. He would bounce back and forth and say "AHHHHHHH!" and just laugh really hard. So glad that someone gave this to us and we didn't have to buy it. But if you are making that decision, I say it is totally worth it. 
How much fun! It has a salsa beat, sung by children and is an old favorite song 
This set is great! my 9 month-old son has loved lavander scent since almost birth. The bottles are big, you won't need more baby bath in a year or so. The CD is lot of fun! my son really enjoys to bounce while listening to his favorite tracks. The toy is soft and purple ... a real baby eyed-catching. We use the case to store baby medicines, tylenol and stuff. Buy it now, you won't regret 
I got it as a gift for my upcoming baby, I love this item. It has a lot of products and they all smell soooooo good, I can't wait to use it on my baby and see if she'll like them as much as I do. I also like the container to hold on my baby bath items 
I love this bathwash. After a bath my son smells sooo fresh and it's gentle on him. It's gentle on his skin and cleans him nicely. My son sweats so much and I have to bathe him a lot. I was really worried that bathing him so much would make his skin dried out but the bath wash and shampoo combo keeps his skin nice and soft and smelling so nice. It was a good buy! 
I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower. The products lather up really well and they smell great! They are gentle and they don't make my daughter get a rash. You get a lot of product for the price too. My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold. Now that my daughter is teething, she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin. The moisturizing stick works great for this. We love this gift set and would recommend it. 
The gift item is great and was on the mother's wish list. I spent what I could afford and then ended up with a more expensive item due to the amount of shipping, which increased it from about $30 to about $40. That hurt 
I registered for this item and couldn't be happier with it. The case is perfect to keep everything organized and at hand. The products work great, though I haven't tried any others, so nothing to compare them to. I especially love the cd though. I would definately reccomend this set to anybody looking for the first bathing kit for their little one 
I sent this as a baby shower gift and it was used right away. The new parent's loved it and praised the great smell 
This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it. We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability. I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall. I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great. When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive! I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something 
This is one of our favorite, most used baby shower gifts. It was so simple to set up and we LOVE that you can carry the parents' monitor arround. It's also nice that you can turn it to "voice activated" so you only hear cries and not background noise. This is a must if you don't want to stand right next to the crib to monitor sleeping baby 
In terms of pre-natal resources, this is the best I have found! The positive results are proven. I can not think of a reason not to buy this product. Every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child. This system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born. You will even notice a response from your baby! It's very exciting 
I love the Pre-Natal and Newborn Baby Education System. It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby's development even before he is born. The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two-year-old. We have really enjoyed the CDs. I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period. 
My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie. My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep. I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile. I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases. But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it. So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth 
I completely understand your concern. Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off. They are not built for anyone to play with them. My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch. This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it. I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme. For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile: Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out. The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying. I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib. This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit 
I purchased this item (not from Amazon) and my child loved it! The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great, not the usual 'kid-drivel' that usually is part of any kid item. Some HBB's come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon. Highly recommended 
This sort of product wasn't available with my first child. It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear, and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going. When I found this Bundleme product, I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child. It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat/carrier. I don't have to worry about dressing him up, I just put a hat on him and off we go!! It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine. So far we have endured 40 degree temps, rain, wind and snow and he's stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time!! Truly an excellent purchase! 
I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc 
My son was born in February and I actually considered taking this product back because I didn't think it would be usueful. After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong. I {{LOVE}} this product. It fit perfectly in my infant carrier. Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier. With the Bundle Me I didn't have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold. An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn't need to worry about him overheating. I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back. It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again. I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful. Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great. I already consider it well worth the money 
This was great for the first three months. We had a winter baby and this was great for the cold weather, unlike a blanket, it will not fall off. After about three months, the baby will start to outgrow as their feet will begin to hit the edge. Since it zippers and the bottom and top separate, this would also be good for additional cozy lining for any young baby. Good buy! 
Our daughter was born in October so we used the bundle me all the time. It was so easy to just buckle her up and go instead of bundling her up in sweaters and jackets. As she got older however she would push the top flap away but I wasn't that worried because it wasn't that cold by March (she was still quite warm). You might want to think about this if you have an active baby. 
WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT. IT REALLY KEEPS THE BABY WARM EVEN IN THE COLDEST WINTER. WHEN THE WIND IS WHIPPING, THE GENEROUS FRONT FLAP FLIPS UP OVER THE CARRYING ARM OF THE BABY SEAT AND ALSO KEEPS THE BABY WARM. NO FUSSY COATS AND HUNDREDS OF BLANKETS. I HOPE TO USE IT NEXT WINTER ALSO 
With my second baby due in Feb - I knew I would need something to keep her warm. I purchased this product and LOVE IT! The color is beautiful, it is snuggly, warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it. As she is only 4 weeks old, it can be a little big (how to explain?)... it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down. But it is a great product and I'm sooo glad we got it 
I just recently got this pack n play as a shower gift from the godmother of our little one. This pack n play has a great vibe to it... the colors are absolutely fantastic. It's easy to set up and has the most adorable toys. It is also easy to convert it into the gym. The only complaint I have is that I'm 32 weeks and I had a heck of a time putting everything into the bag by myself. 
I just bought this at babiesRus store. Easy to setup. My baby loves the bright colors and music. I highly recommend this to anyone 
Very colorful and easy to set up. A quilted fitted playard sheet to cover the mattress makes this a great place for baby to nap! Cute toys. Folds and unfolds very easily. Very sturdy 
I got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it! This playpen is so wonderful, very colorful sooo easy to set it up. I'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it. I received great reviews on this gear also so don't be dissapointed to grab one like it!!! awesome playpen!! 
I received this pack n' play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up. It is very colorful and the the toys are cute. It was very easy to set-up. I am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total. The matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead. It is very multi-functional 
Bored with all those "stage" in life books for your baby to be? Perhaps you are (as I am) soon to be expecting and realize that you won't have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may/may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives. Well then this book is for you! I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it (yes all 500 pages) on Saturday. What a delight. The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor. Be warned though, if you are looking for the "What to expect book" format this is not for you. This is a realistic, warm, and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way. If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up. Its like talking to an old friend that you haven't met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby 
I purchased this book for a young friend of mine who was about to have a baby and had lots of questions about not only the baby, but about what her body was going through. She loves it and refers to it constantly 
This book provides an exceptionally thorough look at baby's first year from both the mother and baby's perspective. First-time mothers often express frustration about how ill-prepared they felt for the early weeks and months of motherhood. This book does an excellent job of giving mothers-to-be a realistic idea of what life after baby will really be like, for better and for worse. It's a truly one-of-a-kind and top-notch reference 
This is a great, easy-to-read book with good info. However, the title is a bit misleading--2/3 of the book deal with planning for baby and dealing with the first few days. It is an excellent book, but it is more a book to read in your last trimester than after baby is born 
If you are about to have a baby (or babies, in the case of parents of twins or other multiples), this book can really help you to get off to a good start with your babies. It has a lot of helpful tips and advice. Also, you don't have to try to guess where the information you're seeking is because the book is organized by chapters that are on that particular topic, like a chapter on sleep, a chapter on breastfeeding, and so on. The problem with some of the month-by-month baby books is that the information you need is sometimes in the wrong month 
A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read. 
I have found this book to be a very helpful reference guide. There is a chart that summarize first year developmental milestones, a chapter that includes detailed information about the signs, symptoms, and treatments for the most common illnesses that babies tend to develop, advice on getting breastfeeding off to the best start, helpful advice on what to expect in terms of newborn behavior (sleep, crying, feeding patterns, etc.) The author's tone is friendly and reassuring. If you enjoyed the previous book in this series (The Mother of All Pregnancy Books), as I did, you will likely enjoy this book, too 
I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times. This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly. Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks. The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky. My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around. By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's. By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters. I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3. Do I credit the Baby Plus? Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby #2. 
I was lucky enough to happen onto the Baby Plus..ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? That's what I hear from people. If I want I can sleep in, and I have been able to since my daughter was 2 months old. I can take a nap.She hardly cried and when she did it was a pure purpose cry, food. I saw my daughters eyes alert and amazing from the moment she was put in my arms. She has exceeded where she "should" be at this point in her life, 22months. Our bonding from the minute I put on the Baby Plus till now..awesome.Every heartbeat brought a reaction. I can't believe this is my daughter and neither can my parents:) Was I ever this good? No! My husband's family is the same. How could we have such a beautiful, smart and calm 22 month old? LUCKY?? Nope, Baby Plus! Sure she's a 22month old at times but she's smart as a whip and I will use Baby Plus again! Thank you for discovering and making this product! I will love my child no matter what but I LOVE the addition this has brought to my daughter. 22 months and I am soo lucky! THANK YOU!! 
I began using the system when I was 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up the schedule with a fast pace career. I stopped when I was about 31 weeks. I thought that my efforts went down the drain and did not try to look for any benefits from Baby Plus. However, when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have. I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son's development. He never had colic, has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born, laughs as if it's rolling from his toes since he was 4 months, latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words, not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he's memorized for his favorites songs. I highly recommend this product 
A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system. I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20. I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system. I feel like I am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way. While using BabyPlus, the battery cover clips snapped off. I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover, no questions asked. BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby, rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts 
I am using the babyplus system for the second time and am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old. Faith was born alert, calm, and hardly cried at all as an infant. She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat. She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write, sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts. Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble. Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination with activities and sports. I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system. I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again. Do not be afraid to try something new. Just read the studies and reviews, they speak for themselves. You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child. 
The baby calmly swings everyday. The baby especially enjoys looking up at the characters and mirror which keeps him entertained while swinging. It has an adjustable seat that has allowed the baby to swing comfortably since he was brought home from the hospital. I believe this was the best investment thus far for our infant 
I have five kids, ages 11 and under, so we have seen and had many, many baby items. This has to be one of my favorites of all time! We just love it! Baby Ian is six weeks now, and sleeps in it for his naps, swings in it when he's fussy, and watches the mobile when I make dinner. I honestly don't know how we lived without it. Buy it now! And buy it here, it's $20 cheaper than babies'r'us 
This item is the greatest thing since disposable diapers! My grandson LOVES his, in fact; they moved it into the bedroom and the bassenette went in the family room because he sleeps so much better in the Papasan chair. It is wonderful, you owe it to yourself to get this not only for the baby's sake but for yours! 
We bought this swing just under a year ago, when our baby was about two months old. She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it, or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us. Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile, so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son. They used it only two months, when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment. The batteries were intact, but the swing didn't work whatsoever anymore, even with new batteries. I called Fisher Price, and they were very concerned about the smoke. I didn't have the purchase receipt anymore, and wasn't sure if it was still covered by the warranty. They asked for the Product Code and Run Code, and where I bought it (Babies R Us). They are now sending me a brand new motor housing (the entire top portion of the swing, which you just attach the legs to). They are also sending a pre-paid label to put on the box, so I can send them the dead motor housing. How great is that! I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price's customer service. No receipt, and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing. Talk about gaining customer loyalty! It's good to know you can pay $130 for a baby item and get your money's worth all around. The swing itself is just wonderful. The motor is quiet, my baby loved the moving bugs, and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby. The swing's colors are great as well, soothing and neutral, instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings 
This was the best shower gift we received. We had this set up in our living room before we went to the hospital. We used this swing from day one, every day. Our baby just turned seven months old and he still loves to swing in it. I honestly don't know where we would be without this swing. We literally use it every day. 
WOW!! This swing has been a life saver. My son LOVES his swing! It's proven to be the best baby shower present ever. I highly recommend this swing. Your baby is happy, content and falls asleep easy giving mom time to get things done!!! Love love love it 
I bought this without reading the reviews. The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable. Because it leaked I bought a different tub. In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring. I feel much better knowing the baby isn't going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub. What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it. It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by. Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub. Hope this helps 
This is by far the best bathtub we ever used with our three boys. Yes, it does leak if you don't read the directions and set it up properly - I got one of those leaky surprises too. Then I went back to the setup directions and found the problem and fixed it. My youngest has loved bathtime ever since. I especially liked how it converts to a bath seat, as I hated the one I used to use with my other kids. I'm only sorry my "baby" is about to outgrow it! This has been the easiest bathtub I've ever used, especially with a slippery newborn. Okay, so it's not the most intuitive as far as setting up - you WILL have to ready the accompanying directions! - but once you set it up, you'll be glad you made the effort. A great product 
Not sure why this got bad reviews. There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak. But once we figured that out we had no problems. We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem. Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe. Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value 
Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it! It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys. The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub. Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub

I purchases this basket for a friend. I was very pleased with its usefullness style. It arrived in two days of ordering 
I am a Mother of 6 and this works. You can put a few baby neccessities in it. I use it for a few diapers, baby wipes, desitin, and the bulb syringe. I can move it around and it does not take much space 
I orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things. It got too heavy everything wouldn't fit. So now I use it to hold his baby tylenol, etc. It is really nice. 
I purchased this to put on the changing table. I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc. I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one. It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc. I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over. This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby. The price was also reasonable. I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount. This basket is a great buy 
I received this at my shower and it is really nice. It is an attractive way to store misc baby items. Right now I am using it for diapering needs. Great price also 
We recently purchased this for our son's changing table in his room and are very pleased with it. It has pockets on the inside for small items such as comb, nail clippers, etc. And the inside is plenty big for a box of wipes. A cute addition to the nursery 
We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much. But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue. However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper. (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!) The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me. We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part. I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed. (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.) The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon. (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!) We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle. 
I got this for a baby gift and filled it with bath items. I thought it looked great and would be useful to use 
I have used this baby tub since my daughters belly button fell off. The net is very easy to use and it is very easy while washing the baby. I only quit using the net when my daughter started to roll. Now se sits up and has plenty of room to splash. I also like the elevated seat so that way she is not slipping and sliding all over the tub. My daughter also loves the toys that come with it 
When my third child was born, we got this tub. It has been the best yet for us. From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly. As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached. We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage. Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub. A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath. This is the position in which we currently use our tub. Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands. Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time. No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead 
I love this chair and so does my 5 month old. I love that it reclines 3 different postions and the best feature is it slides up and down to meet my level needs. Feeding him from any height is easy 
Great product. Son enjoys being in the chair. He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray. Only thing I don't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion 
I love this high chair and so does my daughter.It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food.The chair also folds compactly for storage.It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels.It has a height adjustment that is great.I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner.It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older.I love the chair pad, the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean.Which is great for moms since we hate a mess.It is very sturdy and safe.I also like the five point harness system.My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe.I highly recommend this product to new and old moms.I love it!!!!!!!!! 
This is a nice chair, except for the brakes. They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot, they lock. It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock. Since we are constantly moving the chair to us, or back to the wall, etc., this is a real problem because you have to unlock them (esp. if more than one of the four is locked) in order to move the chair easily. As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler, this is even harder. The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of. If it weren't for the brakes, I would give it 5 stars. The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water, easier for little ones to push 
We bought this highchair for our 7 month old daughter last weekend. She absolutely loves it. Love the piece in the middle of the seat that prevents baby from sliding down. The safety straps are extremely easy to use clean up is a snap. Our daughter loves the toys it comes with is thrilled to be sitting at the table with the rest of the family. Would definitely recommend this highchair 
Our son loves the toy. The buttons were hard for him to push initially. But at 10 months he was able to push the buttons to make the sounds. He loves it both on and off the chair. Our only complaint is the wheel locks lock too easily. They flip down with barely a touch, which can be annoying when you want to wheel the chair around alot, like we do in a small kitchen. 
My twins love these blocks. They received them as a gift at about 3 months old. At first they enjoyed just touching them, each side of the blocks have a different texture. Now that they are older (7 months) these blocks are one of their favortite toys. They can easily hold them, shake them and throw them 
My son loves these blocks! We introduced them to him around 3 months. He loves the colors, and is now starting to "pet" the different textures on the cubes! These are great toys even for teething. My son loves to chew on the little bumbs. His favorite cube would have to be the duck. He talks and squeals everytime the duck quacks. These cubes will also come in handy later when he is learning his colors and letters. We love Baby Einstein 
I bought these blocks when my son was a month old, he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them. The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby's eye. When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby's touch and they also have a unique feature too. Red and Blue are rattles, Yellow's duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green's frog vibrates when you pull his leg. These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a $10 value, they will keep your baby entertained and happy 
great attractive colors to the baby... but quite too big (and frustrating) a 5-6 month-old who's just starting to learn to grasp with one hand and just learning to navigate his opposable hands. 
My mother-in-law bought these for my daughter. At first, I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be, but my daughter took to them right away. In the beginning, she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise, but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures. She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up. They won't entertain her for hours, but she's always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day 
My som is 10 months old and loves these blocks. Some make noises. The yellow has a picture of a duck on it and makes a quacking sound. The green one has a picture of a frog and you pull the tail and it vibrates and my son loves that. There are also different textures on each block and my son really likes playing with them 
This bag is great to keep just the necessities and it will hold all your stuff (water, wallet, cell phone keys) plus your babies. The material is crunchy and noisy but does not make noise while walking only when reaching in and getting something 
My 20 month old loved this when I bought it for her and still plays with it daily now, 5 months later. I especially love the fact that it comes in a box so that all of the bits and pieces can be tidied away after play time in one central place, and there's no danger that anything gets lost. Definitely a must if your in the market for pretend kitchen play 
Sadly, I too found the Kwik Cabana III to be a terrific item ... the first time I set it up (inside our house, of course). When we actually took it to the beach and tried to open it up under "real world" conditions - Jersey shore in early September, and not particularly windy - one of the four support rods snapped at the top junction. We now own a $100 collection of poles and fabric, but not a cabana. It's too bad, because it's really a great design and so lightweight. Hopefully the manufacturer will design a stronger version (which I'd buy again) 
This tent was not as easy to pop up as the manufacturer claimed. We fussed with it a while before actually figuring out how to do it. No intructions came with the tent. The second time we tried to open it one of the spines broke and now the tent is useless. For $100 it shouldn't have broken that easily. When we had it up the first and only time, however, it was great. Our nine month old son loved it. I sat in the center of the tent while he crawled laps around me, chasing some little plastic balls. He liked hearing the crinkling of the tent fabric as he moved across it. The tent does need to be pegged in any kind of wind, but this is easy to do. Another reviewer said the tent was hot, but we're in Hawaii where there's always at least a breeze and it was fine. There is also a slit in the one wall of the tent which allows the wind to pass through. I'm going to try and contact the manufacturer about the lack of instructions and the relative fragility of the tent's parts. If I am satisfied with their response I will order the tent again. It really was great once it was set up. However, I will be more careful when opening it and will try and find a non-windy place to do it. 
I got this blanket to accompany the toddler set for my daughter's 3rd birthday. While the toddler bedding set isn't the highest quality in the world, this blanket is ultra soft and my daughter loves it 
This blanket is soooooo soft and warm and fuzzy. My 2 yr old got it for her birthday and she loves it. I love to wrap her up in it and cuddle with her. Its our favorite blanket. Not real big, but a nice big size for a toddler. If you are looking for a Dora blanket, this is a very good choice. I like it better than fleece. Its kind of fuzzy and almost silky feeling 
We just got this swing for our 3 1/2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago. Can I tell you she LOVES it!!! She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by. I LOVE the fact that it plugs in! I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO, I don't have batteries. Then while "I" was putting it together I saw that it plugged in....WOOOHOOOO! As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED! I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one, I just couldn't pay $159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price. BUT it would be worth the extra $$...we LOVE it that much! Rache 
I looked at this swing alot before buying and loved that it was pink and the light but hated spending that much on a swing.We had the jungle swing but she wouldnt sit in it she didnt like anything so I said I was going to try this I didnt care how much it cost if she would sit in it.Of course soon as i got it I put it together couldnt wait for my husband easy to do and she loves it she will just coo and laugh I love this swing and so does she I would reccomend this to anyone looking at it 
We've been using this for three weeks now and don't have a single complaint (yet). We love the fact that it's a plug-in too! Our little girl is mesmerized by the mobile and the music is almost hypnotizing (and surprisingly good quality). We don't use the tray or restraints so we can swaddle her before putting her down, and she's usually fast asleep within minutes. Once she starts interacting with toys, we'll use the activity tray and I'm sure she'll enjoy that as well. The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise, but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out. I would have rated it as 5 stars, but the color is not optimal -- we're not huge fans of pink, and would have rather chosen the blue swing with stars if it weren't $40 more 
This was given as a gift and the mom is ecstatic with it. It has light purple butterfly strobe lights that dance on the walls and ceiling when the the lights are off. The music choices are very soothing. This is a favorite. I have purchased a second one as a baby gift. The fact that it can be plugged in makes it very convenient to use. 
I ordered a baby swing from Amazon that cost me $114.00 total and all the other stores carried it for $159.00 plus shipping and tax. We were so impressed with how fast the item came and in perfect condition. The only way you could get it from other stores was on line also, so I figured I saved about a little over $60.00. Thank you Amazon for making our present to our first grand daughter a pleasant one 
Beautiful swing. My baby absolutely loves it!! There are so many options to choose from like the way she swings, the lights on, butterflies moving, songs that are played. I can say that she is comfortable enough to take naps in it. Very strong and sturdy. Swing is deep enough where baby won't fall out. Once again beautiful product that I love and my baby loves. Thanks Amazon! 
I got the Safe Bather over a year ago with my first son and am due with my second son and will be getting another for him. I used it in the sink when my son was an infant and then moved it into the tub as he grew. He NEVER cried when I bathed him and seemed very comfortable. It holds in the warm water too. As he got older he sat on it and I would just lay him down to wash his lower half. I never had any problems with it or any smell issues. It machined washed and tumbled dried easily. After each use I would ring out as much water as I could and just hang it up on the curtain rod and let it drip dry. I would recommend it to anyone! 
I love this stroller. It came and it was exactely what I wanted. Amazon got it here very quickly as promised. I am very satisfied with my purchase 
I love this stroller! First of all, it comes in fun, non-gender specific colors, unlike so many baby items. Second, it is extremely lightweight and easy to unfold one-handed (even while holding a baby). Third, the proportions of the stroller are perfect! My husband and I test-drove many umbrella strollers and found that we usually kicked the wheels (he is 6 feet tall, while I am 5'6"), but we don't with the Maclaren. Also, the handles are tall enough that he is not hunched over pushing the stroller. There are a lot of other great features, too. There is a carry strap that is great for transporting the stroller. The mesh seat keeps baby cool in the summer, and we purchased the "Volo accessory pack" which has a solid, padded seat liner which we use in the winter to keep baby warm. I do recommend getting the accessory pack, which also has a rain cover and carry-bag for the stroller. The basket under the seat in on the small side (forget about fitting a diaper bag in there) but I don't mind carrying the diaper bag because the stroller is so lightweight and manuverable. My only other issue is that the sun canopy does not tilt very far forward. Overall, we are very satisfied with the Maclaren Volo 
The Maclaren Umbrella Stroller is the best around. It's very lightweight and easy to manuver. It's worth the price and I would highly recommend this stroller for every mom with a child over 1 year old. The only drawback is that the basket under the seat can only hold up to 5 lbs. This stroller is easy to open and close and fits nicely in the trunk of your car 
Goregous Stroller!!!! We had those cheapo umbrella strollers but our 2 1/2 year old was to tall for it, and it wasnt wide enough, she looked very squished. This came in the mail today and its perfect!!! Light weight, tall handles with light padding, nice break system, beautiful colors/materials, our toddler is not squished she has plenty of room (shes 35lbs, 37" tall)I dont feel hunched when I walk with it, great place for a storage pouch, wide and long canopy. Its just perfect well worth the $$. Im buying another for our new son for when hes old enough. Great deal!!!! Buy one!!!!! :) Im very happy 
This stroller is wonderful. I initially bought it strictly for travel but love its ease of use so much that it is used daily. Pros: Lightweight, great carrying strap, easily folds, takes up very little space in your trunk, and the turquoise is a great unisex color. Cons: once it is folded you can not lean it up against something without it falling. With the carrying strap this is not a big deal. This is a very minor issue that does not keep me from recommending this stroller to all my friends and family. 
This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often. We have a more expensive, larger, "safer" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one. Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground. We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel. The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes. There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get. The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try. The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new. We should get sales rep compensation, because no one really had these in Paris and all our friends saw ours and got one too 
While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2-1/2, she wasn't making it thru the night so we used Pull Up every night. Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups. We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a fluke then invested in *two* of these pads. The tuck in feature on both sides is great I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep. She finds it comfortable as she's never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups sleeping in regular underwear). The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one. No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night. For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I've got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can't be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible. I've washed them a number of times they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous. I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we've never had a problem. It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven't tested that, I've never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in. We haven't found a down side to these pads. Even the price isn't bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you'll find them a few bucks less, but not by much. And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night. I've read that most toddlers' bladders aren't large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone's happy!) Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road. I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem. 
Great for vacation, visits to Grandma's, or just to have around in case a friend or cousin drops by. Inexpensive and very functional 
My son has been using this seat since he was able to sit unassisted. The chair is very easy to assemble and disassemble. It is also dishwasher safe, which is helpful for those really messy situations. The removable tray is great for getting the mess away from him, so I can clean him up without him getting messy again. He is now almost 20 months old, and we still use it (now as a booster). He is tall for his age, but it still fits him well (with plenty of room to grow). As for the complaints about it not fitting larger babies, I don't really know. My son is very slender, but there is quite of bit of "breathing room" for him. We make frequent trips to grandma's house and to friends' houses and this seat is very travel friendly. All in all, this is a great product at a great price. 
The basic idea is great and the ease of assembly is nice - no tools needed. We have used it with all the grandchildren (6) and one nephew.  I think it needs some design improvements:  (1) the straps which are used to hold it to a chair would be better if there were a strap which went from front to back, not just around the back of the seat. One of the grandkids seems unable to sit still and I keep expecting him to tip over the chair because it tends to slide sideways in the front.  (2) the tray is designed for a slim child. On one side, the tray fits a finger like protusion into a hole. On the other side, there are 2 places to attach the tray in slots. Only when the tray is in the innermost position, is it aligned directly in front of the child and there isn't a great deal of tummy room. If you move the tray to the outer position (available on one side only), the tray is cocked at an angle and it still probably wouldn't accomodate a child with a larger stomach.  (3) the belts to hold the child need to be longer.  Fortunately for us, all the grandkids and nephew are slim. At least so far 
My son is 13 months old and 25 pounds. One mother wrote that her 10 month old 24 pound baby could not fit in it, but my son fits into it fine with room to grow and he is even considered a &amp;quot;big baby&amp;quot;. I think that people need to take into consideration the height and weight proportion when buying the product. Every child is different, with different weight and height which means different shapes. Instead of my huge high chair in the kitchen, I now have a small booster that stays in one of the kitchen table seats and slides right under the table w/ the chair when my son is not in it. It is a great space saver. 
I recently purchased this seat for my 1 year old daughter and used it last week at the beach. The chair easily and securely fit on the chair. The tray stayed attached, unlike other models I had tried. My daughter enjoyed many meals in her new seat. Cleaning it was a breeze as was packing it for travel. This is a great seat at a great price 
This was purchased as a gift for our daughter, but too big to be shipped to us overseas. So it remained at my mothers house until we came to visit. Ever since we put it together (which was very easy) she has played with it everday. She likes it so much that we are placing it in our suitcases to take back overseas with us. Easy to disassemble as well so we took it with us to visit the in-laws in North Carolina, which gave her plenty to do. It also served as a feeding chair while we were visiting. 
My 9 month old baby has mild CP. We bought this seat for her when she was younger, but she is just now able to use it. She loves it. It has worked well to help her with her balance, her muscle control and provides a safe environment for her to play. It is limited with the number of activities. Our only complaint is that we have to check the screws on the bottom of the bouncy foot rest, because they often fall out. But we just check it periodically and it hasn't been a problem. I have a few pictures of Hope in her seat in the customer photo section for this seat 
I bought the Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone not only because of the price but the fact that it is not as big and round as others. It is perfect for our apartment with not-a-lot of space. My 6 month old loves it, she bounces in it and chews on all the toys. She loves to spin the ball around, she moves the see-saw animals up and down as it makes a wonderful clicky noise she gets a kick out of (not loud). The bar going across is pretty close to her head but she doesn't hit her head on it. She chews on the zebra connected to the mirror and spins the caterpillar heads around.. it's really very nice, while not being so busy and bulky when unneccesary like others 
My daughter loves it. I got it for her at 4 months. Like the other users, I just put a blanket around her until she balanced better. She likes the sounds it makes when she bounces on it, its not too bouncey though so it helped her learn how to stand and built up those leg muscles. She loves turning around in the rotating seat and can get the ball going really fast. She likes the mirror because she can reach it to adjust it and chew on the zebra if she wants. She is fascinated with the seesaw toy that clicks as she moves it from side to side. She will spend hours in this toy. The piano is a little hard to reach but at 6 months she can hit it easily now. 
I am very busy in the evening, cleaning, cooking, homework, laundry, etc. I can place my daughter in her activity zone wherever I am and she will play and watch me without fussing. This toy is a life saver. I would be lost without it 
I did not bathe my infant in the sink. I put her in this and put her in the tub with a little water. This bather is soft and dries quickly. I also washed it in the washing machine and it didn't shrink. I would highly recommend this product for an infant 
I have tried 2 different plastic bathtubs. The first one was sturdy and spacious but it has a bump that was very uncomfortable around my baby's waistline. The other one has a fabric sling on top of the plastic bathtub. It provided good support but my baby felt wobbly. Both bathtubs prove to be unsatisfactory. I use this bath form in my shower cubicle (on the floor) with a long flexible shower head. My baby does not fuss in it as she feels secured. It dries very quickly. Great product with a reasonable price. 
The SaferBather is soft and easy to clean. It dries easily and can be stored when not in use. I love it...the baby loves it...and that is what sells this product 
Although we didn't buy this through Amazon, this product is terrific! Our son has special needs (CP) and has been using this for 2 years!!! We're actually getting ready to replace it as the first one is finally wearing out, and we have another baby on the way! It dries really fast and the included hook keeps it out of the way on the shower head. Can't say enough how great this item has been. 
I got this as a shower gift although it wasn't on my registry. I had no idea how perfect it would be 
Este producto es tanto mejor que las bañeritas porque te da más flexibilidad. Lo comencé a usar cuando mi bebé tenía unos cuatro meses y la bañerita comenzó a ser incómoda ya que no tenía un buen espacio donde ubicarla. El Safer Bather se coloca en la bañera, no se resbala y el bebé queda muy cómodo. Mi bebé tiene ahora 10 meses y medio y le gusta sentarse para jugar mientras lo baño y aún así resulta fabuloso. Además, se puede lavar en la lavadora y seca bastante rápido. Aún las veces que no lo he lavado enseguida, no ha olido mal. Creo que es un producto excelente 
I used this product with my 1st baby and loved it. Now, with my twins I definately had to have another!!! It's much easier to handle the babies on the safer bather than the regular baby tubs 
I used this on my bathroom counter for sponge baths the first week. Now I put it in the bathtub and fill the water up to the edge. The safer bather warms right up. My baby never cries when he gets a bath! When I am finished, I simply wring the safer bather out and hang it up. Couldn't be easier 
I love this bath "tub." We have been using it from the time our baby was just one week old for sponge baths. He is now 2 months old, and he loves bath time! This product is great. It is very soft, and it seems comfortable. I wish I had one for my baths! Our baby loves bath time. The pillow stays warm with the bath water. Just be sure to hang it to dry after bath time to avoid a chilly pillow at the next bath. It dries quickly and is easy to care for. Love it! 
This item was a must for our son who has had acid reflux from 6 weeks on...Yes, a baby will slide down eventually as they start to move and kick, but it was perfect for putting him down at night after nursing. By the time he would slide down, hours had passed and he was due for another feeding. Our son, 4 months old, 13.5 lbs. and 25 inches long, still uses it every night. Even if he eventually moves down, it doesn't matter. He LOVES the memory foam and it is so comfortable for him to sleep in. ALSO, our pediatrician took note because he was impresed with hiw it is so good for preventing flattening in the back of the head, It distributes the weight better. Great for a baby who hates tummy-time 
My son was born 13 wks premature. When he finally came home from the hospital I was very concerned about his sleep position. I got the Inclined to sleep as part of my baby shower and I love it and so does my preemie baby. It is really soft and the velcro sides are adjustable. 
We chose this mattress because of its firmness (not too hard or too soft)and for its vinyl cover. We went with a higher priced option, but not over the top expensive. To be perfectly honest, we didn't know what else to look for in a crib mattress, I mean, how do you really test one. Well, our twins slept well together on one until they had to be separated into two cribs where they also slept very well. They are about 3 weeks shy of 3 years old and are still sleeping on the mattress in their toddler beds. We found that they fit the crib very well (no dangerous gaps), held up to changing and normal use. The mattresses both still look and feel new. By the way, the kids are both average sized. We are getting ready to buy another for our third child. I definitely recommend this mattress 
We recently bought this mattress a little over 2 weeks and it's great for the toddler bed. It said that with time and movement from baby the corner edges will spread to fit the bed frame better. It fits fine right now. I would not buy this mattress for a baby because I think it is too soft but for my toddler who loves to sleep our soft bed and loves pillows this is perfect. 
I absolutely love this matress. I purchased a high end crib from USA Baby and they tried to to convience me to purchase these ridiculously priced matresses. I decided to get the best quality matress offered from Babies R Us. This matress is much better than anything they are offering for over $150 dollars. The delivery was quick and easy. I LOVE AMAZON/BABIESRUS and I LOVE THIS MATRESS. Absolutely perfect!! 
I bought this monitor to replace my Sound and Lights monitor because it was picking up the neighbor's house instead of mine. The 10 channels on this monitor make sure that I don't have that problem anymore. The best part about this monitor is that it actually does work outside like it's supposed to. Our old sound and lights was supposed to, but wouldn't even work if you just stepped out onto the porch. This private connection monitor I can take all the way down to the mail box or my husband can set it up in the garage while he's doing projects and the reception is great 
since my baby was born i changed 3 monitors, i used to hear a lot if interruptions and sometimes the neighbours phone conversations... this fisherprice monitor is great, u can chose any channel and no interruptions heard.. go for it.. thanks for amazon as well. Xeen 
I bought this thing for my new nephew and I'm satisfied, his parents told me That was the best gift they received, I recommend it, excellent product 
Finally a product from Fisher Price that is worth the money!! These are the second set of Fisher Price monitors we have purchased and are loving them - unlike the first set. We especially love having 10 different channels to select from, reception display, battery display, rechargable batteries, low battery alarm, terminal/reciever disconnection alarm, and most of all clear sound and NO static. We struggled for months with another model of monitors from Fisher Price and ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation from family. We are glad to ditch the other ones and are completely happy with these! 
After reading all the other reviews posted,I was a little apprehensive about buying this monitor. However, there was such a good deal on the price that I decided to take my chances and purchase it any way. To start with, I was surprised at how easy it was to set it up and even more pleasantly surprised with how clear the sound is, it's as if the baby is right there beside me. I really had to wonder if we are all talking about the same monitor. I have absolutely no complaints. It was so clear, I could make out the song in the vehicle driving by on the road. I hear even more than I really need to, ha ha. I would suggest that you just make sure no other appliance in the house is running on 2.4GHz and you shouldn't have a problem. Hope this helps... I have no complaints 
This is a good looking functional gate that the toddlers cannot open, but most of us adults can open with one hand. (I had to show a couple of guests how to do it without damaging it). We had trouble with the delivery, only because UPS left it at the entryway of the wrong house - - - the one next to us that was empty and up for sale. Assembly was a little difficult because the instructions were all pictures with very few words. If it is being installed between two walls that have no molding obstructions, it's fine. However, in my case, I have the high 6-inch baseboard and I have wainscotting with a chair-rail. These moldings created uneven surfaces and I could not install the gate without making wooden spacer blocks that I had to paint white to match the gate. It took me five hours to get it done, and I'm handy (although a bit of a perfectionist). Anyhow, it looks and works great, and we've gotten compliments about it. I thought it was a bit expensive, but I could not find anything else that looked good; as it is installed at the top of the stairs leading into our formal dining room. Despite the work to install it and the high price, it was worth it to me. 
After trying four other models of safety gate, I am happy to have finally found the one that works for me. I use this gate for my dogs, but it would be equally effective for a baby. It is sturdy, easy to operate, good-looking, and as unobtrusive as a gate can be. This gate is not pressure-mounted. It needs to be screwed into the wall on both sides. However, I have learned the hard way that the pressure-mounted gates do a lot of damage to walls, they are more difficult to operate, and they are bulky. If the need for a gate is going to be relatively long-term, I now believe that it is easier to screw it in and worry about patching the wall when the time comes. I've also learned that gates with vertical bars are more likely to be left alone because it's more difficult for pups to get a purchase on them. The ones with grids or cross-pieces encourage dogs to rattle them -- and to jump, a habit that I work hard to extinguish 
I too am very pleased with this gate. Over the past week I installed one each at the top of our two staircases. I strongly recommend following the advice of one of the other reviewers to skip using the template. The lower fixture on the hinge side is lowest to the ground, so I installed that first, then held it in place to mark the spot for the upper hinge. After that was on, I put the gate on the hinges, held it in place and marked the opposite side. Worked great, and it allowed me to work around the mouldings, which would have been difficult with the template. The wood screws held great in the one bannister on one staircase. On the other staircase, I had to put the gates into drywall. There was a beam on one side, so I had to buy much longer screws to ensure a tight grip. The other side was hollow, so I bought some good metal anchors, so the gate is on very tight. All I did was bring the fixtures to the hardware store and found screws and anchors that would fit the holes. Cost me about $10 to get enough anchors and screws for four gates. Most of the poor reviews sound like there are some hardware issues. I take one star away because I think the gate should come with alternate screws, and maybe anchors, because I think it's a bad assumption that most people are installing into wood. I would very much recommend this gate, but advise paying close attention to what you're installing into first and make sure you've got the right hardware 
We love the gate and finally found a piece of hardware to attach to wall to keep it open when you are not trying to keep babies out.... no more clanging open and closed. McMaster Carr - 13985A26 Stainless Steel Spring-Action Tool Holder Type 302 They come in packs of 5 and can also be used to hang tools or brooms...  
We really like this gate. We have a very wide stair case and bought the extension to go with this gate. (make sure you get the right extension) IT IS AWESOME! My husband is really good with projects so we kind of made it better by putting a different latch then the one that was sent. We also put some longer screws so that it would w/o a doubt stay in the wall. It has been able to withstand our daughter pushing on it, hitting it w/her walker, and our doberman trying to get down our stairs. So, all in all, it is a wonderful gate for children animals! 
When you need to babyproof your house--especially for those of us who have stairs--don't look any further--this is the gate to use. We had this installed in our former house at the top and bottom of the stairs. Very safe and secure. Our sons tried to climb on it, but couldn't--yanked on it and it wouldn't budge. In our new house, we have a different type of stairs and no gate would work, so we installed these same gates leading to the stairs. Our hallway is wider so we just had to purchase the extensions. Perfect. It prevented our boys from getting up the stairs unsupervised. We just had our third baby (girl), so my husband will be installing these same gates again soon. 
I did a lot of research 2 1/2 yrs ago for a gate for the top of our stairs when we had our little girl. I now have a 2 1/2 yr old and an 10 mo old, they shake it and stand at it, but it is secured to the wall and they can't open it. We are buying a 2nd one for the bottom of our stairs in our new house 
The quality of this set is high as all items are very well made. Very pleased with purchase 
All of Medela products (nursing pads, lanolin, bras, pumps, etc...) are definitely the best that I've tried (and I've tried most all mainstream brands). This bra in particular is EXTREMELY comfortable on sore nipples. I have sensitive skin and nipples and I found this to be the best there is (Bravado was too rough for me as were some other night nursing bras I tried). The material is sort of a pantyhose type of material where when you slip it on, it feels as though there's nothing there but it protects and supports your sensitive breasts (especially important during the first several weeks of first time nursing). It's not really a bra that you'd want to wear on an evening out as it's more of a sports type bra and it would not support adequately for high impact activities (like aerobics, etc...) but it's perfect for around the house or errand running or low impact activities such as yoga. As a larger breasted women (especially breast feeding - I went from a 36DD to a 36G), this bra works perfectly for me for support and comfort. It's a MUST HAVE for anyone who is breastfeeding 
I love this bra and recommend it to all my friends. I had bought mine from the hospital a year ago and wear it all the time. I have several maternity bras and this one by far is the most comfortable one I have 
this product is workin darn good for me. ya so what a couple things fall out of place you people act like your kids toy box stays organized. there are only 12 pieces in there its not that hard to sort through and put them back in their respective slots. and the handle issue.........grab it by the bottom....ur an adult you dont need a lunch pale anymore.....and the person crying about it not staying securely latched get creative and shove a little tape behind the clip...it will stay extended and lock in place....good product........good price......what more can you ask for. 
Love the Sunshade. For the most part works well, except if you are running in rather windy conditions, then, it just flies back and does not cover the kids so well. I really use my double jog stroller for jogging and am happy to have the sunshade, the kids like it too. The only other frustration is if you have a small child who is rather reclined in the stroller and the sun is close to setting, you may not get good coverage to keep the sun out of eyes unless you pull the shade completely over the stroller . . . then the older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out! 
We have been using these diapers with our daughter for from birth to currently 5 months old. They have never leaked the runny breastfed poop. Would get soaked if we didn't change her often enough, but she may be a supersoaker! They are very soft and stretchy, never leave red marks on her leg. Lots of snaps to fit all sized babies. They do take a while to dry. We wash ours, then do a cycle in the dryer and then hang to finish drying. Overall a great diaper. Would recommend to anyone wanting to try cloth diapers for the first time 
I used them on my son for 6 months. They were so wonderfully soft and easy to use, once I got the hang of it. They are very thick, so they take awhile to dry. Overall, I loved them and I miss using them! If only the laundry fairy would visit! 
These diapers hold in newborn poo - better than anything. After watching lots of friends wash their babies clothes everytime they pooped - because it leaked out of a disposable - I deciced to got with kissaluvs- and just change a diaper instead of a whole outfit!We used these for 2 months solid with proraps and bummis super whispher wrap ( my favorite). When have given a four - except - at 2 months my baby started to HATE having wetness next to her skin - at all - and it would wake her from her naps( could use a fleece liner and solve that problem) and they take FOREVER to dry - I'll hang them on the line all day and then still have to dry them for 20 mins.- Overall they are GREAT 
This little kit is two in one. It has all that you need for grooming and all that you need for baby health. The only thing we don't use is the clippers because we like the one that 1st years has with the magnifing glass. The comb and brush are perfect, and she absolutely LOVES the rattle! Surprise! I thought it was just kind of an extra, but we take it with us everywhere. The suction bulb isn't that bad like others have said. The case that it comes in is really great! It has a pocket for storing other things in the back which we use for nose drops, tylenol, etc. Having it all in one place is great because we can easily grab it and go if we are going to grandma's. I'm sure we'll be using this into her toddler years! 
This is a great set to have, you have everything that you need in one handy sturdy caring case. This product can go anywhere with you or sit perfect in the nursery. Has been a wonderful help and will continue to be a wonderful help. Best baby shower gift that we got 
When we had our kids, this mirror was really great for giving the rear-facing child seat occupant (that would be our boys) a view of the driver and the driver a view of their faces. Soon enough they outgrew the seating layout and the mirror got stowed in the door pocket. It was great for the kids and us and we really got a lot of use out of it. But wait, we weren't done with it yet! When I got my Jeep, I happened to come across the little mirror again and decided to try it for a blind spot mirror. I never liked those little circular ones that go on the side mirrors because they take up too much room and they're so small they aren't really very useful. Instead I stuck this mirror up on the left corner of my windshield where the only thing it blocked is low flying aircraft. And it provides a rear-view that covers my blind spot perfectly and is large enough to actually see what's going on. The added bonus is that because it's inside, it never gets wet, icy or fogged up. It's been on my windshield ever since. The kids are 7 and 9 now so that little mirror is almost a decade old and it still sticks to the window and has survived several bumps and never broke! Not bad for a few bucks 
I LOVE this potty!! My 16 month old daughter sits on it for a long time before wanting off, it seams comfortable. Her little feet touch the ground so she feels stable. I would recommend this chair 
I purchased two big boy potty books that arrived a few days before this potty did. We had a different potty that did not work well for boys at all. Once this potty got here he has not had one accident!!! He just turned two yesterday and he loves his potty! He gets excited every time he goes and claps for himself proclaiming that he is a big boy!!! I would highly recommend this potty!!!! Don't keep searching buy this one! I threw his other potty right in the garbage 
I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL. HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT. WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY. I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE FAMILY, OR IN HIS ROOM. I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT. I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN, EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR. MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL. SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON'T STAY PUT. I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP, SLIDE, OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD. THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED. HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT!!! I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT! HE WAS HOOKED. I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE "I DID IT!!!! MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT." HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK. WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS. IT IS GREAT! EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW. IF MY SON WASN'T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL. THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD'S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE...MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE!!! THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNED ME WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS. 
I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son. We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size. He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. One reviewer said the sprout was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable sprout and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull of the sprout and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him focus on going potty. I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair 
My 16 month old son enjoys sitting on his potty chair. It suits the contour of the body but unfortunately for boys, the tip of the front guard is a bit shy in height, he needs to sit very still to prevent a "waterfall" from going over the guard. I still like this chair, its very easy to clean, he seems to find it comfortable 
Purchased this potty for my 2 year old daughter. She enjoyed just sitting on it. It's comfortable and fits her just right. She'll even sit and read while she goes. Love the pull out bowl feature. Great for dumping and cleaning in a jiffy. My daughter even feels proud because she can help dump it. Easy to use. No buttons, no whistles, no ways for it to fall apart. Thrilled we picked a terrific potty the first time. We're getting a second one in a different color for her bedroom upstairs since she's starting to use it more often. Highly recommended 
This neoprene organizer is the best! I didn't know how much stuff I wasn't bringing until I got it. Now I am always remembering stuff in the organizer on the stroller in the car. It really is handy, highly recommende 
This works well and is a thick quality product. I didn't want to pay this much but after getting it, so worth the money. It stays on well. 
When my son began climbing out of his crib, we cringed. We live in a townhouse and his room is a 14' x 30' space in our walkout basement. One portion of this area is used for our storage and exercise equipment, however, so we were very nervous that he would pull something down on himself. I realize that the manufacturers do not advertise this use, but it is possible to link these gates end to end in order to cover a longer stretch. The gate cleans up easily and was much less expensive (even with needing to purchase two) than the other configuration gate options. Our son is 19 mos old and 38" tall (very tall) and he has not gone over the gate- he leaves it alone! He is able to climb over many of the plastic and metal pressure gates. It did take a bit of installation time (about an hour for both gates), and you will need basic skills to install it. One other thing, my husband had to go out and buy a drill bit that was the right size for the gate install- 7/32", so be prepared. This was the best $200 I've spent on toddler products thus far 
A bit difficult to install, the guide for marking the placement of the screws was slightly off so we couldn't fit the feet on, but that's okay because we didn't actually need them. Looks nice, better than the white barred gates. I find it easy to open. I can do it one handed once you figure out how to do it. EASY TO CLEAN! We have the gate up to keep kids in our out of the kitchen. When eating lunch they tend to touch the gate with sticky messy hands but wipes off easily with a wet cloth. People often comment how nice the gate is. I love the neutral color. Happy with the purchase 
We purchased this gate to fit around the base of an odd shaped staircase (for those interested, it's the front stairwell of the Wellington plan by Centex Homes - it's really popular down here in Centex subdivisions so I thought I'd share). I was concerned about finding anything that would cover this area because of odd shape but this gate did the job in spades. And it was a breeze to install (at least compared to some other gates). I had it installed within 1 hour. As is usual with these kind of things, if you are installing into sheetrock, be forewarned that the anchors that come with the gate hardware are pooky and you will need to buy some decent ones at the hardware store. That's really my only complaint, but it's seems to always be the case with any factory-provided hardware these days. We are very pleased with it and it was worth the money. 
With the mixed reviews this gate has, I hesitated in buying it, but I wish I hadn't! My house is rather small but there is a large open area between the kitchen,living room,hallway, and door to basement; this is the highest traffic area in the house. Also, none of the walls or corners are straight across from each other making it impossible to use a more "traditional" gate. I actually found it easier not to attach this gate to the wall so I can change what part of the house I want my daughter to have access to. It is possible for the gate to tip over if my 2-year-old daughter is playing with it, so I made a rule that she is not allowed to "play" with the gate. It took her about a day to adjust but now she has no problem with it. I'm not sure about the durability of the gate since I have not had it long, but I think the price is well worth my daughter's safety and my peace of mind 
Easy to install and to essamble. We have two of these gates that we use for a large play area for or twins 
This gate is really adaptable and attractive. I use it for puppy safety and containment. It works great 
My husband and I bought this gate to keep our precocious and exceptionally curious toddler out of the kitchen. (It took her about a week to figure out how to open all the safety locks on the cabinets.) When the gate arrived the box was heavily damaged and the gate was broken. We called customer service at Summer and they had a new gate and free return shipping label to us in three days! Installation was fairly easy for my husband who is not particularly handy with tools. We like the fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates. The only thing I don't like quite so much is that the latching mechanism is not terribly easy to use. You have to line up the gate and then pull slightly on the handle to seat the latch properly. Takes a little while to get used to. All-in-all we would definitely recommend this gate to others who have large openings to close off 
I ordered two of these gates to block off spaces that are about nine feet long and these do the trick! These gates allow me to stop my baby from going up a staircase, down a staircase or out a door using all three panels which expand up to twelve feet. If you don't need all that length you can detach a panel or use it in a v-shape to angle it while using all three panels. I found it so easy to install just using two brackets on each wall. The screws and anchors provided were all I needed to install into drywall. Plus they give you a template to make it even easier to line up the screws. The gate swings open in either direction and is easy to open for an adult but I don't think my baby will figure it out for years to come. I am so happy that I invested in this gate rather than buying multiple gates to block all the stairs 
My daughter loves her new doll house. She's twelve and has always wanted one. Because she is 12 I felt that I needed to buy a large doll house and this one is the perfect size. It looks really pretty in her room. It was really easy to assemble too. I only wish that it came with doll furniture 
My son is now 2 weeks old and loves to be nuzzeled in between the postioners with his head up against the head piece. I have already washed it, and no complaints here. Washed beautifully. The only complaint I do have is that I wish they would have put more velcro on the postioners to keep them in place. They are kind of scimpy and often the head piece comes undone 
It gave me the piece of mind that my son is safe. It also fits in the bassinet that I purchased. The one thing it needs is a little wedge so my son's head is elevated but all in all this is a great piece of item to have. It's nice to know that pieces can be moved around so that you can custom fit it to your child's growth spurt 
This has proved to be one of the very useful gifts that we had, especially being new parents.We started using this right when we brought our daughter home from the hospital. This holds the baby whether they are sleeping along with the parents, in the crib and on the craddle. Highly recommended 
I bought this gift set to go with the Fisher Price sassy chair for my seven month old grandson. The toys hold his attention and are easy to either affix to the tray or use on their own. They make it easier to feed him and give us some time while he plays 
The Boppy is an absolute MUST HAVE for every new mom! Even if you are not going to nurse, it helps with supporting the baby during feeding, giving you an extra arm. For me, it was a life saver for those middle of the night feeds, I could rest my son on it, latch him on, recline a bit, and many nights we would both fall back asleep! I buy this item for everyone I know who is expecting a baby now 
This is a perfect solution when you have a large space and need to confine pets or small children. By adding the extension pieces, you can easily expand it's size. An added bonus is you don't need to mount the gate to a wall! Also, it's heavy enough to safely confine and light enough to move 
I have 3 kids and 2 dogs and I am so happy that I purchased this gate. I bought it when my 2nd child was born and it has become a consistant item in my house. We moved and I was concerned about the different size of the openings. There was not a problem. It is easy enough for my 5 year old to open, but sturdy enough to withstand my 2yr old and 1 yr old. I love the gate in regards to pets because it makes having company easy. I can keep my dogs in the house and yet they are away from my company. With out the gate I would be constantly fighting my toddlers to keep them out of the kitchen/trash/litter box/cabinets. Everyone who comes over to visit and has children or pets ask about the gate! Even though the price of the gate is kind of high, it is something that keeps giving. I love my gate even after almost 3 years 
What the previous reviewer didn't realize is that there are 2 different packaging options for this item. The first option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product. So make sure you really read the description of what you're getting if you're buying online. (This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first...I actually rec. it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn't work with all situations because of draw designs) Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product, love it, and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key. I will admit that I think it's pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you're dealing with child safety products. As far as how well the product works...I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations! It's especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don't have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side. I didn't have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn't flush with where you put the catch. I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it's actually a great product. I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there. I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets...I mean give me a break...the holes are so small anyway and it's totally concealed, only you will know it's there. ALSO, this locks so tight that little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings (which usually occures with the other types of locks) and pull stuff out. And also there's an option to turn the lock off for in between kids. DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT!!!! 
My floor was becoming a sea of crunched-up Goldfish crackers and smooshed raisins. Car rides consisted of me with a Tupperware of snacks passing them back to my one-year-old because given the chance, he would dump the whole thing. So Snack Traps are a life-saver. He can still reach in, grab a handful and throw if he wants to, but mostly they've helped keep things clean. 
This is the greatest thing ever invented for little kids. My son would take an entire handfull of snacks/fruit if he was able. These snack traps control the amount he can take out at a time. I also appreciate that this vendor shipped to an APO 
And glad I could buy a 3-pack. If my baby doesn't lose one of these, I will 
This is the best, wish I'd invented it! No more ziploc bags being wasted, no more Cheerios all over the supermarket floor! This little cup lets the child reach in with fingers pull out several treats (cheerios, goldfish, etc) and munch away without spilling. No more mess or crumbs all over the car, store, house, etc! I LOVE IT! Bought a 3 pack, twice! I keep one in my diaper bag for road trips! My daughter was using it at 1 yr old 
As others have said, the lid is easily removed even by a very young child. The first time we used it, our son took the lid off and spilled the snacks. But after a few times, he figured out that if he took the lid off the snacks would spill, and stopped taking the lid off. We find it very useful for our now 27-month-old (we started using it probably a year ago). It is not perfect but we have not found a substitute 
I ordered the piddle pad a week before the birth of my third baby. I wanted to put it in his car seat to avoid the poop blow outs (caused by breast milk) all over his car seat. With my other two kids I was always cleaning their car seats when they were first born. Here is the only problem I found with the product. It doesn't fit into the infant carrier when it is set for a brand new baby. It was too big, no matter what I did it would not work. Not wanted to return a product I was sure would come in handy I moved it to my 20 month old's car seat and it worked and fit great. As a matter of fact after two weeks worth of use it finally got a chance to prove itself when it saved my son's car seat from the milk shake treat my husband had given him. It absorbed the drink and saved the seat. Easy clean up,For once I didn't have to disasemble the car seat so I could wash it. Great product for bigger babies and toddlers, ect....But not for newborns. 
We got this item as a gift and even before opening the package, I thought "FINALLY!!!". We've had a few leaks on long raod trips and the PiddlePad is fantastic. Now it's just one little easily washable insert to throw in the wash, instead of trying to wrestle apart the car seat to take the cover off to wash it. And then you have to try and get it all back together again. Ever seen a second-hand car seat at a consignment store or garage sale??? Now you know why they're so filthy! No one bothers to pull them apart to clen them. We can't rave enough about the PiddlePad! 
I have used many slings in the past and this sling is by far the best!!! It is easy to use- and to learn to use. Our baby loves her sling- and settles down immediatly after we put her in it. I can clean my house, walk our dog, shop, etc. and she is nestled safely in her sling. My husband also wears this sling and states, "It is the best baby product we bought!" Likewise, it is lightweight and we live in a very hot climate- she doesn't get too hot in this sling. I used mine every day for several hours a day- and as I write this, our daughter is nestled in with me! This is a must have item for any new mom or dad 
Spend the money, it's easier than back packs or slings with rings, folds up into a purse, can use it anywhere, sturdy. Don't bother with the knock-offs, this is the only one I've found that works. Love it 
I love this sling! I didn't bother to learn how to use it with my first child, but I am so glad I did with the second. It is wonderful. It was hard to learn because I didn't have anyone to teach me, but the website has video instructions, which are so easy to follow. I learned with a doll. I can nurse in it anywhere, and he almost always falls asleep as soon as he's in it. It helps me have hands free to play with my toddler. I think this will become a staple with me and my future babies. 
We have had two of these rails for about three years now and are very happy with them. They have stood up to plenty of kicks and shoves from an active sleeper. The rails can be contracted when we need to transport them. On our twin mattress the rails take up about 2.5 inches off each side. I must admit that I did not know how to use the rails properly at first and thought they were challenging to remove. My husband, who read the directions, installed them easily and gave me a quick demo on how to adjust them. Once I was patient enough to learn how to use them, it was quick and easy to manuever them. These rails are secure and durable, ones that will last through younger siblings as well. 
There is no gap for your child to potentially fall into...it locks ontop and if you use it right, you can easily change your sheets. It is the only one to be considered, even though it is more expensive 
Simple enough to set up. Just like a previous review indicated, you just have to read the directions. I could not understand how people had problems with this rail system. It took less than 5 minutes to set two of these up. Make sure all the parts click in place and are locked. It is super strong and locked to the mattress. I would recommend this to anyone looking for bed rails 
We like this bed railing and it serves its purpose and more. This bed rail is very forgiving considering my daughter always uses it as a bar to climb onto her bed. Don't understand how the other reviewer said that "it stuck out so far." I have to agree with the other reviewer that the railing wasn't probably installed right by the user. If you installed it correctly, the bed railing should even actually take some of the bed space (about 2 or 3 inches). 
I read the reviews before purchasing this product which helped me in making the decision. I found this product easy to use, there's no need for any kind of intallations and it worked great for my daughter's bed....I did not find the locking system hard to do at all.....I would recommend this produc 
I love this mirror. It is big and gives you good , clear view of your baby.Plus she/ he had good entertainment. 
This is a great distraction for little ones of any age almost, BUT, do not lose the remote! If it is misplaced, falls out of vehicle because a little one heaved it over the side like my guy does with everything, there is no way to turn it on without the remote! Both the mirror and remote use up batteries pretty quick when you let the child play with it by turning it on and off. Other than that its a wonderful sleepy time, night time distraction without letting the your child play with the remote. At night it lights up in different places on the frame softly while playing music which isn't so loud its going to keep them awake. I would buy it again or give it as a gift 
I originally purchased this as a way to keep an eye on my daughter, since she was in the back seat of our van. It turned out to be a sanity saving device . We live by train tracks, and the music and lights help to distract her while we wait. I will say, though, that the cold weather zapped the batteries, so maybe re-chargeables are in order for this toy. My toddler also loves it. He uses the remote to turn it on and off, which in itself entertains his sister 
I bought this for my car shortly after my son was born so I could keep an eye on him. I love this mirror, it keeps my son very happy when he is tired and often puts him to sleep which is great. The music isn't to annoying and the lights are slow enough that they don't bother me while I drive. It's also a great price! My son is 5 months old now and we still use it all the time. I would highly recommend this mirror! It has several different ways to attach to the car as well, so it works in almost every car 
I saw this item on a relative's registry and decided to buy one when I was getting ready for our second child. I thought it would be a good way for our three year old to "admire" the new baby without having to hold him all the time. It works great for that- but even better for keeping our baby asleep! He is a spitter, and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks. A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings. This serves that purpose perfectly. It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up! Only word of warning- make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping. Our son managed to wriggle over the side a bit. 
We love this pillow. My daugter is 2 months old and she naps on it. It fits inside her pack and play and she lays on it for a nice long nap. It keeps her from rolling over. It also fits on the couch in between me and my husband so we can enjoy together 
This is perfect for a newborn. Pros: Soft fabric, small, portable, soft filling, supports a newborn perfectly. Cons: Long list of places you can't use it (the manufaturer covering is rear to avoid lawsuits) 
This lounger works great! We have a preemie and right now the Boppy is a little too big for our son. We just place him in the Newborn Lounger and he is comfy as he can be. It is safe place to put him versus putting him on the floor or couch. In about a few months he'll start using his Boppy but until then this product has been a lifesaver! What a great idea 
I bought this for my daughter when she was 8 months old and time to transition her into the "big" bathtub. I knew it was important for her to enjoy her bath and wanted to provide entertainment for her. This is a "must have" for every parent. It has strainers, a stringy sponge, and a "water faucet" that you squeeze to have the water flow. It is wonderful for her because she loves to figure out how things work. 
They seem to be keeping the seats clean, and in good condition, but only time will tell 
I am so glad that I am a member of Amazon.com The pack n' play sheets were no where to be found at any store. I then decided to check on Amazon.com. I was so happy that I found the sheets. I ordered four sheets, they are just the right size too. My grandbaby soon to be born will truly enjoy the pack n' play when the baby comes to visit. Thank you so much for having the sheets for me. I also want to say that I received the sheets in one and one-half days. The delivery was terrific. Sincerely, C. McCadde 
The sheets fit the pack 'n play pad well and do not slip off with a squirmy 5 month old 
These were the only sheets that I could find for my Pack 'N Play, and while they are a bit cheap looking, I find that they work just fine. They are pretty thin and they are not elasticized as the manufacturers claim they are on this site, but they function well enough. I live in the desert and my baby was born in August, so the thin (therefore cooler) construction of these sheets was a bonus. However, if you live in a colder place, you might want to try to come up with something a little cozier for your baby. On the whole though, these sheets are fine if you want something to cover the plastic mat of your Pack 'N Play 
This is a great product if you have a wiggly child. I wish I would have known about this sooner. At the grocery store I used to spend more time making my son sit down than shopping and it was very frustrating. After purchasing this product it has been less stressful at the store. This is a must have. The only challenge was connecting it to the cart but once that is accomplised it is worth every second!!! 
I can count on one hand the baby products that I would rave about... but this is one of them. I am not overly concerned about germs and my son never really chewed much on shopping cart handles - HOWEVER - he is a really SQUIRMY. We've had a terrible time getting him to sit forward and stay seated in a shopping cart. Which makes grocery shopping precarious. He is very quick to stand up and turn around in the cart if we take our eyes off him. I looked and looked for a five-point harness that I could use with a shopping cart and then stumbled across the Shop n' Dine at TJMaxx. IT WORKS WONDERS. He was so secure and comfortable. We never once had to sit him back down, turn him around, or anything. I also had a place for my own drink that was out of his reach (the cup holder on front held my fast-food super-size drink). My son never complained about the seat and I wish I had found this months earlier (he is 14 months now). It's perfect. One thing I found was that I was able to use the shopping cart strap in addition to the 5-point harness on this product which in effect made a 7-point harness (over the shoulders and between the legs with the product and around the chest with the shopping cart strap). Another thing - My son usually pulls shoulder straps off, but these stayed in place and he never messed with them. And even though he was straped in securely, he was comfortable and able to play with us, point to things, play with toys, etc. He wasn't at all paralyzed or completely immobilized by the straps. Both my husband and I were extremely impressed and pleased with the Shop n' Dine 
This head and body support is great for a newborn. Our baby always went sideways in her carseat with a regular head support. This one has both a head and body support, that are detachable w/ velcro. And, now that she's 3 months old, we can use just the head support. We also used it in her swing with the body support and now without. Overall, this is a great product and is soft fleece and easily washable. I will probably purchase this item as a newborn gift for the next baby in the family, as it is that great. 
We bought this for our 4 month old and she absolutely loved it! The toys are removable which is fantastic becasue I can take them along as "teethers', if you will and then connect them right back to the bouncer so she can play with them. As long as my baby is happy, I am happy, too! This bouncer is a definite hit in our house!!! Buy one, go for it 
My 8 week old loves this bouncer! and i like the recline feature alot.it inclubes two teething toys, which is great 
I bought one of these bouncers at Walmart for my daughter. She is a very fussy baby who cries WHENEVER she is awake. I placed her in the bouncer and she was content for once. I sat her in the upright position and she loved looking around and she fell asleep without crying, for the first time. The music is very cute. I always try to shop around for a cheap bouncer. This is my second bouncer I have owned. Both were the cheapest one I could find ($20). This $20 bouncer works just as good as an expensive one! Don't burn your money on those $40-$70 bouncers. This one is a good buy!!!! It's blue but my daughter looks so cute in it... so I would call it unisex. Try one out 
Great boppy cover! The color goes with practically any decor and it's super smooth and comfy 
I disagree with the reviewer that said this was of poor quality. It is a slipcover, similar to a pillow case - do pillow cases completely protect the pillow from drool and other things? Of course not. This takes the ordinary Boppy pillow and makes it a lot more comfy for mommy (or daddy) and baby. It is so soft and we love it!! Just throw it in the laundry when dirty and it'll come out like new 
I had this with my daughter, and it was very well made and did help, but I still felt like I was bending over to much to feed my baby. I gave it 4 stars because it could have been my fault with why it didnt work well for me. This time around I am using the best friend , the one that wraps around you so you can move and walk. A little more practical now that I have a toddler to run after 
This is a beautiful cover for the boppy pillow. So soft and luxurious feeling. I used it for several months without a spare and washed it every few days. And yet it is still in like-new condition! Wonderful item, now that I am expecting again, I am buying another one just like it. : 
I just love the texture of this pink boppy cover. It goes great with the Bare Naked Boppy Pillow. We've used this item countless times with our baby, and I cannot imagine living without it. The cover washes up really nice, and it does well to protect the pillow 
We bought this cover not too long ago and we love it! Yes, we can see the print through from our Boppy but we don't really care since it's nice and soft for our baby. It would be nice if it was thicker and covered the print. If you're looking for water proof than this isn't the way to go but if you're looking for something that's going to be soft and comfortable for baby I'd suggest one of these 
There's nothing fancy or complicated about this pump. It does exactly what its supposed to and nothing more. Its very easy to use and clean and its quite efficient. It is definitely not for full-time use as your hand will start to cramp up, but for moms who want to pump part-time, this is perfect. I thought the price was fair. Its also great that you can fit standard sized bottles onto the pump itself. Basically, there are no complaints here 
Unlike many of the reviewers, I exclusively pump--that is, my son only gets breast milk, but I do not nurse him. I have the hospital grade Medela pump, which is fantastic--I get plenty of milk without nursing, and am even able to pump extra to store. I bought this pump because I've run into trouble a couple times when I was away from the house for longer than expected. My regular pump has to be plugged in (it does not run on batteries) so it's hard to carry around. I bought this pump because it is easy to throw into the diaper bag in case of 1) engorgement or 2) needing a bottle while I'm out. Although I'm not a fan of handpumping and have not used other manual pumps, I've found this one easy to use. Basically it works just like like the hospital grade--and I get just as much milk, just as quickly, with this pump! The design is so comfortable that I have even pumped while driving home one day when I got stuck in major rush-hour traffic. Being able to use it left-handed or right-handed is a huge plus. I give it only four stars because the silicon part on the handle has a tendency to get loose and I lose suction in the middle of pumping. Note for Avent bottle users: You can buy, for about $10.00, a set of adaptors (I bought mine at Buy Buy Baby) that allow you to attach the wide Avent bottles right to this or any of the other similarly styled Medela pumps 
I purchased this pump with my second child after returning my Medela electric pump (I think it was a pump in style) to its original owner. I am staying at home with my child number 2 and only needed something for occasions. This pump seems to work great. It is obviously quiet and there is no hassle of the tubes, electrical outlet, etc. I did notice however that when used more frequently while trying to teach my 7 month old to take a bottle that it made my nipples soar. It could have just been me since I was not used to pumping that much. Other than that it is great and I plan to use it for a weekend away next month. I was concerned that my hands would get tired, but it is really easy to use! It is nice to be able to use discretely in the car as well. 
I had the original Pump in Style for my first two boys. Got rid of at after second baby Thought we were done. LOL another story. Anyway I bought the Harmony in case I needed to buy a Pump in Style again and could use the same sheild and bottles. I've had it in use for 3 months. Pump about 3 times a day. Just had surgery yesterday and had to kick up my supply so I had 10 feedings stockpiled, in addition to pump and dump for 24 hours straight afterwards. I bought two when pregnant because I wasn't sure how they would hold up. This little Harmony pump has held up great. I have only on in use. It's a breeze to clean and assemble. It's great in that I'm not tied to a machine and can move about the house. Highly recommend this little pumper 
This breat pump was a life saver. I have used when I was working part-time and even during full-time and the pump has never failed on me. Its easy to use, doesn't hurt at all, not to mention it was very fast. I remember pumping 10 onces in 10-12 minutes. The clean up was an absolute breeze and the best part was that I could fit in the pump in my little purse and no one would ever know. My daughter was used to Playtex bottles so I used the liners on the playtex one step storage system and attached it to the medela pump. This worked like a charm and didn't have to transfer milk from one bottle to another. This pump is worth every penny. 
I got this pump because I wasn't sure if I would need an electric as a stay-at-home mom. This pump is easy to use and clean. The ergonomic pump handle is pretty easy on the hands and wrist (I could pump even when I had tendonitis which hurt when I moved my thumb). It does not take up much room when disassembled so it'll be great for travelling. I'm not that thrilled about the soft comfort flange that is provided. I prefer the regular plastic Medela flanges that come with their electric pumps. I find that I can get as much milk out of this manual pump as I can with the Medela Pump In Style electric in about the same time and this one makes a lot less noise (great for middle of the night pumping sessions to ease engorgement without waking my baby and husband up). Also, just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily with my electric to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast). I use either my electric of my manual depending on my mood, whether I need to double pump, if I need my hands free (then I use the electric) or if I'm going to pump somewhere besides my bedroom (i.e. living room while watching tv with my husband). I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference. I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm. 
I didn't realise how awful my evenflo electric pump was 'til I used this one. Where the evenflo was painful and annoying to use, this little hand held manual pump is easy to use, painless because I control how hard and fast it pulls, does not sound like a dying cow (virtually silent), has less parts and does a MUCH better job. It feels very similar to my baby's suckling and as a result my milk will let down sometimes 3 times during a single pumping. :) To sum it up--It's fast, easy and effecient. I plan to take it with me in my diaper bag for whenever I need it. I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a breast pump. 
This is a great potty! No place for it to leak at, we had the Royal Potty but it leaked very badly. But this one is great! Plus it is cute!! 
and hopefully our last! Son liked it from the beginning. Although we haven't had success on it yet, it is comfortable enough and roomy enough that he can sit on it for a while to get used to it. 
With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money!! 
We initially bought a potty chair from a local store. Each and every time my son used it I had to take it apart and clean every crack and crevice. I read the reviews on this potty and am I glad!! We ordered it from Amazon and the day it arrived my husband called me to tell me it was the best purchase we had ever made!! It's simple two piece design make it a breeze to keep clean. With the first potty my son would end up going everywhere because the splashguard was not high enough. This potty chair is almost oblong in shape and it keeps everything where it should be. It it large enough for my avearage size 2 1/2 year old boy. This is worth every penny we spent on it 
This is the only potty chair my 2 year old Grandson will use. My daughter had to cart it back and forth to day care once a week. Before his visit from KS. to MA. I purchased this particular one. I lined up the new one and 2 other ones I had prior for his sister's potty training and he only used this new one. It is easy to clean also. It's on Grandma's favorite's list. Grandma from MASSACHUSETT 
This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy. 
As a "first time" mom of a 13 month old boy, these reviews have been so helpful! Not only do I know which potty seat works best for other little guys...but I also know the ones to run away from! Thank you Moms!!! 
This was truly a needed item in my home. I have twin boys and put it off for a while. It is a great purchase. I have two sets of stairs and this set my mind at ease. I also got the extension 
This is the best baby item I have purchased! I fit in it also, I can sit in the play gate and watch tv while my baby plays. He can't get to the tv or anything else and has so much room he does not now he is confined. It folds up in just a second and in the closet it goes. Also works for puppies, kittens and even baby goats! 
My wife and I got this for our new puppies inside the house. It works great both inside and out 
This gate has been a real life and time saver. I bought the extension for it and set it up in about 5 minutes. I set up all of my sons toys in it and let him go. I don't have to chase him around the house and I can get a lot done knowing where he's at. This gate is awesome 
We swaddled our daughter forever, it worked miracles for us and she loved it. I also was so much more comfortable and at ease knowing she was bundled up nice and warm at night. Then she got too old for it and I was so irritated to just leave her in the crib with no blankets or anything. Then I saw these and I tried them out and I love them. We bought the fleece ones and they keep her so warm. She can cuddle in them if she likes and be nice and warm like she used to be in the swaddle. She seems to like them. The bottom line is that her tummy, chest, and toes are kept warm in a safe way. I highly recommend these. The fleece ones are quite warm so if you live in a warmer climate I would recommend the cotton ones 
Sometimes at night it gets chilly and in just a sleeper my little girl's toes would be cold. Once I started using these her tootsies were always warm. She also started sleeping better through the night too. We get to cuddle up with a comforter at night but blankets aren't advised for infants... These are better than a blanket anyway 
Babies/children are always curious and don't like sleeping much since it reduces their "nosy" and/or get-into-trouble time. Our family love Sleepsacks and we consider them Volvos, because of their safety value:: (1) Reduces the possibility of SIDs - not necessary to have a quilt or blankets in the crib with your baby when he/she is in a sleepsack. (2) Soothes fussy babies - my nephews and nieces were always ready for Mr. Sandman as soon as they are in their sleepsacks - probably because of the "cocoon"-like feeling (so similar to their time in their mommy's womb). They can roll around (once they are older, of course) and still sleep through the night safely, so you can get some sleep too without worrying about potential dangers in the crib. Get 3 (2 small and 1 either Medium or Large) and you should be good to go. The newborn size is better suited for preemies. The choice for Medium or Large is negotiable because babies grow at different rates. 
We loved the sleepsack because it was our daughter's cue early on that it was time for bed and time for some serious sleeping. In the middle of her last nightime feeding, we would sack her up. We attribute the cues of the sleepsack to a great sleeper -- and one who slept through the night early! As she grew, we used them until she was a pretty quick crawler. For those who believe in the BabyWise series, this is very helpful in creating a sleep pattern. Warm and cozy too! (If only sleepsacks came in adult sizes! 
Love these SleepSacks! My son would constantly break out of the swaddle, so we tried these when it was getting ridiculous! He loved them and slept so much better. Now we can't live without them. I just put him in a long sleeve onesie and the sleepsack as our house is quite warm. He never complains and sleeps through the night. Am curious about the quilted ones. Could be a perfect mix of the cotton and the fleece (which can sometimes be a bit sweaty!) 
I love not having to worry about blankets in the crib when I put my son in his sleep sack. Middle of the night diaper changes are easy, too 
Had a few of these for my new daughter and just loved them! She hated being swaddled and prefered the freedom of something like this. Plus I never had to worry about her tangling in blankets when in the sleepsack. Also not too awful for late night diaper changes since it zips from the bottom 
Excellent product--couldn't wait to receive it, and it's been a joy to have it ever since 
Great item at a good price. It works perfectly and doesn't take up too much space even though it can handle plenty of items 
This is great to keep the baby things seperate from adult things. It organizes the different things the babies use and has a place for everything. It will grow with the baby so it is not just for bottles but is great for sippy cups. The only thing it lacks is a place for childrens plates but you can stand them up between the sippy cups and that works just fine. I love using it and wonder how I did without it. 
I wash all of my stuff either in the dishwasher or using a sterilizer. My only complaint is that it isn't bigger. My son goes through at least 7-8 bottles a day...and even though there are spots for 8 bottles...there isn't enough room for my other pieces and parts (we use Dr. Brown bottles). If you are a Dr. Brown bottle user, know that it works great for about 5 bottles...I put my tubes in the "basket" part...they stand up just fine. 
I used this stroller for the first time yesterday, and I can't say enough good things about it. I also have a Graco Quattro and a Macleran Volo, and the BOB is definitely the most versatile stroller of the three. I can steer it with one hand while handling my dog with the other hand. Jogging with the stroller is a breeze, as are the basic functions of the stroller. I assembled it with no problem, and it's very easy to fold and unfold. It weighs about the same as the Graco and stores similarly to the Graco. My son loved the Graco, but I found it hard to handle and I couldn't run with it. He hates the Volo b/c he can't sit up in it. Although the BOB is more similar to the Volo than the Graco as far as the seating position goes, my son doesn't seem to mind it. I think it supports him well. It has plenty of storage, and I also purchased the handle bar console. The orange color is nice, with a brown contrast. I live in Minnesota, and this thing plows through the snow without any problem. I'm very happy with this purchase. 
My almost two year loves his new bed. It was an easier transition from crib to toddler bed than I thought.He loves going to bed in his new "BIG BOY" bed. He likes looking at the face of the train bed as he touches the facial features. This is one of the best purchases I have made on-line thus far 
this bed is better than I hoped for! My son, at age 16 months decided to revolt against the crib, and opt for mommy and daddy's bed instead! We were very leery about putting him in a big boy bed at so early an age, and this bed seemed to be built the toughest and safest. The transition was amazingly better than I could have ever dreamed of! My son LOVES this bed and not only started sleeping through the night again, but naps in it as well! It is totally cute, and the design is such that even a tough tosser/turner as my son won't fall out - unless he wants to! Even then, it is low enough to the ground so no injury occurs. I HIGHLY recommend this bed 
It took one 2-year old supervisor and 3 adults to get this bed put together. This bed does not come with a support for the mattress. However, you can buy a piece of board that has material covering it at Toys R Us for $38. It's worth the money. Our son loves the bed. It's very sturdy. The headboard where you can store "books" is a little bit shaky but nobody is going to be sitting up there. He also loves the area where you can roll cars down. Mom likes it too. One area, the headboard, was horrible to put together because the plastic was not molded as well as it could have been. The headboard had four areas where you needed to push thru and then push it down to stay intake. We ended up using oil from the kitchen to get this accomplished like another reviewer had done 
We just received this today. It didn't take me too long to put it together by myself (hubby deployed). I had to secure my son in his sister's crib and couldn't find the proper screw driver but it can be put together with a common kitchen knife in about 45 minutes. The only problem I am having so far is the back keeps wanting to pop out as this is one of the snap in parts. My son, John, was so excited when he saw this and just loved playing in it the rest of the afternoon. He went to bed right away as he couldn't wait to get back in here. 
My husband and I battled between this bed and the nascar bed. I won of course and we ended up with this one. So far we are very happy with it. We bought it for our 22 month old son, who loves it. He stays in it at nap and bedtime, and plays on it during the day. My biggest frustration was putting the bed together. The very first step took us over two hours, plus we ended up having to run back to the store and switch one of the side rails out with the display model because it wasn't fitting together right. The second peice didnt fit much better and it even after we got it locked in to place the screw didn't line up. After that step asswmbly went really quick. It looks darling though and our son loves it which was all we were really hoping for. Stephanie Salt lake City, Ut 
All I can say is the bed is Quality, strong, and the kids will enjoy it. I didnt know the bed will be so big. This is worth your bucks. The kids actually feel like they are in a train 
great bed! although it doesn't have a support for the matteress we found that if you get the right one you dont really need it. my only problem was the assembly for the head board section could have been engineered a little better. and the caps for the screws dont quite fit perfect. 20 minutes to put together. my son just loves it though, if i could just get him to stay in it all night now 
My husband and I purchased the "Thomas" bed as a transitional bed for our little grandson who will be two on 3/25. He loves all the Thomas trains and now plays with them on the side rails of his bed. We purchased "Thomas" toddler size bedding and all the accessories for the bed and play areas. The bed uses a standard crib mattress but will need additional support as our grandson grows. If a child is a "bed-jumper" then the extra support will be needed prior to the first jump. This bed is sturdy made well... even for plastic! When Carl goes to bed we tell him that his bed is in "Tidmuth Shed" and that his Mama Daddy are close by. Thanks to Amazon BabiesRus for two years of timely deliveries and excellent products. 
We love this car seat it is super comfortable.. However I must say is is a bit large for our car, we have a VW passat. Our son loves it and falls asleep pretty quickly in it 
Both of our children have been in Marathons since they outgrew their infant carriers and we have been extremely happy with both seats. We have found them to be far more user-friendly than other seats we have used and even though our daughter is now able to use a booster seat, we continue to keep her in the Marathon. Convenience aside, mom ran a red light and t-boned a Montero last month. The Montero was totaled, our tank-like Range Rover sustained over $8K in damage. Our son was in his Marathon and when Mom turned around to make sure he was okay, he gave her a big toothy grin. Not one single peep or tear from the little guy! When insurance offered to replace the seats, we went straight back to the Marathon 
if you have a medium sized sedan....like a vw passat....expect to move the seat in front of the installed car seat way up.....i like the car seat....but it's extremely big for my car...you need to have an suv with a lot of back seat space or maybe even a mini van.....otherwise it's very cute 
I originally bought the Britax Boulevard for my son who is 2 and was out growing his regular convertable carseat. He is 35 pounds and needed a seat that would "fit" him. That seat was not so great. I sold it and bought this one instead. I bought the Zebra print. The seat is big and heavy, which I like since it looks and feels so safe. I like that the instructions are attached to the seat so you can't lose them. The seat was easy to adjust to fit my son and very very easy to install into my very small car (Suzuki Esteem). After installing it with seatbelt it DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL... which we all know is safe. Installation was so fast. I love the belt lock offs. The seat is very plush and soft. I love the many covers available. My son sits comfortably in this seat, there is plenty of room to grow, the crotch strap is so much better on this (than the Boulevard) and I am sure we are going to be able to use this seat for years to come. I am so glad I found this. Buy it, you will not be disappointed 
I bought this seat when my son was 8 months old as he was too big for his Graco sung ride. I have a 2005 Honda CRV. In the rear facing position the seat belt was not long enough to strap it to the seat. My SUV only has the LATCH system on the side seats and not the middle seat. I spoke to the car safety officier for the police department and he told me to place him in the side seat behind the passenger seat as this would be the safest place in regards to incidence of accidents since I could not use the middle position. The reason he told me not to use the LATCH in the middle position (by using the side seats LATCH system) since my SUV is not equipped with it is because the LATCH is connected to the car frame and if we were in an accident and the frame of the car bent it could tear his seat in pieces. I was not aware that the LATCH was connected to the frame. So the officier told me that when he is able to be forward facing I should be able to put him back in the middle seat as it shouldn't require so much length of the seatbelt. I love this seat and so does my son who is now 9 1/2 months. It is very soft and cushy. I probably wouldn't have bought the infant car seat if I was aware this seat could accomodate even a newborn. I would definately recommend this seat. It was very easy to install. It does not have a cup holder and that is the only thing I wish it had for when he is older 
Britax Marathon was the easy chioce for me. Excellent growth up to 49"-65 lbs as a 5-point harness. The seat was extremely easy to install with the latch system and versa tether strap. I especailly liked the head support on the side which is reassuring for side impacts. The marathon is well padded and my 7 month old Jack looks so comfy in his seat that I wanted to jump in there with him. There are better prices online as one amazon consumer stated in her review online about traveling tikes.com. They are selling the same marathon at $219.99 shipping and tax included. They had a great selection of patterns to choose from which made it easy for me to make my decision. Im one totally satisfied consumer! 
The Britax Marathon is wonderful. As a concerned parent I wanted a seat that would offer a 5-point harness for as long as possible. Thats where the Britax Marathon shines through all the other seats that I reviewed. The Marathon allows any child to remain in this seat up to 49" in length and or 65 lbs. Thats equivelent to a five your old. Not so happy with the color selection that Britax offers for a boy. (...) The seat arrived shortly thereafter and was nicely boxed. I did have difficulty finding the instructions that were tucked underneathe the front seat fabric which I thought was a strange place to put them. However the seat was extremely easy to install and did not take up much room in my VW Jetta. Wonderful Seat and price 
When my son was 5 months old, he was almost too tall for his infant carseat so my husband and I started looking for a seat that would last him until he was old enough to ride without one. Initially, I wanted the Britax, but I didn't know anyone who had one and I was really afraid to spend $300 (including tax) on a seat. So we bought the Eddie Bauer. I didn't hate it, it was ok, but it did NOT fit in our car (Toyota Rav-4). So we gave that seat to my mother so she could use it on occaision when she babysits and we bit the bullet and bought the Britax - OH MY GOSH. We love it! It installed in like 2 minutes, I'm not kidding. I could not BELIEVE how simple it was. My son (who is now 6 months) LOVES it - he is so comfy and he can sleep in it without his head leaning way over like it did in the Eddie Bauer. He never cries when he is in it - it sits up straight enough that he can look around which he also loves. The fabric feels so wonderful and wipes clean pretty easily. I love the one hand strap adjustment and the velcro that holds the straps out of the way for boarding. We're planning a plane trip in May, and I can tell you we'll be taking this seat. And when our next baby arrives, he or she will be riding in a Britax. They ROCK 
This chair is wonderful. It reclines for infants which is terrific. The pad of the chair is removable so it can be washed. The tray can be removed so you can set the child up to the table. There is also a place mat to be put on the tray that has numbers and pictures on one side and letters and pictures on the other side. My son has learned some of his letters and numbers by using this during dinner and lunch time. 
This is a great seat b/c the baby can just sit and hang out it in while it's reclined and as the kids get bigger it transforms to fit them. Our three year old uses it at the table without the tray. When he found out that the new baby was going to use it, he said, That's my seat! So, we bought a second one. Also, it doesn't take up as much room as a high chair and we've been know to take it to restaurants b/c it's so much more comfortable than those boxy high chairs. And we all know that a comfortable kid is more like to let you have a peaceful meal! A great product 
I'm a grandma and didn't want to have a high chair sitting in my kitchen when I only use it occasionally. This seat is great and a bargain. I like that it can fit on any chair and can be adjusted to different angles. The fabric cover is easy to wipe clean and the cushion provides sufficient padding. I considered one of the seats that slide over the counter or table, but decided on this one because I can have the baby facing me directly. This makes for easy feeding. I am very happy with the feeding seat 
It is so nice, and roomless! I love it Easy to clean I really love and great price too I really recommend this! 
This item is excellent for homes with limited space. There's no worries about where to keep a big, bulky high chair. I also like the fact that it's portable. Just toss it in the trunk and off to grandma's. It also grants you more options on where you feed the baby. You're not restricted to wherever the high chair will fit. I'm also a big fan of being able to get my money's worth out of an item. This chair really does grow with the baby and when he/she is too big to have the tray attached, just push it up the table and you have an instant booster seat. The quality of the chair is good and if used properly should give no trouble. The only problem I initally had with the chair was with the reclining feature. It was a bit stiff and difficult to move but after the first few times it no longer is an issue 
As the mother of twins, I didn't want the expense (or the clutter) of two conventional high-chairs. In both regards, these seats worked out nicely. They're not the fanciest high-chairs but the definitely get the job done and they're sturdy and easy to clean. We love them 
We bought this chair for my 3 year old son when he was born and we are still using it! So when my daughter was born 8 months ago we kept thinking that our son would be ready for a "big" chair. Well, he informed us that he was not giving up his chair so we had to buy another one for our daughter. I love how easy it is to clean, that it reclines, and that the tray is so easy to get on and off. Also, we don't have a lot of room in our house, so this just sits in one of our chairs and if we need to take it somewhere, we can do that too 
Great for keeping the sun out of my baby's eyes, and can be pulled down all the way for naps. It's very flexible. I use it on my safari tt stroller 
I am very pleased with this sun shade. When I first received it I thought I got scammed because it looks like nothing. But it does the job very effectively. It's super easy to attach and when not needed the shade pulls back out of the way. Depending on the angle of the sun, I can have it partially or fully extended. I've used ours for almost a year and it's held its shape. It also packs up very compactly for traveling. It's the best I've found for maximum sun coverage. It fits both my full size Evenflo travel system stroller and my lightweight Peg Aria, which has a very small canopy. On my recommendation my cousin got one and it works on her full size and her small Zooper also. I've read other reviews complaining it doesn't fit but I've tried it on many strollers of friends and it works. I think you just need to be creative in how you tie it to the stroller. I expect this shade will work on most strollers. I can see that some kids may dislike the reduced field of view when the shade is fully extended. I started using it when my daughter was only 3 months old so I think she got used to it. She's never had a problem with the reduced view. My cousin started using it recently on her 11 mos old and her baby doesn't fuss either. I now give this sun shade to every friend with young kids. It's a great and inexpensive shower gift. It's one of those things you can't live without once you have it 
When I first had my daughter, I was using clothespins and blankets to protect her from the sun. This shade has velcro fasteners that can attach to any part of your stroller to create any degree of shade you want. It is aslo very thin so it's breathable and it can really look like part of your stroller (at least more so than blankets and clothespins) I want another one so I don't have to keep switching it from stroller to stroller. 
I love this product, worth every penny. I tried the other kiddapotamus cover with the screen first and it did not work. This completely covers my 8 month old's face. The first day I tried it was a very windy sunny day, I had no problem with the shade moving or flipping up or down. I would recommend this to anyone, just wish I had this for my 3 year old son 
This is a great product and I'm glad I went ahead and bought it. I go jogging with my daughter nearly every day, so I needed something that would block the sun well. I had been using a light blanket and clothespins, but wouldn't you know, just as I got going at a good jogging pace, my daughter would remove a clothespin and the "shade" was no more. I was stopping to fix it more than I was actually jogging. With this sunshade, she can't undo it...although she tries! I can pull it all the way down (as low as I can on my particular jogger) and she can still see out but is shielded from the sun. I like the side pockets - great for keys and small items - and the velcro tabs are easy to use. The only drawback - and this is such a minor issue, probably hardly worth mentioning - is that the shade doesn't fold up all nice and compact like the instructions say. I wrestled with my shade for awhile before I finally got it folded up (it was a matter of "doggone it, this thing isn't going to get the best of me!")...and even then, it wasn't very stable. My suggestion - keep the little bag it comes in and semi-fold it and store it in that. All in all, this is worth it. Wish I'd had one when I started jogging with my daughter last year 
When our baby was first born it was fun to take pictures of him next to this inchworm because he was shorter than it. Now, at 5 months, he is longer than the inchworm and loves to roll over and "wrestle" with it. He is currently entertained by the various textures and fabrics on the inchworm, and I anticipate this being a toy that grows with him as he learns to make the music play, press the squeeky part, and learn his colors, numbers, and the measurement system! A very cool learning development toy 
My son has been wearing sleep sacks since he was 3 months old. Now at 13 months old, the XL size is perfect. It is nice and long and keeps him warm without having to worry about the loose blankets 
i love this product lets face it blankets,bumper pads,pillows and all deco in babys crib is NOT safe ilove the fact i can dress my baby in something that she loves and is SAFE and cozy she loves this when i put it on her she knows it is bed time and she starts rubbing her eyes and preparing to sleep please dont use blankets in babys crib its just NOT safe buy these they are GREAT!! 
These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it. When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters 
At 14 months my daughter, rolls all over the crib when sleeping at night. I can put this on and not have to worry about her getting cold at night. It also works great as a cue that it is time to go to bed. The nice light weight is great for spring and fall weather so I don't have to worry about her getting too hot. 
In this day and age of SIDS awareness, the Halo Sleepsack is a great product for babies who hate being swaddled. From day 1, our baby hated her arms being pinned and would wiggle and force her arms out from her swaddling. So the sleep sack has been a great alternative, warm and snuggly. I only wish that it had arms for those colder nights and that they weren't as expensive as they are 
We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics. They are all terrific. We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall. I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
We have used this since we quit swaddling him as a newborn. We use the cotton one year around and it is the perfect weight here in Texas. We only use the fleece one when it becomes really cold. He is 15 months old and he associates the sleepsack with sleepytime. I never have to worry about him being cold or kicking off his blankets-totally recommend!! 
I was very impressed when I received my bedding. The design and quality exceeded my expectations 
It's a great product for below $100 price range. Pros: It has almost all necessary features which other travel system has got. Low price. Cons: There is no suspension for front wheels 
Very reliable item I used for more then two years. I have been very happy with simplicity and ease of use. I am surprized to see this excellent product at such a low price. You can't go wrong..go for it 
I am a Child Care Provider and one of my clients came in with a Bundleme in her child's car seat and I thought what a great idea. I never saw one of those. So I went online and found them and low and behold I bought 3 because I have 3 babies. I am buying 3 more for the stroller I have. They are the best thing since the baby activity centers. Plus it makes an old 24 year old, 3 seater stroller seats, look new again. I couldn't beat the price on the Bundleme in any store near by so that's why I got them online, it was also free shipping. Alice Gess in Holyoke, M 
I am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the Toddler Bundle Me is too small for their children. Maybe these people received the Infant version instead of the Toddler version? I have a 13-month-old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles, and she's got plenty of room in this thing. We received the Infant Bundle Me as a shower gift, so I was eager to jump to the Toddler version. It's warm, fits her Jeep stroller perfectly, and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers. Very satisfied. 
Keeps my little one nice and warm in the cold weather. Great buy! Highly recommend 
It's nice and thick and keeps baby warm. The only thing I would like different is that the top is held in place with elastic and it would be better if it fitted more snug to the top so it wouldn'tg slide down. But would recommend this product to keep your toddler warm. 
I've been using the Big Bundle Me for my 28 month old since he was 16 months, and haven't had any trouble getting him to fit in it comfortably. In fact, he still has plenty of room that I expect to be using until he is at least 3 years old. We use it all the time when we go out, and he loves being in it. If your looking for an quick, convenient way to keep your child warm, this is it 
Interesting to read comments about frustrated parents who's children don't fit in the big bundle me. My 3 year old is average for his weight and height and fits perfectly inside the big bundle me. He was comfortable and it kept him very warm. I wonder if they received the wrong size because my son fits inside great. I love this product and would recommend it to all moms who want to make their lives easier and hassle free 
This blanket is great! Most meaningful to me is that it's waterproof, so even if the ground is wet, I'm not. It's pretty easy to spot clean with a wet wipe, but you can also put it in a commercial-sized washer (I've yet to do this). Folds compactly and has a carry strap. 
Parents, if you are going to purchase this item you will love to know that the Nuby sippy cups (w/the soft silicone sippy) are compatible with the avent nipples and nipple holder. I wish I would of known this sooner! I would of bought the nuby sippy cups sooner and not spend so much money on the bottles. I give the bottles 4 stars b/c they are durable but they are bulky. The nuby sippy cups are slimmer and hold 8 oz. My baby can't tell the difference! It's the Avent nipple on a slimmer, less expensive, bottle-cup! 
I've used this foldable seat for all 3 of my kids now (two girls and a boy). It's so nice to store in the diaper bag (The storage bag it came in has long since ripped so I store mine in a gallon size Ziploc bag) It goes EVERYWHERE. I put it in our swim bag when we go to the pool too - it's so nice to be able to put the kids on it and not have to balance them on the huge public toilets. They're more relaxed sitting by themselves too (which means a shorter wait in the bathroom). I've read the reviews of pinched bums and read them when I first bought this too - just be careful is all I can say. My kids never got pinched but then, I put them on carefully so that it doesn't happen. Just pay attention and the pros and convenience of this seat far outweigh the cons 
When I bought this, I got the "oh great...more stuff that won't ever get used will clutter up my house" look from my husband, which I reminded him of tonight. I did buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested in using any potty, so it did sit around for a while. But ever since she started using the potty (first hers, now ours w/ her seat), we have taken it with us everywhere. Not just for the sanitary reasons, but every bit as much for the size. We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents' houses or my husband's office potty which we're the only ones that use. The couple of times (tonight included) that we've forgotten it she had to go in public, it is a nightmare. First there's the layers of seat covers, then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol' opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn't end up right there. Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her. Yes, I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry I didn't have it down yet how it folded, but it was well worth it in my eyes. Bottom line- I love it, I highly recommend it, I would be totally lost without it. So worth three times (and more) what I paid for it 
I love this seat, it is easy to use and fabulous for those times where you don't want to balance your child on the edge of the potty. I bought one for myself and for my parents to use when they take my daughter places. She adores having her own "seat" 
my son is sort of a young potty trainer. He is doing great and we bought this seat to take with us. He has no problems with this seat...my only thought after getting wet this week is that I wish it had a splash guard! but I know that may be impossible for a folding potty seat. I bring along with me a splash guard from another toddler seat that is no good as a potty chair but Iatleast I can use the pieces!! I have had no problems with this seat on any toilet, I just line up the front of the seats and my son sits and goes 
This was great for tummy time for us! We started using it right away, both for tummy time and for just lying baby against. It really seemed to help our guy hold his head up and look about, by 3 or 4 months he was reaching for the toys while holding his head up. It was also handy for propping him in when he started sitting up, and I used it at about 6 months when we starting doing solid foods to prop him up on instead of a highchair. We totally got our money out of this item, it is packed up and ready for the next one 
This is a great take-off on the normal boppy (which is also a wonderful invention!). I like that it's smaller, which is better for propping baby up for tummy time. I also like that toys attach to the boppy. I usually add a few more links on, for variety ... but this is not necessary. Tummy time is such an important part of baby's day, especially because of doctors' suggestions of keeping baby on his back to sleep. This is a great way to keep tummy time easy and fun 
My mother in law gave us this boppy, and I am glad she did. It is easy to run out of new things to do with a young baby. So this is nice to pull out and put on the floor and let our little Tommy experience having a pillow under his chest. I also put him on his belly with nothing under it so that he can experiance that as well. This is interesting because of the bright colors and the toys attached . So far he isnt paying attention to the toys, but he is still only just learning to use his hands. So I am sure in the next couple months the toys will become more usefull. I like to place a brightlly colored book in front of him, he enjoys having something at his level to look at. He gets tired of laying on this pillow pretty fast, but our guy is supper picky and gets bored fast. Also it is small enough that it can be stored out of sight very easily. I think this makes a great addition to any collection 
This toy helps keep my little one busy during tummy time 
Some boppy pillows are a bit to big so this tummy time boppy is a great choice!! Highly recommend it 
This boppy makes tummy time easy and fun. The pillow is the right size for babies, and makes tummy time a no brainer 
I sure wish we had discovered this stuff with my fist child for his gassy belly issues because I think I would have a few less gray hairs and my husband would have a full head of hair if we had. But any how, here we are with our second son (who is currently three weeks old) and having to deal with the cranky gassy belly issues all over again. Thankfully my mom bought me some Gripe Water while she was out visiting us and I can't tell you how happy I am that she did. It has made a huge difference for my son. We give him a bit of this stuff and he calms down within about 15 minutes. This stuff really works and really helps. It is a must have 
I have been using Gripe water for my son since birth. He is almost three and it helps with stomach aches, teething, gas and even calming his temper tantrums. My Parents used this product with myself and my siblings 
This product is just that simple..... it does everything it claims to do. Our grandson is much more comfortable, so that means everybody else in the house is too. It's just so nice to find a product that does exactly what it's supposed to 
This product is really great. The combination of ginger (which helps with nausea) and fennel (which helps settle upset stomach) make it safe for children and they enjoy the taste. My son, who was a year when we started giving this to him, was constantly fussy, whether it was teething or sour tummy, or any number of other things, and ibuprophen and acetominophen weren't helping. Plus, there was a fear of giving him too much of those. This product helped calm him within 15 minutes and usually only gave it to him once a day, if even that. I highly recommend this product and only wish I had known about it when he was a baby, as it's been told to me that it helps with colic as well 
Our 6 week old daughter has had a hard time with gas and we tried everything we knew to do (different holds, burping, gas drops, etc.) and nothing seemed to help. One night we purchased Baby Bliss Gripe Water and even though I was skeptical that it would work, it worked within a couple of minutes. It's the only thing that seems to calm her down when she's extremely upset. Definitely worth paying the money when it makes your little one feel better 
Our baby doesn't get gassy too much (just a few times per month), but when he does, he straightens his legs and screams and nothing calms him. Except Gripe Water, of course! Within about 30 minutes of taking his dose he's over it and back to normal. I also feel much better about giving him this versus the other anti-gas medicine, which is actually a drug 
I love it! It definitely covers my playpen and the stroller very well! There are no bugs that have been able to penetrate it. The best part is that I can still see my little one, and she can see me, too! It is very compactable when not in use. VERY easy to use 
We love camping-- so this bug net was great for keeping over the pack and play while she slept, and also great for covering the stroller while out on walks in the woods. It's such a low price, absolutely worth it 
I purchased two other sleep positioners that didn't work until I came across this one. My daughter snuggles into this and sleeps so peacefully. I love that you can adjust this according to the baby's size, the sides of the positioner aren't velcro so they always stay in place. Highly recommended 
I ordered this bookcase by mistake, but I was pleasantly surprised when I put it together. Assembly was not difficult. This product is made better than some I have seen. This bookcase would be a great addition to a child's bedroom. It is large enough to hold a collection of favorite books 
I ordered this bookcase for our newborn's room - and its perfect! It is just the right height for a lamp on top - so we can read while sitting in our rocking chair. The only thing I didn't like is that the backing is flimsy board - but as the bookshelf is up against the wall it doesn't matter much. So far all the books we've gotten fit on the shelves also. I would recommend this low horizontal bookcase to anyone 
Our little one's head is on the small size and she's rapidly outgrowing the hat. The jacket fits fine - only fastens at the top. Cute and soft. Don't order it if your baby has an average or large sized head 
we bought one of these for my son and it a good gate in practical and economical and good to 
We love using our Co-Sleeper. We were not comfortable having our baby sleep across the room in a crib, and I was initially worried about having the baby sleep in our bed. The Co-Sleeper lets our baby sleep close enough that a paranoid mom like myself can hear him breathing in the night, and can reach him quickly when he wakes up. I also love that it is easy to pull him into our bed for nighttime feedings 
I used this co sleeper with my son up until he was 7 mos old. He is now 2 and we are expecting our second any day now. I can't wait to set it up. It was a lifesaver when I returned to work because my son nursed every 2 hours up until 6 mos old. I didn't have to get out of bed to feed him and it made him feel safe to be next to his mommy and daddy. The mattress they provide is too firm so I suggest you get a portable crib mattress that will fit. I haven't tried the one I got yet so I'm not sure which one is ideal. I personally didn't set it up so I can't relate to the concerns of others. My husband sets it up and takes it down which is not often. We use a second-hand playpen on trips. He hasn't complained about it. Maybe some sighs of frustration. Still well worth it 
my 8 mo. old loves this toy. It's a big, blue elephant that makes noise when you spin his tummy or his tail. The shapes are big colorful and they tumble out when you press his trunk or ears. She just loves it and I think it's the cutest shape sorter I've seen. It's just not very compact, but it is very cute 
We purchased this sorter for a 1 year old and her sister who is 3. Both children were immediatly interested in all this shape sorter has to offer. It's brightly colored parts, stackable shapes, tail that twists to make the belly turn, the flapping ears and the trunk that shoots out the shapes are very enjoyable to play with. Highly recommended! 
My twin toddlers love this potty chair so do I -- easy cleaning/dumping, sturdy for sitting standing. One minus -- my son likes to pull the cushion portion off of the seat(while he's sitting on it). Annoying. Behavior-wise, we're working on it, but I think the manufacturer could have made it a bit more difficult to remove 
great toilet trainer for my daughter, the handles help my daughter with her balance while on the potty and when uses the adult toilet 
This is a very convenient training potty to use and clean. The seat simply lifts off and the inside bowl lifts out to clean. My daughter is only a year old and I worried that it would be a bit big for her (she's also on the small side), but she seems fine on it. She will sit on it for a long time as long as I'm there playing with her. The seat is a pretty soft rubber. We haven't had problems with it sliding, tho she's not big enough to try to get on herself, she has successfully been able to get up by herself without any problems 
I purchased this potty strickly on the customer ratings and was not disappointed. It's very sturdy, enough so that even my husband can use it as a seat when sitting with our daughter. All parts are very easy to clean. I started her training at 15 months, just by keeping her potty in the bathroom and having her sit on it (with her clothes on) every time my husband or I went to the bathroom. She soon got the idea and was sitting on it without a diaper. Because it took so long for her to go, we used the entire unit, but it didn't take long until we started just carrying around the padded seat for her to use on the adult potty. PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WAS WORTH IT, EVEN IF WE'D ONLY GOTTEN THE PADDED SEAT. I bought a second seat from another manufacturer to keep in our other bathroom so we wouldn't have to go up and down stairs to fetch it every time she needed to go, but it isn't NEARLY as nice. The Primo seat isn't just a piece of plastic with a hole in the middle. It's thin and contoured to the shape of a little one's bottm. It fits snugly on the adult potty. It has rubber pads and plastic pegs on the underside to keep it from slipping when she sits down. I also like that either a boy or girl can use it, without extra parts to assemble or disassemble. There's a small rise in the front for boys, but it isn't so high that it gets in the way when the child sits down. Very sturdy, very easy to use and clean. Can't say enough about this product. 
This pad has performed as expected and the extra length on the sides makes it easier to tuck under the mattress to keep it from moving. However, the photo gives the impression of covering more of the bed than it truly does. Take the measurements seriously - don't rely on the photo. I needed to play with it to see where on the bed it would be the most effective 
This pad is great. My daughter is a bed wetter and I can sleep soundly when we travel to hotels or relatives houses because this really catches all her wetness and the bed stays dry! I really should order another one to keep around 
This is very simple to use and protects my daughter's bed. A great investment if you are in the early stages of potty training and your child hasn't mastered sleeping through the night or naps without having an accident. I highly recommend it 
We bought two of these for our toddler who was going to be on his "big boy" bed for the first time. I LOVE THEM!! They are so easy to change in the middle of the night when his diaper leaks and they have held up to numerous washings. They hold a ton of liquid and haven't leaked once. We'll be buying more for our older son who is going to try to make it through the night with no pull-up!! Great buy! 
I bought the Handy's Plus Pad because, while our son has been potty trained for nearly a year, he sleeps so soundly that he doesn't wake up all the time to go pee at night, and I've had it with changing the bed sheets everyother night! This pad is a great item, it's soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it's plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it's never leaked through. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it's tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I'm not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I'd gotten 2! 
The reviews are right. My four week old is captivated by this. I can put her in her crib awake and she goes to sleep. She used to cry. The only problem is I wish the timer was longer or even better noise activated. I have to go back in a turn it back on a few times, but I believe this one has one of the longer timers. If you are having a problem putting you child to bed. GO GET IT!! If it had a longer timer I would give it 5 Stars 
We bought the Rainforest Peek-A-Boo when we were on vacation because we forgot to bring our usual soother. The Rainforest Peek-A-Boo is great. Our 5 month old is fascinated by it. The soother does its job in terms of helping him to sleep. However, the timer feature could be improved. Our son falls asleep better with the light and sound. Unfortunately the longer, 18 minute, setting is with sound only. Overall the Fisher-Price Rainforest is a very good product that I would recommend 
I bought this for my baby when he was a month old. He is now 4 months old and loves it. I have never had to change the batteries yet. He doesnt pay much attention to the lights or movement so I just have it set to play the music and sounds. He is impossible to get to sleep without it. Even if I am staying somewhere else with him, this is a must pack! With it I can feed him, bathe him, and lay him down, push the button and leave the room. I rarely have to go back in and start it again he falls asleep to it so quickly. I only hope when he gets old enough to activate it himself that he doesnt stay awake just to watch it. 
This crib toy is great and our 4 week old son enjoys looking at the characters and listening to the soothing sounds. However, we have changed the batteries already twice and I really wish the music would play abit longer then what it does. Other then that I love how fisher price came out with the rainforest theme 
This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it. She's mezmerized by the lights and movement and will cry when it turns off (she's still too little to reset herself). The characters are cute, the waterfall is very calming (even my husband and I stare at it), and the music and noises are very nice and relaxing. I do think it has a few areas of improvement. 1) The straps are really hard to get on. 2)The timer is way too short - I am always having to reset it for my daughter 3)It would be nice if it could be positioned higher. The instructions say 7" between soother and mattress is necessary which means that it has to go on the head of the crib instead of the side until my baby is old enough where I reposition the height of the mattress. So, unless she is positioned sideways she really doesn't get to see it well. I really do like this item and it has been a lifesaver getting our little one to fall asleep in the crib (she's 10 weeks old now and has been using this for a month). I highly recommend it 
My baby girl loves this! It puts her right to sleep every time. The music on it is very soothing and fun to listen to. Highly recomended 
i had the ocean wonders soothers for my other three kids so now it was time for a change. very peaceful and finally something different to listen too :) I love the music lights and the waterfall is great too. My son seems to like it and he is very sensitive to anything that is too stimulatin 
My son was born 3 weeks early, and was on the small side @ 6lbs 18oz. This enveloped him very well, even the nurses thought it was a great product and should be required for all new babies. I love the material, and its ease of use 
I was able to take my little one out in the running stroller at 7 weeks using the Snuzzler. I stuck to smooth bike paths until she was about 4 months, but her little head didn't budge when she was laying on this thing. In fact, I think she slept better in the running stroller w/ the Snuzzler than at home! The two sides are convenient b/c you can just flip it over depending on the kind of weather you're having: fleece side to keep her warm and the other to keep her cool when it's already warm out. By 4 months, she didn't need it in the car seat or swing anymore, but it still seems comfy for her in the running stroller even now at 5 months 
The snuzzler provides excellent support for our little guy. As it is wintertime and cold here in Budapest, we've opted to use the Bundle me for our car seat. It's too bad that the Snuzzler doesn't have some kind of cover to go with it. Our Snuzzler still gets a lot of use in Fisher Price vibrating infant seat. Our baby seems quite comfortable and content when sitting in the Snuzzler. The $14.99 price on Amazon makes this a great deal 
We've used this inside our Graco Snug Ride car seat since bringing our daughter home from the hospital. It makes the car seat very cozy and helps hold her in place without slouching or dropping her head. It's very soft against her skin, too 
We live in Florida. It's almost July. Our newborn loves this thing. She is currently happier in her carseat with the snuzzler than anywhere. On one side is a cozy fleece--which would be great for cool weather, but not what we need. The reverse is a navy fabric, and it's plenty cozy. It supports her head, so her head is always upright, even on long tripsand it gently supports her back and arms. I rate this as a "must-have" 
Unlike the other reviews, I find these bags easy to use and convenient. The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump. The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose. The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside. I store the bags upright (just in case, although I've never had a leaky bag) in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us (the First Years brand). Once they are frozen, I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk. When I am ready to defrost, I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes, and them pour into bottles. My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding, but I really wanted her to have breastmilk. She is 2 1/2 months old now, and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old. I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively, so I pump about 5 times a day. I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week!!! I pump way more than she eats, so I have a lot of stored milk. Plently for when I go back to work and can't pump as often. Take it from someone who really knows. These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe. If they were, I wouldn't use them considering how often I need to use them. 
I'm very happy with this bag. It's not bulky, but has a lot of space for everything I need. It's very good quality 
I was six months pregnant with twins, had a broken leg and a not-quite three year old who figured out pretty quickly that he could outrun Mama. When he nearly ran into a parking lot, I bought this item because his safety is my number one concern. When my son started getting rowdy in a crowded public location, I was able to slip this harness on him very quickly and easily because of the strategically placed velcro. I anticipated some snide comments from passerbys, but did NOT expect my son to give me a baleful look and announce (loudly): "I NOT a puppy, Mama!" Needless to say, my son did not like it one bit but it was comfortable and doesn't restrict the arms. It's a very good product, but it requires practicing with your child before it will be effective because the velcro WILL give if you and your child try to go in opposite directions 
We saw someone using these and they appeared to be perfectly suited to keeping young children nearby without carrying them or strapping them into strollers. Kids and parents can all be happy. So we ordered 6: two for us (2 grandchildren) and 1 each for all the parents and other grandparents. 
The first few years of a baby's life is memorable.Safety is very important.Every home with kids should have these. Thank 
WE decided to use cloth diapers because it's SO much cheaper than disposables. The Prefolded diaper service diapers are definately the way to go too. I couldn't do it if I had to fuss with folding. Also - if you plan to cloth diaper - a MUST have is 4 - 6 diaper wraps (10$ for 2 @ BBrUs). They are like plastic pants only with waterproof and cloth covering. They also have velcro instead of pins. My hubby (who hates wrapping anything) LOVES and OFFERS to change our newborn's diapers since he can easily handle the velcro wraps. We did a diaper cleaning service for the first 2 months, and I clean them on my own since. IT's really not as difficult as everyone thinks it is. Plus it's great on the environment. I strongly recommend cloth diapers and wraps 
These are good sturdy cloth diapers, whether you use them as diapers or burp cloths. Absorbancy is quite good. I use both these, and the "Gerber prefolded with absorbant layer" diapers. The diaper service ones are not quite as good for two reasons-1.)They are difficult to pin, and work much better with the velcro closure diaper covers., and 2.) they take longer to dry in the drier, thus increasing laundering costs 
Gerber makes a quality prefolded cloth diaper. When folded in thirds, they fit nicely into diaperwraps. They are strong and cannot compare to any other cloth diaper I've seen. To make them last longer I only bleach them when they are soiled, not just wet. I have found that these diapers last through about four consecutive years of diapering 
Good strong cloth diapers. They stand up to the abuse of the machine very well. I only have two problems with them. They aren't very soft, and they are hard to pin. I added velcro to mine just to avoid having to fight with them and a nine month old. Aside from these little problems, they are good, absorbant diapers that I use daily on my baby 
These are absorbant diapers and they hold up to the regular abuse of washing over and over again. They need to be washed several times before they are soft. I do need to mention that if you choose to cloth diaper your baby, you might want to just use velcro covers first since the weave is very tight on this diaper. I used pins, at first, and got frustrated, because they wouldn't go through the diaper. After a few washings, the weave loosened a bit and I was able to pin them more easily 
The price is amazing and the product is just what you need if you have a non-stopping baby like mine. Safe belts, comfortable seat, easy to install, nice colors. Don't waste your money in 3-digit-price car seats. This seat is the real deal 
I did as much research as I could before purchasing two of these car seats for my grandson (one for my car and one for my daughter). This car seat always seemed to rank pretty well, and the price was affordable, so I bought it. My first impression of the car seat came when I lifted the box - it was so light! After weeks of hauling my steadily-growing big-for-his-age grandson in his infant seat, it was so nice to lift something that didn't feel like a cement brick. The straps were very easy to adjust for his comfort, and the bottom liner is going to be great for those oops. The seat is truly very easy to adjust, compared to others I looked at. And my grandson is very comfortable in it. It was a wonderful purchase for us, in every respect 
We bought the car seat for our granddaughter. It is a real bargain, very safe, functional for a good long time and attractive. The only downside was that it was a challenge to install it initially to fit our granddaughter. 
This is an excellent carseat for an equally great price. We bought two of these to use in our nanny's car for our 9-month old twins. The seats don't have a ton of padding but still look very comfortable and are easy to install and use. Very happy with this purchase 
We have not yet gotten this into the car as my grandson loves to sit in the seat. It is very roomy and he looks like a king in the chair. He is always smiling when we put him down in his seat and will sit there for a long time and even fall asleep there. It is his seat on the kitchen table and keeps him involved with everyone 
First of all, kudos to Amazon for having the carseat to my house in 2 days (with the Super Saver shipping, I might add). Secondly, I spent days, DAYS, looking for a new infant-toddler convertible seat. I have an 05 Trailblazer and was desparately looking for a narrow seat I could fit between 2 Graco TurboBooster seats. It's still a tight fit but it works. This was the narrowest seat I could find on the internet. The baby body pad definitely is a must since there is very little padding in the seat cover. It will work for a little while, but during the summer I'm sure the baby will not stand for that much cushion around her legs, as it will make her hot. I'll have to figure something else out at that point. The seat looks better than I expected and is about an inch less wide than the Titan. The Titan definitely doesn't work in between the two boosters. I can't see any use for the pillow, other than for looks. I'm very happy with my entire purchase 
I was very impressed with this seat. I got it on sale and was axpecting something cheap. I just needed something quickly for my ever growing twins. The fabric is very nice and the padding is adequate. I love the removable bottom liner. It came in handy when one of my guys got carsick on vacation. 
Our oldest child is ready to use a booster seat! I was tired of transferring the car seats from the Minivan to my WRX whenever I wanted to take our oldest with me in my car. So we bought this booter seat to stay in the WRX's trunk until needed. It works great! It is comfy for my daughter, light weight, and very easy to use. We were surprised, it is much bigger in real life that it looks in the photos, and on ours the colors are reversed. The dark blue fabric is in the center with the light blue on the outside. The cup holders are awesome and are better quality than you think 20 bux would get you. We are very impressed and will be buying another one as the other three kids grow out of their car seats! Also, this is one of the few boosters that qualifies for free shipping 
this is the third one of these we have had. Our daughter is 19 months old and we will be sorry when she out grows this product. It keeps her warm and cozy and can't come off during the night. She seems to really like it too 
I have been very pleased with all Halo SleepSack products. This product was great for warmer weather. We also have the fleece sacks that have been great for the colder temperatures. I like the reverse zippers, roomy bottom design, and the durability of the fabric wash after wash. The best part is the peace of mind they offer me so I don't worry about suffocation from loose blankets. 
My daughter loves her sleepsack. She's been sleeping in one since she stated turning over on her stomach and could not be swaddled anymore. We put her in a onesie underneath, when cooler will put something warmer on underneath. We've got 2 so there's always one clean. Worth the money 
I used the fleece sleepsacks in the winter but needed something lighter for spring and summer. These cotton sacks are great - no need for a blanket and hence no worries about the baby smothering herlself 
These are great, we actually have them in a couple different sizes so my son can grow into them. (NOTE: We got him the blue one, but they make you review them separately) Here's what I love: 1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm. 2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him. 3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack. Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy. I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready. 
I was using a blanket for my newborn and would wake up all night to make sure she hadn't kicked off the covers (or kicked it over her face). Since purchasing this, I don't worry about that at all. She stays warm all night. One recommendation...buy the cotton SleepSack. I had the fleece SleepSack first and it seemed to keep the baby too warm. The cotton is a tight-knit weave and feels warm enough...even for our cold Illinois winter nights. 
What is not to love about this? Perfect for baby! Since you cant use blankets in the crib, this is a perfect solution! Soft, comfortable, and a thoughtful backwards zipper! 
My son was born July 04 and I usually keep my house very cold! I noticed that when I put him in the crib swaddled up in a blanket and came in minutes later to check on him, he had some how squirmed his way out of the blanket and was cold! Being my first child, I freaked! So we went on a trip to Babies R Us (because every mother (and you know what I'm talking about), will do anything just to go back to that store) and I found this item. I only bought one to try out and had to go back for at least 3 more. They are great!!! They have a light one for the summer and you can buy thicker one for the winter.. My son wore this at bed till he was at least 8 months old and he wore a long sleeve onsie underneath to keep his arms warm! You can't go wrong with this,,, I promise you!!!!! You will no longer have to worry about your baby getting out of their covers and getting cold 
We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too. I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all. I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23" has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need. I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves. This cotton is so nice and light that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together. If you want one that is heavier, they come in fleece and quilted also, but remember that there are no sleeves. I very much like that the zipper is "upside down". It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin. BTW, if you try to put your baby's arms inside the sack instead of out the holes they will probably get them out the holes themselves - mine did. 
I started out with various brands of bottles when my baby was born. My baby developed colic at about 5 weeks old. I wanted a bottle that prevented air bubbles as least as possible. The avent bottles were okay, but I tried Dr. Brown's bottles. You see the results immediately! You will see absolutely NO air bubbles going into the nipple or even in the bottle. No other bottle I've seen compares. As a result, my colicky baby has less gas and stomach pain. As far as the extra time to clean the gadgets, oh please, no big deal! It's a matter of an extra minute of your day for a few bottles. It's a little strange at 1st (all the gadgets), but in no time it's no big deal I PROMISE! I will always HIGHLY recommend Dr. Brown's bottles! 
THESE ARE THE GREATEST BOTTLES EVER. I HAVE A BABY WITH COLIC. I HAVE TRIED EVERY BOTTLE OUT THERE. THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST 
After having tried every bottle brand we could find, we ended up preferring the Dr. Brown's. They definitely reduced the amount of gas our baby was swallowing thus reducing the amount of spit up and burps. The measurements on the bottles are spot on, thus mixing formula in them is really easy. The bottles are very durable as are the nipples. They take a beating and still look brand new, including the measurement markings. I'm fairly certain the bottles we have will last until our baby is eating just solid food.  And yeah, the parts are a pain to clean. But we can live with that. It's not a huge, huge deal. I will say that the Playtex disposables were just as good in terms of gas prevention, but we didn't feel good about throwing away all those plastic containers and the added cost of purchasing them. As well, the measurements on them were wildly inaccurate and thus totally useless 
These are GREAT bottles! I have these and some Medela bottles that came with my breast pump. Dr. Browns wins -- no doubt about it! I guess I'm not as meticulous as some other reviewers on cleaning and sterilizing... I just follow the directions in the package and sterlized when I started out and then I've hand washed ever since. Now, let's face it, washing bottles is a pain regardless. Washing a few more parts is no big deal. It takes me approx. 30 seconds more to do the vent parts. And it's definitely worth the effort. The couple of times I've used the Medela bottles I could visibly see bubbles coming through the milk and rising to the top. Later my baby had lots of gas and spit up. With the Dr Browns bottles that NEVER happens. I don't even use the Medelas as backup "emergency" bottles anymore. I only use them to hold water if I'm taking a trip and need to bring some clean water from home to mix formula. The Dr Browns bottles are a godsend 
I must agree that I tried the others - from cheap to expensive - before finally getting to the Dr.Brown bottles. I tried others that had the same claims - even a few gimmicks that would work in theory (VentAire). I have only found success with the Dr.Brown bottles. These bottles will sometimes leak - until you get the hang of them and keep the inner-tube empty and the collar on not-so-tight. Usually a gentle twist of the collar will empty the inner-tube and then you can twist it back on...but not too tight. The disks help stop leaks during travel, but you really just need to work on keeping them upright. Yes, more cleaning - and thank goodness for microwave sterilizers. I simply handwashed and then boiled for the first child, but love my microwave steamer now. The markings are fading on some of my bottles, but I believe that hand-washing has saved them a little. I compared to Avent (which were only slightly cheaper - but had lots of "transition to sippy cup" type of advantages (or breast pump straight to bottle). I still love my Doc Brown's and the complaints of scratched off markings applied to the other bottles, too. I personally preferred the wide-neck because they seem to fit my baby better, but several friends like the standard. We all agree that the Doc Brown's are lifesavers, though. I give a 3 pk of the 8 oz size at every baby shower 
My daughter received this for a shower gift. She takes it everywhere! She loves it. It is light and easy to fold up. Her son falls asleep in it quickly. What a nice gift! Now with the price at $19.00 each and free shipping with $25.00 purchase, I just ordered 2 for gifts 
I bought this swing for my granddaughter. It is very easy to get her in and out of. She enjoys it. It does make a soft clicking sound similiar to the ticking of a clock. I think it was a good deal for the price 
This is the greatest product. They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to, are lightweight, easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at. Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says "Elmo, Elmo, Elmo". They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple. I wouldn't do without them, they are great 
Great product if you spend a lot of time out of the house - eating out, shopping or just not feeding your baby home all the time. Almost germ free way to feed your baby anywhere and then just have it disposed of and go. 
This is one of the best products on the market!! They keep my 1 year old occupied at the dinner table (he loves looking at the pictures of the Sesame Street Characters) and I love the fact that he isn't eating directly off of a restaurant table. I keep them in my diaper bag so they are always available. They are super easy to attach and stay in place. Finally a baby product that is useful, practicle, and reasonably priced!! 
Love this product. It's easy to use, easy to take along, clean up is a cinch. No worries about what's on the table UNDER the topper. We've had three restaurant employess (different restaurants) ask about the product for their customers with little ones 
These Table Toppers are the greatest for your baby that is eating table foods! You never know what those tables were cleaned with when you go to a resturant. You can stick the table topper on the table and place your child's food on top for your child and you will KNOW that it is safe and germ free. My 4 yr old and 3 yr old also love these place mats! I am so thankful my kids can eat without me worrying about germs 
I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on. I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean 
This system is great. Have only used it for 2 months now but its fantastic. Fits into our CRV perfectly. Its not as heavey as some of the others and very safe. We used it for several airline trips so far and the car seat fits great on plane. I would recommend to anyone 
I put this stroller system on my registry and we've been using it since my son was born last year. He is now 11 months and still fits in the infant carrier. We like that the carrier can be used in multiple cars so we bought an extra base. The stroller height seems great for my husband (6'2") and for me (5'8"). We don't feel like we are hunched over when pushing it. The stroller seems like it folds very compactly, but it still doesn't fit into my VW Cabrio trunk (the trunk opening is just a bit small). So we use it with my husband's car and we are thinking about getting a compact stroller that will fit in my car. My major complaint is with using the stroller without the infant carrier. Now that my son is older and wants to see everything around him, he doesn't like to recline. The back is adjustable, but we can't get it to be fully upright, so he is always at a 20 degree angle recline. He has started pulling himself forward and leaning on the tray. It is OK for now, but I think he'll start to get annoyed and tired when sitting forward like this. Overall I would recommend this stroller system 
We've been using this stroller for our baby girl for abt 2 weeks now and this is just a perfect stroller. Its got good grip and wheels are big so moves nicely. Car-seat goes in and comes out in a snap. Folding this stroller is easy - cant say it can be done with one hand but doesnt take much effort and you dont have to sweat it out while closing/opening. Has canopy on Car-seat as well as the main stroller, together both give a complete cover from rain/wind. 
My Husband and I are expecting our first child, a little girl, in July. We received this as an early shower gift from my grandmother and absolutely could not have asked for a better gift. It rides smoothly - everything is very easy to snap together and it's not complicated to figure out. There was minimal assembly which my husband did for me and he had a blast testing it out around our dining room! &lt;br /&gt; It's a great system - we think everyone will love it. 
This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free. 
Purchased for the upstairs nursery, it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night/early morning feedings. Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles. I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior's food (repels the condensation). I'd give it five stars, but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user - note to Munchkin. Worth every penny 
I love this bottle baby food warmer- it took a couple tries to figure out how much water to put in--but it works like a charm!! I'm not using baby food yet but it will probably work just as good 
1. You can't beat the price...EXCELLENT! 2. Easy to use. 3. Doesn't take up much space. I've even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well. 4. Great for warming food bottles. Suggestions: 1. Only use distilled water in it...works much better. 2. For cleaning: Once a month use a mixture of half distilled water white vinegar (about 2 oz. total) pour it in the warmer and turn it on. Doesn't smell great, but works FANTASTICALLY!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! P.S. I've been using this product for 6+ months now. 
After doing research, I picked Munchkin bottle warmer. Good things about this warmer are quick, enough heat, good size (we use Avent bottle),easy care and best thing is auto shut off. We has been using for 4 months day and night without any problem. People compliant about water adjustment, I usually use low level, my son never compliant 
I love this stroller. I would recommend it to anyone. My son has high tone and would arch really bad in regular umbrella strollers, because it only buckled around his waist and the fabric was not very sturdy. This one has the 5 point harness, and a heavy material that keeps him from arching. It is also taller than most umbrella strollers so you do not have to break your back pushing it. I absolutely LOVE IT. 
Very satisfied with this stroller. I was shocked at just how lightweight it really is. It folds up easy with only the use of your foot to release the locking mechanism below. My daughter likes to sit up, but I also can recline it for a quick snooze. Easy to maneuver in stores and seemed fairly smooth on uneven surfaces. Very happy after going through more than 3 umbrella strollers I returned in the stores due to one problem or another. 
I have used the stroller only a couple of times to try it out, as my grandaughter is still too young for it. I like the item very much. Ii is well designed, light, yet sturdy. I'm satisfied with the quality of the product and look forward to use it a lot soon 
I was on the market for a nice umbrella stroller. I have shopped around and asked other moms what they like. This stroller is very light and pushes SO easily! So many of the expensive ones have bad reviews on that.... the reclining position is a plus as well! 
After going through MANY strollers, this stroller definitely gets my vote. It's lightweight, compact, and has lots of features that a bulky stroller has. The handles are long so I don't have to hunch over anymore as I did with my umbrella stroller. The recline feature is also good. It allows my son to sleep comfortably rather than falling to the front while asleep. The basket is also nice. The only reason I gave it 4 star because sometimes the wheels tend to get twisted around and get stuck while being on rough sidewalks. Other than that, I really like this stroller 
This is the lightest easiest stroller. It's small enough to stash in the trunk and still be able to buy groceries. If my son decides he doesn't want to ride in it, it's light enough to fold up and carry on my shoulder. I like that there is a sun shade and I love the 5-point harness, I have used the rain bonnet once in a marathon, I was the only one without a wet kid. The seat also is angled towards the back so the child doesn't slide right out when you release the buckes like some strollers. Has zippers on both sides to recline for sleeping. It does make for a slightly reclined chair, but he doesn't mind. Very well made and sturdy, mine has been through a lot. I have owned it for about 1 1/2 years with no problems 
This swing is wonderful for my 1 month old girl. She likes being in the horizontal position so the way the swing is designed is perfect for her. although, I do think that the swing should be adjustable so she can sit more upright in the future. The size is fantastic! I have a very small house so I couldn't get one of the mongo designs. Plus, It is very easy to move room to room. The mobile is very interesting to her and is positioned in the perfect distance and position for a newborn. I can see it beeing a problem though in the future when she gets bigger and more mobile, because it is so close to the cradle. I would deffinitly reccomend this swing for newborns, but not so much for the older, larger bab 
I bought this tub for my 7 month old daughter, who out grew her infant tub. It is very nice. It has just enough room for her to play with her toys, but still small enough to be safe. It blows up just like a pool ( very easily ). I also use this at my mother's home, where she has a tubless showers, and it works extremely well!! I suggust buying tub grips when you get it. Overall, excellent. : 
This tub is great if you dont want to confine your child too much in a full sized bathtub, but is also small enough to keep it safe for baby. Since it's a blow up tub, all the sides are soft so baby wont bonk her head. There is a drain hole at one end for easy draining, and a suction cup underneath so you can hang it up when not in use. It is also good if you are going on a trip and are not sure if there will be a tub to give baby a bath in 
My baby really like the nipple size and they are a breeze to clean. Nice wide opening and the capped nipples are great for the diaper bag. We did notice leaks but once we replaced the nipples it stopped. I found that the nipples should be replaced every 30 days or so. Pricey? Yes, but ease of cleanup and mixing makes up for it 
I prefer the Avent bottles over the Playtex Ventaire brand. They both worked well and have advantages over one another. This is my non scientific review. Head to head comparison: Criteria_____________Comment 1.Bottle Material______Avent stays clearer and is more dense. 2.Bottle Design_______Playtex curve shape is innovative. 3.Nipple Design_______Baby likes the Avent shape better. Avent nipple size is labeled more visibly. The Avent recommended flow rate by age fits my baby more. 4.Vent system________Both work well. No difference. 5.Assembly Ease______Avent has less parts, but the nipple is harder to assemble. Avent recommends wetting the nipple before assembly. Slight advantage to Playtex. 6.Cleanning Ease______Avent has less parts. This is a big timesaver for me. Playtex has 2 more parts to clean. It's a hassle if you are cleaning a lot of them. 7.Overall Quality______Avent bottle seems better constructed. I'm not saying Avent is better than Playtex. I just prefer Avent more. because it fits my baby and my needs better 
I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words "Extra Soft" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned. 
I like the avent bottles a lot... the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in, without getting it all over the counter. I don't think these bottles seem to help my son with gas, he's just a baby, and they are generally gassy. The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first. Overall I've been pretty happy with them though, I've never contempated switching. **I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles... My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz, so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles, we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle. I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz 
These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again. Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks 
These are the only bottles that our daughter will use. I really love them, but wish they weren't so wide as it is so hard to get her to hold them herself now that she's old enough to try. I do have a problem with leaking occasionally when I've shaken the bottle to mix milk around. 
This was a very easy assembly and worked well with my 2.5 yr old grandson. No falling from bed during sleep. He did, however, deliberately find his way out of the bed between the rail and the foot of the bed The bedrail stores well and will be used over the next several years. We found this a safe product and are pleased with this purchase 
This works great on our huge king size bed that has a really thick mattress. It also works well with no bed frame. You just shove the horizontal legs in between the mattress and foundation boxes (or box springs) and it stays in place nicely. Easy to add and take away and looks clean and streamlined. Gives me piece of mind at night that my 10 month old baby won't be able to roll out of bed. In the morning when he wakes though he stands up and shakes it so I have to get up right away and pick him up before he throws himself over the top of it. It only works while the baby is sleeping but I don't think many potential buyers would expect more out of it anyway. It's great- highly recommend 
My baby is now 3 weeks old, and this is his favorite chair. It is actually doubling as his bed right now, because it is the only thing I can use to get him to sleep more than an hour at a time! I guess it can be a little loud, but I think that's what keeps baby sleeping! Love it 
This was a lifesaver for our premature baby girl! The fabric is soft and she seemed so comfortable in it when she first came home. She is now three months old and would rather swing or play in her gym but for the first month she put her glider to good use. So even though we didn't use it for a long time period, it did a great job of soothing her and I am glad that I bought it right here from Amazon with free super saver shipping! 
This Soothing Motions Glider is the best thing I have ever bought for my Child Day Care Business. I say anyone with an infant would enjoy this. It is easy to take apart and clean, it is quiet, it is wonderful! I can't say how long you will be able to use it...I have one very large 9 month old that is too big for it, and I have a 2 month old and a 6 month old who love it. The mobile above it is easy for them to reach, the music is soothing. I just works great. I wish I had one when my children were young 
I think the Soothing Motions Glider is a great product. My 6 week old daughter loves it, and she has slept many hours in it so far. It is very soothing to her. However, there doesn't seem to be much difference in the two speeds, and the noise can get a bit annoying. I can't say much for the music - I wish it was a bit more soothing for her. Regardless, she seems to love it. We have to put it on our coffee table so that our dog doesn't lick her to pieces ;) It's a very stable product 
I love this glider!!! My son is now 2 1/2 months old, and it's the only place he will sleep. He has reflux and Laryngomalacia and the way this glider has him slightly elevated is great for him!! This glider has served as a co-sleeper for us (our bed is low). This is my third child, and although I also have the Fisher Price Aquariaum Cradle swing, I use the glider in my bedroom as his "crib". I love this product. 
this glider was a gift I purchases for my daughters 3rd son and she really loves the glider her other sons are 10 and 8 and this was not available when my other grandsons were small ,the baby sleeps well in it during the day and I found the best price for the glider on AMAZO 
Haven't had the baby yet, but have played with this. Is is easy to set up. It does make a noise but a low mechanical noise, which may be soothing to baby. I'm not sure if it is suppose to make that kind of noise. It is not as noticable with the music going. It moves steady and slow. I think baby will like it, I hope. I rated it 4 because of the noise 
I used this product when my son was young (under 6 months) and found it a welcome relief from unwrapping and re-wrapping him in blankets when he needed changes in the night (it was turning into something akin to an all-night burrito stand!). I also bought one for my nephew. It was ideal for him because he has a clubbed foot and regular footed sleepers would not fit!!! 
I have been using these since my son was born and now he is 2. I will keep using them until he outgrows all of the sizes! They are fantastic! 
We went from a swaddle blanket to these sleep sacks. My daughter loves them. She still doesn't know how to use a blanket but doesn't need one with the sleep sack. I can't find XL in the stores - only online. I don't know what to do when she outgrows the XL... 
These are great! I love that I don't have to worry that my baby's going to kick off the covers and freeze in the early hours. My note on sizes, though: Length is often more important than weight. My daughter only weighs 22 pounds, but she's 32 inches long, and she's outgrown the Large, so I'm buying her the X-Large. 
We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics. They are all terrific. We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall. I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
Our first son slept with us and we learned from that mistake with our second. Our second son is sleeping in his crib throughout the night but I wanted him to be warm but most importantly safe. When he sleeps at night with his sleepsack, we feel at ease. I highly recommend this product 
After losing one daughter to SIDS, I now worry about everything. These blankets help ease my mind. I have never liked the idea of receiving blankets because a baby can easily move her hands and pull the blank over her head. The blankets provide warmth without the risk of going over her head. I usually put my daughter in her p.j.s and the in the blanket, but on really warm nights I just put her in this. Plus with it being a sack it allows her to move her feet around freely, which isn't the case when she wears feet p.j.s because with all her kicking her legs either get caught up in the croch area or the p.j.s get twisted around. Another benefit is that this is the only product to have the seal of approval from the National SIDS Alliance. 
We picked this up for our 4 month old, and so far she seems very happy. Sleeps soundly all night, and the mattress is firm enough that I'm not waking up every five minutes worried about SIDS. Read several baby-gear buying guides that said a mid-range mattress from a well-known manufacturer was the way to go, and so far I'd agree with them 
I originally purchased the sealy baby soft with only 80 gauge coils and it literally folded in half, needless to say it was junk. I took it back and bought this mattress, much better and safely firm and my daughter sleeps great on it. Next time I will do my homework. 
We recently purchased this mattress for the 3n1 Natural Crib. No problems noted with the mattress; however, our son (who is now 6 weeks old) doesn't sleep in the crib much just yet.. 
This is a very nice mattress and seems very firm, which is good for baby. However, the vinyl covering is in a blue and white check, which can be seen through the sheets. This feature is not readily visable in the product photograph unless you select the other pictures feature. Also, there is a small tear in the binding along the edge of the mattress. Our first mattress was white, and therefore there is not a pattern to be seen through the sheets. A good solution will be to use a mattress pad 
I have been very happy with this mattress. After researching Baby Bargains, Consumer Reports and reading all the online reviews I decided on this one. Good quality but best of all a perfect fit for the delta luv jenny lind crib. Mattress is firm and has the recommended coil number. Do your homework and you will find yourself coming back to this mattress. 
Bought this about a month ago for my Baby Girl. She is 5 months old now and doing much better sleeping with this product. I also feel more comfortable knowing she is elevated slightly at night time. This product does exactly what it says it does. Worth every penny! Mr. Mom 
We purchased the new Graco "hands free" diaper pail after our 4th child was born hoping that it would hold in the odor like our Diaper Genie did, unfortunately we wasted $49. We used the Diaper Genie on our first 3 children, after sampling others, and have always come back to the Diaper Genie. It is the best in keeping odors in, just make sure you change it regularly and you'll love it. The Diaper Genie II is better than the "twist away" style too. I would difinitely recommend this product 
The Diaper Genie II works phenomenally. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby or is expecting. It is easy to use, sturdy, and does exactly what it says it can; it locks in odors and keeps your house from smelling like a used diaper. 
We'd been using a covered garbage can, but every time it was opened to deposit another diaper it would take time for the terrible smell to dissipate. With this device, open or closed, we don't smell ANYTHING!!!! We couldn't be more pleased with this product 
Excellent item, and well priced. Pretty much like the Safety 1st "Neat" diaper disposal system, but with some improvements. We got this b/c the Safety 1st one was discontinued and we can no longer get refill rings for ours 
My old Diaper Champ stunk to high heaven. I bought a Diaper Genie II and IT WORKS GREAT. The only real downside is the liners don't hold much and they're expensive ($6 each which adds up) 
This is by far the best diaper disposal system out there. I have newborn and empty the unit about every 5 days, and it is absolutely odorless. The trick is to wrap your diapers tightly and kust push the diaper through one clamp single handedly. A++ 
Experienced the original Diaper Genie with my baby niece about 2 years ago, was a royal pain this bottom to load with diapers and to change out the liners. And it seemed like the liner needed replacing every couple of days, probably due to the "twisting" sausage effect. I received this new Diaper Genie II as a gift for my newborn, and WOW. It is truly easy to load the liner, and I used it from last Wednesday through this Tuesday before needing to empty it. Emptying it was as easy as advertised, I slipped the liner through the cutter and tied off the top of the dirties and tied the bottom of the liner where we were starting over again. At first, it took two hands to un-snap the lid and get it open because it was new, now after a week it has been adequately broken in, and it truly is a one-handed operation. Even though baby is a newborn, she's been producing some MASSIVELY stinky diapers. Prior to receiving the Genie II, we were using a regular trashcan. The Genie II has completely contained the smell since it has been in use, and my nursery is now blessedly odorless! The liner situation is great. Diapers do not come in contact with the actual container which is extremely sanitary, LOVE IT! Also, it seems that you can safely stuff a LOT of diapers into each load which is great. Bottom line, I give my highest recommendation for this product, 5 stars PLUS!! This will be my signature shower gift to others from now on unless I get beaten to it 
I love the new and improved Diaper Genie!! Our original Genie was constantly in need of a new film canister, and couldn't keep up with the smell of my two babies diapers (3 months and 2 years old). The Genie II, on the other hand, has had NO ODOR since day one!! The film also seems to last longer, since there is no wasting it by "twisting" a chunk of film with each diaper. This produuct is much easier and effective than the original Genie, and I absolutely suggest it to all of my friends!! FINALLY!! A diaper pail that actually works! 
My 4 month old loves to suck on her Baby Bjorn and this bib has really been nice. I just throw the bib in the wash and my Baby Bjorn is without all the baby drool. BRU where I live doesn't carry it so I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I didn't even know these bibs existed until I saw another baby in chewing on her Baby Bijorn with one of these bibs on. When I ordered this I thought I was getting one bib, but they are in a 2-pack. 
I am not sure at what point I had read that these mats are not a good thing... Heard they prevent the seat belt tensioner from working properly. But did a lot of research about the Grip It and also it was recommended at a local baby store that is highly regarded. We installed our car seat base and had more than the allowed 1 inch of movement, so the store recommended this - it did eliminate the movement. As far preventing seat damage, that wasn't one of our goals (though that is often one of the pitch lines for these items) 
Well the main reason I bought this swing is because it plugged into the wall instead of consuming massive amounts of batteries. However my son doesn't really like to swing in it yet he just likes to sit there and not move. But overall it's a good swing. The only reason I gave it four stars is because when it is in motion it only seems to move at one speed regardless of what speed it's set on. Great product though 
How much can you write about a high chair? My daughter fits in the seat. It looks comfortable, though I haven't tried it myself yet. The tray goes on and off fairly easy with one hand. Looking at the hardware though doesn't give me much confidence this will last more than one child. The tray insert works well and makes clean up much easier. Would be nice if they included 2 inserts, but I guess just having one makes sure I clean it sooner. My daughter loves the toy that attaches to the tray. It really helps keep her amused while we prep her food and she goes out of her way to hunt it down when she's just playing and not in the seat. Assembly was fairly easy and the instructions were clear. I was amazed they were able to break this down into as many parts as they did. If you liked Erector Sets as a kid you'll like putting this together. It took about 30 minutes and hardly any foul language 
This is a great product and purchasing it at Amazon was a great deal. Not only was it the lowest price that I found, but I got free shipping and I had it in my hand within 3 days. It came in about a million pieces so it does take a little time to set up, but the instructions were clear and I found it to be relatively easy to put together. The vinyl seat and removable tray make clean up a snap too. The real critic was my daughter who is VERY particular about her toys, and she loves it. She likes to turn herself around to look at the design on the seat cover, and she is thoroughly entertained by the jungle toy. My one word of caution....beware "tomatoe sauce" on the vinyl, it can stain it. : 
We picked out this chair for our daughter. We love it! I can put her in it while I'm working in the kitchen and she sits in it while we eat dinner. She loves that toy!! 
i was very happy with this product my baby loves it and its wonderful i can fix his food while he is busy playing 
I know this high chair is a little pricy compared to some simple ones. But the pad, the color and the toys that come with this high chair make me feel that I bought the right one for our baby. You can use this one to feed your baby bottled-milk and spoon-served solid food. I hope my baby will develop good eating habit because of using the high chair. We will see! 
I absolutely love this chair! The toys keep my baby busy and the chair is very easy to clean up 
My 4 1/2 month baby girl fits well in this. I was a bit hesitant at first not being sure if she would fit but it all fits very nicely. Make sure you have a decent screwdriver. Will take about 30 mins to set it up. My last chair was a Grace and that was about 8 years ago and chairs have come a long way. Much nicer fit and very smooth to move around if needed. The toy was just the icing on the cake. Would not even think twice about recommending this. This chair is considered one of the best chairs for babies. Always do a review on [...]..

I bought this tub for my baby who is now almost 11 months. I used it since the day we came home from the hospital. I used the mesh and it was wonderful. The mesh swing seems very flimsy, but I used it until my baby was almost 4 months old; it held her weight quite well. My baby is tall, so I do not know if I will be able it to use beyond her 1st birthday. I am playing it by the year. All in all, it is a great tub at a throw-away price. 
I absolutely love and adore this tub. My baby didn't like baths initially until we bought this. He can sit back and slouch comfortably while I get him clean. He feels absolutely secure and safe and I am able to bathe him quickly and with no fuss. It is well designed and has a number of useful details. There is the plug which is heat-sensitive which will change color to let you know if the water is too hot for your baby, a spot to hold the soap and other bathing sundries and the tub itself fits perfectly onto most standard kitchen sinks. I like this last feature in particular because I or my husband don't have to crouch or lean over too much while bathing our baby. Bathtime is always a pleasure with this tub 
We love this tub. We never bothered with the hammock so I can't comment on it. We still use it and she is almost 2 years old! We used the reclining side when she was a baby and used the toddler side after she could sit up on her on. It is so handy to be able to stand up straight at the kitchen sink and bathe her. Before I bought a tub, I thought about getting the Primo tub because it had such great reviews. However, when I saw it in the store, it looked gigantic. I took a chance on the less expensive First Years tub and I can't imagine anything being better. 
we been using this tud for my baby since she is 4wks old , she love the tud, and the baby can be very safe in the tud ,her head is always above the water, so there is no water going in to her ear. she love the tud so much , everytime when we get her out, she start to cry, and if we put her back in , she stop . great price , good for first time mom 
I used this tub with my son from newborn on through to early 2's. It was very convenient to give him his bath at our sink so we stuck with it for quite a while. The nice thing about this tub is it is deep enough for a newborn to recline and stay warm as well as a toddler to have splashing water. I never used the hammock so I have no comment. The tub held up nicely and the pads on the bottom stayed stuck down the entire time even with cleaning products 
This set of waterproof pads is very versitle. I found it difficult to find bassinette and crib pads and this set has both plus other pads, great value 
I bought these sheets because of other reviews stating the thinner sheets were horrible. These on the other hand are nice and soft. I washed and dried these sheets (because I didn't read the instructions) and after reading a few comments that the sheets don't fit after drying decided to break them out to try them for myself. Since our baby isn't due for another 6 weeks I didn't have these things out yet (because the cat would think I set it up for him). Well, I only took out the "mattress" if you will. And proceeded to try an put both sheets (just to make sure) on. It is a tight fit but I also figured it would be since bunching around a baby's face is not something I would have wanted anyways. Well the sheets do fit (at least with the "mattress" out on my bed rather than in the travel crib itself. But it probably would be easier to make it that way anyway. Hope this helps 
THAT LITTLE EXTRA PADDING THAT FITS TIGHTLY AND WASHES EASILY.SLIGHTLY PRICY, BUT WELL WORTH IT 
This is a great quality sheet. It is thicker than the standard pack and play sheets. It adds a little more padding for our munchkin. We purchased it in navy and have washed it several times. The color hasn't faded and it just gets softer with every wash. I highly recommend this product! 
i have a newborn that is extremly picky unlike my first baby, and she won't sleep anywhere hardly but because this is padded she will sleep on it, i have the packn'play that is the bassinet also and this fits great. it's alittle expensive that's why i rated it a 4 instead of a 5 becuase not everyone has the money to spend on the extras like this 
This is a great toy box. It holds a ton of toys and is very sturdy 
We received this as a gift for my son's 2nd birthday, it is GREAT! It is large, deep and holds a lot of toys outside. Durable and has a nice look too. Love it 
This is a great toy box! I read the reviews about the lid being a problem, but all you all to do is take it off or leave it up. I have 2 year old twins, and I am glad the lid is not attached. This lid would end up getting in the way. If your child has a lot of toys, this toybox has an ample amount of storage space. I am very pleased 
I purchased this toybox 2 nights ago from toysrus. It is pretty spacious and sturdy. I really do not like the lid though. It does not stay up very well. It just kind of sits on top of the toy box in these 2 slots. It doesn't actually snap into place so my five little boys constantly take it off. The drawers on the bottom just slide into an open space under the toybox, they are not actually attatched to anything either but they are nice to put the smaller toys in so they don't get lost in the bottom of the toybox. 
I purchased this toy box for my son's room. The colors are great they match his decor perfectly. It is very roomy. It holds more toys than I anticipated. The two storage bins underneath are a life saver. I put all of his small toys in them he can access them easily. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid doesn't stay up that well. It sometimes fall. When he's using his toy box, I just take the lid off to prevent accidents. 
I am giving to this carrier 10 stars! I was using it for 2,5 years and absolutely love it! My two babies love it too. Highly reccomend this carrier 
I have been using the Mei Hip since my son was 7 months old (for 5 months). I love Ella Roo products. I also have the Mei Tai. The key to comfort is to spread the strap across the shoulder so the weight is distributed. It makes running errands and work around the house so much easier. It positions your baby at the hip so you have more range of motion than if he was on your belly/chest as with other carriers. I fully recommend the mei hip. Though I would wait until your baby can hold his head up well as there is no head support so it is not for new babies. 
I bought the Snug Tub Deluxe when my baby outgrew her infant tub that she had to lay down in. She was slipping and sliding all over the "big" tub, so this was the perfect solution to allow her to sit and play in a smaller, more comfortable area than the full tub. Easy to use, dries quickly, worked great for us 
Our 6-month-old loves the tub! It is convenient for us and saves water. Right now he stays occupied with the build-in squeaky toy while we wash him clean. It fits nicely and seems to be pretty sturdy and well made. 
This tub is an excellent transition tub for a baby too big for those little plastic tubs, but too small for the big tub. It is spacious enough for our 11 month old to play (and he is a big 11 month old), and provides nice soft sides so that when he slips he doesn't bang his head on the hard sides of the tub. We got the deluxe with the toys, but I think they are more entertaining to me than to him. I wish that we had skipped the traditional plastic tub and went straight to this. Great buy 
Our toddler had this tub when he turned 7 months old, until about a year and a half old (when our cat punctured it!). It was so fantastic that we bought it again for our next baby. This tub is the perfect size, is comfortable and safe because it's inflated, travels nicely, and our kids love it. Our 2 1/2 year old still wants to use his sister's tub a few nights a week! 
I love that this is a soft tub. No hard platic egdes. The other problem I had with a traditional infant tub was that my baby outgrew it to fast. I use this tub with a bath sling for my baby that cannot sit up on her own yet. When she can sit on her own, I will use the tub alone. I have one complaint. The suction cup that is used to hang the tub fell off after minimal use and I can not get it back on 
Like the other reviewer, I needed something my daughter could splash around in while I took a shower. By the way, I'm sure neither of us leave our children unattended. We want our children to accompany us as we bathe, so I purchased this tub, as she had grown out of her other tubs. It is a great tub. It is large in size, but we have a very large shower, so it works great for us. It does work great in the regular tub too. My daughter can't wait to climb in. The only drawback is mine got a tear in the side, but we had it for a while, so I'm going to purchase another one. You also can't find inflatable tubs very easily. I highly recommend this tub 
Well, everything I said below is true but now 10 months later the tub has developed it's 3rd leak so we have to inflate it every night with a foot pump. I'm giving up and ordering another one. Not bad for every day use for 10 months though. My original review: When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using. We couldn't find the snug tub in any of the stores (Babies R Us carries their own brand, Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small). With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm. She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible. Well this tub is the answer. It is everything the reviewers have said - convenient (blow up once and store with suction hook), big (lots of room for toys and splashing), secure (fits very snugly, thus the name) and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it. And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys. Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish. So bath with peace of mind and have fun with the little one 
These toys are great. Easy to use. They even taught my 2 year old how to not only blow, but I think it indirectly taught her how to blow her nose too. Will be a toy for years to come in the tub. 
My daughters ages 4 and 1 received these for Christmas and absolutely love them. I do as well. They are very easy to use. Fill with different levels of water and play different notes. Very cool idea for a toy. We haven't tried actually playing songs since they love making their own music with them. Really great bath toy 
I love the Einstein toys and this is no exception. My daughter is 6 months old and likes to listen to the music, look into the mirror, and chew on the fins. The only problem I have is that it is a little heavy for her to pick up yet. But as you can see in the picture I submitted, she likes playing with it on level ground just fine 
The best purchase I mae for my newborn. He is cosleeping with us and it fits perfectly in between my husband and I. Also the insert fits in his moses basket and crib . Great because of the incline for his upper body. Sleeps and sleeps seems super cozy. Worth the money!!!! 
Our first night home with our daughter, we planned on her sleeping in her basinette next to the bed. Just before putting her to sleep, our cat jumped in the basinette, and I was distraught thinking that she would do this again when the baby was asleep in it. Because we have a soft mattress, I couldn't bear the thought of my daughter sleeping with us, so I spend a sleepless night in the recliner with her on my chest. First thing the next day, we went to the store, and bought the snuggle nest. The selling points for use were the size, and the light. It fit perfectly between us on our king size bed, and the light allows me to breastfeed and change the baby without overstimulating her. And because I had had a c-section, it was wonderful not getting out of bed all the time. Two weeks later, I was ready to put her in the bassinette again. The best part was, because of its size, the nest fits in it perfectly. My daughter never knew the difference between bed and basinette. I am planning on using it to transition her to the crib as well. I would recommend this product to anybody that wants to co-sleep, had a c-section, or just wants to provide a snug place for their little one to sleep without worry 
I have the Safety first bed. So I can't comment on this exact product but the idea of it is still the same. After having a c/s I was wiped out and in pain. I didn't want to get out of bed and I had planned on having my son sleep with me. I was scared of course to share a bed with an infant so we bought one of these beds. I love it!! Mine has a nightlight at the top that comes in really handy. If you want to co-sleep you need this 
Being a first time parent I wasn't sure exactly how to go about co-sleeping... Although I knew I wanted some type of device to keep my baby a bit secure. I could have never imagined I'd be so pleased, or have so many uses for this cozy little bed! The obvious use is in bed with parents. It is a perfect fit our full size bed (admittedly we're not the kind of people who feel the need for lots of room to spread out). The sides of the bed are just high enough and sturdy enough to give you feel of being next to baby, without the feel of rolling on top of baby. The light on the bed is perfect for a quick peek. I also put my daughter in this nest during nap time. The sleep positioners keep her feeling snuggled and cozy. It's also convenient if you're the type of parent who likes to have baby near at all times. This little bed can be carried from one room to another without waking baby. I found it wonderful for transitioning to the crib. I simply placed the nest in the crib and she felt right at home! Finially, this is the perfect little bed to bring along for travel! I would strongly suggest this item to anyone interested in co-sleeping 
MY baby had slpt in our bed since the day we brought her home from the hospital. But I my husband and I were always afaid of squishing her and she tended to want to sleep glued on to me wich wasn't to comfortable let alone safe. I was searching on line one day and came across this on another web site I instantly knew that this was what I wanted. I shopped around and found a different brand of this type of bed and ordered it, it does not have a sleep positioner but i amhappy about that since my baby hated hers. and mine also has a foot rest on the botton so that the baby cant oooze out. The only problem with this is we have a queen size bed and there is barley enough room in it for all of us, but we make due and this would fit great in a king size bed. My little girl loves this thing and sleeps better through the night in it. and she can sleep close to me with being practally on top of me, I would recomned this to any parent who wants to co-sleep with their baby but wants a little piece of mind. as for people who are against co-sleeping then this is not a product for yo 
Our baby wasn't sleeping too well in her bassinet when we first brought her home. Being first time parents, we were afraid to bring her into bed with us for fear of smushing her. So we went to Babies R Us and found this, purely by accident. Yes, the price is a little high for what we use mostly as just a sleep positioner, but we love that it folds up for travel. We are planning to skip the bassinet for a few upcoming trips and just take this with us. We have a queen-sized bed, and it is a bit snug for the three of us to fit, but we can do it. Now she is tolerating the bassinet so we've moved the nest to her bassinet. It inclines, and sometimes she wiggles down, but she is still positioned on her back! It comes with TWO sheets, which is great! It has a handy LED nightlight for quick pacifier replacement or covert diaper checks. The bedding is firm but comfy. I am very happy with the product, and I would recommend it to others. It's a pretty new product otherwise I would have put it on my registry when I was still pregnant. 
Although the hippopotamus is my daughters favorite, there isn't a toy here she doesn't like. Highly recommended! We have tons of fun 
I tried a couple other slings that didn't work for me. I didn't like the over the shoulder baby holder type one because I could never get it right. I have a snuggly type one which was okay but still hard on my back. This one is lengthy but worth it once you have used it and become quick at it. I found if I want to work on the computer it is great he sleeps on my chest, snuggled up, and I can type with both hands. I have not tried to nurse in it so I am not sure how well that works. I have used it front and tummy facing. My husband even wore it while cooking and found it handy 
First off, there is not one baby carrier that does it all. This wrap is absolutely amazing however. I would recommend it for when you will need your hands free for an extended period of time. I use it for walks, traveling, and around the house if my baby just wants that close contact or is fussy. Once you get the hang of how to wrap this you can get them in and out in just over a min. My baby takes super long naps when in this and is so comfy and so am I. My other carrier that I have hurts my back after awhile and I suffer for days; never with this carrier. There are so many positions for this too. I found a website with a European carrier that shows better pictures and one more position, same idea.[...]I also found that it is easiest to put it on when first folding the wrap in half lengthwise, then spreading it out when secure. Though it is not as easy to nurse with the baby in this carrier, it is pretty easy to take them out and put them back once you are used to the sling. If I had it my way I would have this (for long periods up and about, and fussy babies, or for those with bad backs), a sling (for newborns and nursing), and a backpack (only for short trips, like laundry or carrying groceries up). If I had to pick one however this above all would be it!! One more thing, it is ok to wear this in warm weather, just dress accordingly (you and your baby). The pocket is a plus as well. Oh, and I do find it easier, once on, to get baby in and out of than a back pack or front carrier. This also is suitable right off the bat for new borns and many stages there after 
I bought this carrier b/c i saw my midwives carrying their babies in it at the maternity center - they highly recommended it. well i bought it. our son has been in this carrier since he was born in October, we are in april and he still rides in it and he weighs almost 19lbs. and babies that are in these types of carriers seem to be the happiest. they spend 40 weeks with you, what makes you think when they are born they want to be away from you. it's also great for babies with colic it is the best wrap EVER!!! 1. this creates no pressure points at all!!! you DON'T feel it in your shoulders or lower back. as a massage therapist i highly recommend it b/c it does not ruin your posture i do feel his weight in my thighs - which for me is fine - my legs are getting stronger 2. i breastfeed him with the shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him in my arms - wherever we go - restaurants, etc.. and people never notice they think he is sleeping 3. you can put the baby in different positions 4. they take the best naps in it 5. be prepared for all the attention and questions as to where you bought it and how it feels 6. it it soo easy to put on, but you MUST WATCH THE VIDEO it comes with. once you get the hang of it - it' a breeze - i put it on in less than 30 seconds 7. and instead of looping the wrap through the rings to hold it in place i just tie it into a knot 8. you have TWO free hands ENJOY!!!!!!! 
I had to buy this baby wrap through e-bay because amazon would not ship outside the US. My baby loves it, we flew from Dublin to London both ways and you would not have know that there was a baby on the flight, because she slept through the whole journey. She just loves it, she falls asleep everytime I put her in it. She is just over 2 months old and weighs nearly 11 pounds. It's so comfortable, I actually went on a 1 mile walk with her the other day and did not feel the strain on my shoulders. I tried the other baby carriers, the regular ones and that was like hell, luckily I had only borrowed it and had not bought one, it dug into my shoulders and left me aching for a day. The wrap is soft, it keeps the baby warm in the winter and cool in the summer as it's made out of cotton and lycra. Most importantly it's comfortable to wear for both Mum/Dad and Baby. Highly recommended! I usually don't write reviews but I just had to mention something about the wrap because I'm absolutely over the moon with it. By the way it's really easy to put on, it only took me a couple of minutes to get the hang of it 
I never had much luck with traditional baby carriers. The ones I tried were uncomfortable to wear and hurt my back and shoulders. It also never seemed like my daughter got truely comfortable. I love this wrap because it of it's versatility (which is something most carriers lack) and is reasonably priced. The Soft, stretchy fabric, which is great, provides even weight distribution and makes my daughter feel safe and secure. After watching the dvd, using the wrap is very easy and practical. My daughter especially likes the front facing position, it really lets her explore the world. I do believe using the wrap has allowed us to bond much more in great new ways. After searching and testing various products this is the best! I highly recommend this product. 
My son is now 3 months old and has had a rough go with acid reflux. He loves to be held and especially upright. He hated my Snuggli (like the baby Bjorn)and I needed my hands free with two older children. It is so comfortable and doesn't hurt my back and shoulders the way the front carrier did. I get comments on everywhere I go. They all want to know where I got it and thought it was quite a fashion statement. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this wrap. I was intimidated before I ordered it wondering if I would be able to figure it out. The instructional DVD is so easy to follow. I only had to watch it twice through and haven't given it another look 
I spent alot of money trying out new bottles with various different nipples sizes. These are by far the best bottles on the market. I have read the feeback other people left about the bottles leaking and extra cleaning parts, but the bottles perform really well. I have never had a leaking issue with them and cleaning is not a big deal considering what the product delivers. The bottle helps reduce the air and gasiness babies get from regular feeding bottles including the over-rated Playtex drop ins. The Drop ins are too costly and still get air inside them if you set the bottle down 
Dr. Brown's bottles are the best! We tried everything else and wasted a lot of time and money... Do not waste your time and buy Dr. Brown's bottles... 
These new wide neck Dr Browns are a great updated version of the skinny original bottles. I like the nipple shape much better, it is easy to transition from the breast to this bottle. Very easy to clean as well 
My daughter tried several bottles for our granddaughters who both had acid reflux. These are the greatest bottles and only bottles that helped them with the gas and upset stomaches. They also are great if you need to add cereal to their milk because of the acid reflux. The wide bottles are great for this. You should only fill the bottles up to the 8oz line and you won't have any problems with the bottles leaking. I would recommend these bottles to anyone and especially parents with acid reflux babies.  
I originally purchased Avent everything - bottle warmer, microwave steam sterilizer, etc and therefore thought the bottles would be great. However, the Avent bottles leaked everywhere and you could hear my son sucking in tons of air when he ate, causing a tremendous amount of gas etc. Because I had used Avent, I bought the wide neck Dr. Brown bottles and they have been a life saver. I threw all of my Avent bottles away. The Dr. Brown bottles NEVER leak and my son rarely has any gas and is so much happier - I also nurse him and these nipples seem to fit my son's little mouth similarly to the breast. The bottles are also easy to clean - just one more (easy) step than other bottles. 
I bought this mirror because it was on sale and I'm glad I did. The mirror is very large and I can see my son clearly without having to shift or strain like I did with a previous mirror. The colours are also bright and attractive and get his attention as soon as I put him in the seat, he seems to talk to the butterfly incessantly. Although It does not play music and light up like some other mirrors, he has a few car seat toys that will also distract him well enough when he looses interest in the mirror. I gave it only four stars because it was a bit difficult to install in my particular car. My middle seat does not have a headrest to attach it to , nor does it have a latch so I had to resort to using some pins to keep it in place. But all in all a great item. 
I saw this on fisher price sight and I fell in love with it! I was able to find it @ Toys-r-us store. My 3 y.o daughter seems to love it too! It comes with a carry on so you can take it anywhere. I usually keep it in the back of my suv. It's especially very convenient when there is no place to stop when she really has to go . I just pull over in a parking lot, open it and she sits in it and goes! It helps avoid accidents in her car seat. The only drawback though is that it has a built in cup. It's not removable.My daughter doesn't seem to mind it. I don't know if fisher price makes one for little girls 
My 3 year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift. The basket, canned goods, and produce pieces are very nice. The boxes, however, are very flimsy hollow cardboard and are showing wear after only three days of play, so I know they won't last long. At this price I don't expect wooden boxes, but solid cardboard construction would be a better design for the age range to which this set is marketed. My daughter likes this set very much, and I think it will give her lots of enjoyment while it lasts 
I have owned two of these warmers for about 5 years now--they have been consistently plugged in and they are STILL working!! These gadgets make it so much easier to pull wipes out when you need them, and they are also nice and warm for the baby. I love the fact that you can use any type of baby wipe in them, and if the wipes happen to dry out you can add ordinary water to the warmer to rehydrate them. Excellent investment! 
This warmer is a must have. It stops most of the squirming and fighting over changes(once your child gets past the newborn stage). The wipes are nice and warm, but not shockingly hot. I would suggest adding the 1/2 cup of water to the container if you live in a dry climate. I like this model because it does NOT have a built in night light (eventually the light will become attractive to toddlers). It also works very well with any type of wipe, pop-ups and singles. I wish they had portable ones. 
I bought this wipe warmer for my son right after he was born because he hated diaper changes. So, I thought that it was the coldness of the wipes that upset him. My son is now 4 months old, and ever since we got it, we have had no problems with "fits" during diaper changes. Not 1! It doesn't stay "hot" very long after you take it out of the warmer, but it is still warm. I have never had a problem with it and would reccommend it to everyone...especially mom's with boys. 
This is one of the best gifts we received for our twins! Both girls cried horribly when the cold wipes touched their bottoms. Which is horrible for those middle-of-the-night changes when you want to disturb them as little as possible. Grant you the wipes don't stay hot for very long but they do take the chill out. As for "drying-out" the wipes, the instructions say to add about 1/4 cup of water if needed, which works great. We've only had to add water once, and that was to a cheap brand of wipes that weren't very wet to begin with. I definately recommend this to mothers of multiples! I plan to buy another to keep downstairs (our nursery is on the second floor) for those in-between changes 
when i had my oldest, i did not have this product. he often got upset when being changed which resulted in him crying. it always took a while to calm him down. i recieved this as a gift and was pleasently suprised. my wipes never turn brown or dry out as long as i use a thick wipe such as huggies wipes. my son's tooshie stays warm and it also wipes off easier. the result is having your child staying calm and happy. i do think it works a billion times better than holding it in your hand and who wants to hold them in your hand to warm when so often you need one right after another. i think it's not a luxery, but a necessity 
I just received this warmer as a shower gift. I was hesitant to register for it in the beginning because of so many negative reviews. However, after trying it out, I've found that it is a pretty decent product. It's true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds, but really, how long does it take to wipe a baby off? The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes. I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes, which should be comforting to the baby. When I first used it, I didn't add the water as suggested in the manual, just to see how it would work. The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1/2 cup of water and haven't noticed any more drying. All of the wipes are still moist. I haven't noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes. My baby hasn't arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work. I think when he does get here in a couple of weeks, he will be thankful that I used a decently warm wipe instead of a cold one 
I recieved this warmer as a Christmas gift when my daughter was a month old. I think its great!! I haven't had trouble with the wipes getting dry....but for those who have, please note the owners manual which says to add some water to keep the wipes from getting dry. No, the wipes don't stay warm for long but the idea of this product is to take the chill off the wipes, not make them hot. I don't have any complaints with this product and I have recommended it to seveal of my friends. I feel it is a definite must have 
This is great especially for that first trip home from the hospital. The head rest that comes with car seats doesn't compare! This provides full body support and gives baby that secure feeling. As long as you use it properly it is safe to use and allows you to properly secure seat straps 
I enjoyed this for my baby. But they grow out of this rather quickly. 
The Snuzzler is perfect for newborns and provides comfort and warmth to a tiny little body in the car seat or stroller. Since we're in a warm climate though, my baby seems to sweat on the back of his head 
This support can be used in almost anything (bouncers, swing, and strollers). I bought it to use in my Baby Jogger stroller and it works wonderfully. There is actually a Snuzzler designed specifically for Baby Jogger which costs more. This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost $15 less! I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby's head forward, so I removed it. But she was already 3 months old when I bought it, so it might work well for newborns 
When we brought our daughter home all we had was one of those tiny little head supports. Well as she was only 6lbs at birth it wasn't very good support for her. A freind bought this for her and we love it. I don't have to worry about her sliding around in her carseat at all. It kinda hugs them. She is snug as a bug in there. I love this and would recommend this to everyone to bring their newborn home in 
My son was a big baby, checking in at over 9 pounds and 22 inches, but the headrests that came with the carseat still didn't offer enough support. We were fortunate to have received this product at our baby shower. He looked so cozy with the fleece side cuddling him and he was very well supported. Now that it's over 80 degrees, we've flipped it over to use the cooler fabric and he still loves it. My son is almost 8 weeks old, so we tried taking it out of our carseat and just using the headrest that came with the carseat. But, it still doesn't offer enough support. Once he falls asleep, his little head just hung over the side, so we put the snuzzler back in and he's much happier. It is a bit trickier to get the car seat straps safely adjusted around the support, but after a few days we had the hang of it. 
The snuzzler is one of my favorite things to use for my preemie son. He was a larger preemie, coming home at 6 lbs, but it's still a great help, as he was still small. It makes car rides enjoyable for him, I think he feels cuddled by it, just as we cuddle him. It's also great to sit him in if he's having a rough night sleeping....we'll sit him in his carseat and within minutes he's out like a light 
We got this for our son when he was 5 months because going out to restrauants were getting too much. IT lasted all the way up to a year and a half. This model has a ferris-wheel design. It contains a hologram fish scene, a rattle, touch and feel fabric around a ball, and fish toy. It does come off easily and doesn't pivot like the rocking-horse model but will hold baby's interest. Put this together with a bunch of others to have the time to eat and actually get things done 
My baby LOVES this toy! 4 Months old and I bring it with us when we go out. He falls to sleep quickly when I just set it in front of him and rotate it around, he hears the rattles and it soothes him. The fish has beads in it, the cylinder thing has a spiral around it which facinates him along with little stars which make a neat rattle. The round sphere has a mirror in it which swivels along with little ribbon pieces that stick out making a little more touch/feel interest and the flat piece has a holographic fish on it that swims when you move it. All in all it is his favorate toy. It does a good job when suctioned to a glass top table, but will come off anything else. :) Oh well... 
My daughter enjoys playing with this toy...but like every suction cupped toy or bowl I have tried with her, she can get them off!!! So she is talented...what can I say! Just kidding! She does trully like to play with it, whether it is still stuck to the table or not 
very nice gate very sturdy good quality, would be good to keep small children or animals out or in an area. It didnt work for me I bought it to keep my ferrets contained but the gaps are to big (under gate and at opposite hinge side!) it does keep the dogs contained though! : 
I got this gate for my two Miniature Pinschers and I love it. I use it as a pressure mount in a doorway. I previously had one of those plastic ones with all the holes but I opted for this one not only for the look but for the safety. It is virtually impossible for the dogs to climb over it. It does get scratched very easily, but that doesnt bother me, I expected it with two small dogs scratching at it when they want out! Overall I was impressed with the design and how well made it is. I would recommend this to anyone with small dogs as long as you dont mind the scratches 
Love this gate - we have 2 blocking stairs and kitchen. One comment on installation - you MUST use the measure tape/ruler they provide to locate where the gate hinges are fastened to the wall, that's why the top will pop out (on an earlier review). Eyeballing it is not the way to fasten it. There are specific heights to install that make this gate safe. Will be purchasing one for the top of the stairs as well, and have no doubt it will be fine. They provide good long screws, so as long as you have a banister or stud, you'll be fine. 
It was really easy to install and I think it looks alot nicer than other gates. It is very easy to open and close 
I actually ordered this as a pet safety gate for a new puppy. This is so easy to use! And no damaging the door frame with hardware. Very sturdy - no problems with it staying in place. Also lightweight easy to handle 
I loved this gate so much, I bought two. I use one mounted to the wall and the other is tension mount without the hardware, either way, they both work great for keeping our little monster off the stairs. Highly recommended 
The product was fine it would not fit on the baby bed I had, because it has sold head foot ends on crib. When I ordered the bumber pad it did not indicate that it would not fit only slatted baby cribs 
This item has been a lifesaver! We no longer have to get up in the middle of the night to put arms, legs, pacifiers or toys back into the crib. I don't remember how we got by without one with our first 
the bumper is useful in that in prevents our son from getting his arms and legs through the crib slats on a regular basis while providing a breathable barrier in case he rolls over with his face against the bumper. my only complaint is that it slides down fairly easily, especially when baby gets his leg on top of it (while laying on his side, not standing) or grabs it. it needs to be readjusted and tightened frequently. nevertheless, we sleep better knowing he doesn't have his face in a thick quilted bumper. and it is really beathable- i put my own nose and mouth to it before installation to check 
The only complaint I really have about this bumper is that no matter how tight you manage to get it, it still slides down and needs to be redone every couple days 
This was a life saver. Our little one likes to move around the crib, but she couldn't figure out how to get "unstuck" when her arm or leg went through the crib slate. We have a crib that turns into a headboard/footboard and it still works great. 
This is a great product! It not only saves your seats from the indentations that the car seats leave, but they also catch a lot of food from messy kids. My sister, my mom, and I have all purchased these for our cars and we all love them 
I bought two of these seat savers for my Honda Odyssey to accommodate Britax Marathon carseats. Yes, the bases are wide, but isn't that the point? The non-slip surface on the underside grips the leather very well and my car seats have no slip and slide when latched in and secured. The front flap is great for keeping melting snow and ice and general muck from my kid's shoes off the front of the seat. I wished I'd bought a third for the infant car seat! 
No more nasty indentions in your seats. No more out of control chocolate milk spills. I purchased the StageSeat Saver for my brand new SUV mainly because my daughter eats like a caveman (no offense to any living neaderthals). She can now enjoy a beverage and snack without getting crumbs all over the floor and seat below her carseat. The Seat Saver does a wonderful job containing ALL spills and can be removed and cleaned very easily. It is made of a hard rubber material and does not move around once your child's carseat is securely fastened. It also has a lower flap that sits low enough so that your toddlers muddy shoes will not scuff up the front edges of your vehicle's seats. I recommend this for ALL car seats in your vehicle 
I was somewhat hesitant to purchase after reading the review describing how the seat would become loose or could not be secured tightly. But, the other reviews seemed positive so I decided to give it a try. I did not have any problems. I was able to secure the seat very tightly with no movement at all. 
We bought one of these a month after our daughter was born 2 years ago and it has worked perfectly. We have a Tahoe with leather seats and before we got this her seat moved around to much no matter how tight the seat belt was. Since we have started using this her carseats have been fine, they stay tight with this and don't move around. I am going to buy another one for our second child 
It is simpler than I thought it would be. No diaper sausage like with the diaper genie. We use scented bags to curb the smell a little extra. I would definitey recommend it to anyone 
Ive used this for 2 months now and it is great. The very best feature is that you can use any type of bag. A great way to use up all those plastic grocery bags. It holds a lot of diapers and does a great job of containing the odor, of course you must empty it every few days or they will begin to smell 
I planned to get one for my second child n i had girl this time.I thought of color pink as best.To get DiaperChamp in pink color made me happy.Its excellent choice.I wud recommend to get one it will make life easy for u with all diaper work 
My husband and I bought a diaper champ instead of getting refills for our diaper genie. This is very easy to use one-handed, uses 8 gallon bags that we have around the house, and blocks the odor MUCH better than the diaper genie ever did. I highly recommend this to all diaper-using households 
This thing is a dream come true. It operates with one hand! Drop the soiled diaper into the opening. With a flick of the wrist the diaper is gone. It's THAT simple! Love this thing! And it uses regular 13 gallon size kitchen bags. No special bags to buy. This is in my top 10 new baby necessities 
My 2-year old is starting the potty training process. It's the perfect size. The only thing that could make it better is if it wrapped around the toilet a little further. That way he could stand closer to the toilet when he pees. I don't think you'll find a step stool like that so this is the next best thing 
I keep this step in my sons bathroom along with the Bjorn toilet seat. The simple design makes it so easy to clean and use. Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper step stools made of thin plastic or cheap wood and wont purchase them again. I love how sturdy the design is. I also use this stool to sit on next to the tub while bathing my son, saves my back 
This stool is working fine for us. It is stable and safe, non-slip, and it is nice and small so I can move it out of the way easily, and light-weight so my 2 year old son can easily move it into place by himself. I am not sure that I couldn't have found a similiar stool for less money, but I like the fact that it's just plain black and white and it doesn't look tacky in the guest bath. I did try a couple of the wooden steps, and they were too big and heavy, and I couldn't move them out of the way. Plus, they were more expensive than this one. The only complaint I have about this stool is I wish it was about an inch taller so that my son's feet could rest flat footed on it when he's on the toilet. Otherwise, it's a good little stool. 
Love this set of toys.great for the babys to teeth on and work on cordination.my grand son just loves this set.so happy I found it 
Upppss, my four months old son doesn't stop to play with these toys. He loves the crab! 
I received this mattress to use in my davinci Valerie crib and it fits perfect! It's very sturdy can be wiped off easily with a cloth when accidents happen. I am very confident that my baby girl will be super comfy on this mattress. 
My son has had this mattress for over 2 years now and its form is still great.He wont sleep anywhere else other than his bed. We now use it for his toddler bed and I have layed down on it a few times (pretending to nap) and believe it is more comfortable than my bed!!! It is a really full mattress that offers great support for our little ones spines!! That is why we purchased our second one for our new daughter. I know my son isnt ready to give his bed up!! 
My Daughter and I LOVE this. I actually saw this before I was pregnant and loved it because I love Turtles. I always said I would buy this. I know that it's a bit pricey for what it is, but I justified it by making it my daughters gift for her first Christmas (she was only 1 month old). I put her to bed with it turned on in blue light and play soft relaxing music. She honestly goes down pretty well. It casts starts across her crib and up her walls and both my mom and husband complimented on how soothing I made her night time. the only thing is that the Amber light doesn't seem to work well in showing the stars, but there is Blue and Green. There is actually star constellations that it casts and it comes with a little book showing which ones they are. 
As soon as I saw it I fell in love with it. I bought it for my baby's room thinking it would only shine the stars on the ceiling, but after receiving it not only shines on the ceiling, but the walls too. It is real soft and light weight and at night the stars give off just enough light to make any child feel comfortable. The amber light is not that bright but the other colours are vibrant. This is a great product that I would recommend to anyone. 
We were very happy with the Turtle. My 2 year old loves to play with it and we like to steal it and try to find the constellations. The Amber does not show up unless it is really dark, but the blue and green work perfect 
After reading the reviews, both good and bad, I could not wait to get this product and when it came today I had to try it out. The stars are great. It is just a nightlight so if you are expecting something elaborate of the night sky...think again. It is hard over the shell and the rest of the body is plush, but it is not a toy. Just cute to look at. I think all of the light settings are great. Blue is the brightest and amber is the dimmest, but they all look great in a dark room. If you want a fancy nightlight...go for it! Worth all the mone 
I purchased this for my granddaughter's 6th birthday. She requested it. She really enjoys having it in her room at night. It makes a night sky on her ceiling. I am getting one for my nephew next month for his 5th birthday 
this was for my granddaughter, and her mother loves it. so convenient to just fold and take with you when your little one has to use a public bathroom. 
This has been the most convient traveling potty seat we have used. Unlike other ones, it has a place toward the front for your little one's hands and prevents your child's legs from coming in contact with the filthly seat. It is also very compact. We have used it on all kinds of toilet seats and have never had a problem with it sliding of the seat or pinching legs like some of the other reviews state. The thing to remember is that it needs to be placed all the way to the front of the toilet seat so the lip on the front of the folding seat secures it. If you try to place it on like the seats used at home then, yes, you will have problems. When used correctly this seat is great 
I love the PRIMO Folding Potty! It is the best! It is so compact and easy to carry with me when I take my son to the stores or restaurants. I haven't had any problems finding toilets that it doesn't work on. My son finds it very secure, especially when he can hold on to the handles. I love the fact that he has handles to hold onto instead of the dirty toilet bowl. It is very sturdy and easy to clean 
I bought this item when it was on sale for only eight dollars and change although it had mostly bad reviews and low star rating. I live in a approx. 1900 sq foot home and from one end to the other it picked up with almost no static what so ever. For the price I payed it gets the job done well 
I really like this monitor. You can see if the baby is moving even before they start to cry. Really good 
This monitor was initially indispensable in caring for our twins. The default channel had too much static to use, but once we switched over to the 'B' setting, that stopped being a problem. I can hear everything through the monitor, even being able to distinguish between my two children breathing. I love the option to turn off the sound and see whether the babies are noisy - one of my girls HATED bedtime until she was a few months old, and this allowed us to let us see whether she was still crying after 5 minutes without having to go in the room or listen to the I-hate-bedtime screaming. After nine months of daily use, the receiver stopped working, but this is decent value for the price. I found that the Safety First monitor I bought picked up the sounds from this one's base, but with increased sensitivity. It would have been nice if the nightlight could be turned on without the monitor relaying sound, but the option to turn the nightlight off is fine 
This tub is worth every penny! It is large, but I keep it under the crib where it's out of the way and easily accessed. The best thing about this tub is how it holds a small baby in place while you bathe him or her. My baby is 4 weeks old but I'm sure I'll continue to like it as he grows 
We love this carrier. We live in Seattle and need a carrier for all kinds of trips We are both happy with this purchase. I am 5'2 and my husband is 6'0 and we can both use it with ease very comfortable for us and our daughter. Just a FYI you really need 2 people to put it on and take it off safetly. That carrier has MASSIVE STORAGE. Very good all around carrier. Very good price! 
This was a Christmas gift for my son and his wife. They have a 20 month old daughter and were expecting a new baby this month (she has since been born). My son was VERY pleased and excited about this particular carrier. He had seen one somewhere but he said this one was even better and was looking forward to using it for their older daughter on their next outting as a family! 
Our 9 month old daughter greatly enjoys the view from the backpack. We have used it in the grocery store, in the airport and on walks. There is plenty of storage so that I did not need a carry-on in the airport. 
We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year. The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly. I find that if you adjust it right, most of the weight is placed on your hips. Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it. She even fell asleep once. She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even "sings" as she gets bounced around. We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby (she was born with acid reflux). However, we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up. She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground. I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it (too short to really grab). Interesting enough, she never tries to grab my wife's hair. I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair. There are lots of pockets, although if you are wearing the pack, the pockets are very difficult to access, even the ones on the hip. The hip pockets seem too far back (I have a 38" waist). My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do. When taking off the pack, the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem. We dont use the hood. Its not too difficult to put on. Just takes a little time to figure it out. I am 5'10" and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me. My wife is 5'7" and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle-top. At first, it felt awkward walking with the weight, but after a couple of walks, we got used to it. Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk. Im glad we got the pack. We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone 
Great product that fits the co-sleeper mattress/pad perfectly. I loved the velcro on the sheet to ensure that it stayed in place on the mattress pad and to ensure that the pad stayed in place in the crib/co-sleeper. Highly recommend 
I cannot say enough positive things about this item! I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night. This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids. 
I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton. I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product. They are wonderful. If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small. 
My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital. Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets. He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old. I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security. He was never able to sleep without being in it. He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack. We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it. That is how much he loves his sleep sack. It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son 
Muy buena adquisición. El bebé se siente cómodo y confortable 
Like any parent, I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets. Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous). So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex 
These are so awesome! I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets. One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night, so I put a blanket over him - well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing. Very scary. So if anything, make sure you have more than one sleep sak. 
My wife, who is pregnant with twins, loves this. It's the only thing allowing her to sleep at night. It ended up being one of the best Christmas presents under the tree 
I love this breast pump. I only wish I bought it sooner. I bought a cheap breast pump at first, but it broke down after only a month of use. Due to daycare issues, I had to leave my son with my parents for a week, so I had to pump exclusively. After the second day with the cheap pump, my milk production cut in half to about 3 oz total from both sides every 3 hours. Then I had to wait longer to even get that much! I went out and bought this pump out of desperation and couldn't be happier. It took me about 4 pumping sessions for my body to get into a rhythm, but then it was great. I started pumping more milk in less time than the cheap pump. Now I use the pump 2-3 times a day at work and occasionally on the weekends. A couple of tips: If you have larger breasts, buy the larger shields. I am a D cup and the 27 mm shields are perfect for me. As soon as I switched to the larger shields, the minor discomfort I had pumping went away and I started getting about another ounce of milk out on each side in the same amount of time. Also, to use the dual function, turn on the pump before you put the shields to your breast. I've been doing that and I haven't had a problem positioning them correctly with the pump on. I've never had a problem with cleaning the pieces. I make sure and give the pieces a really good washing once a day, but in between each pumping, I wash everything quick with soap and my hand and let it dry. I've never had a problem with the pieces not drying in time before the next pumping. Also, when I bought my pump, they included an extra set of membranes. You can also buy microwave sterilization bags from Medela to clean everything in, including the membranes, which can't go in the dishwasher. Also, since the pump works with any bottle, you don't have to continually wash one bottle to use with the pump. I just stick nipples on the bottles I pumped in and take them to daycare, then grab the next set of clean bottles out of the cabinet for the next day. I must say, this pump saved my milk supply. I even have a freezer full of extra breastmilk. Even though it is much more expensive than some of the other pumps, I've saved more than its cost in formula, so it's been worth it financially, not to mention the extra benefits of breastmilk that my son has continued to have. I plan on keeping mine for my next child and I would definitely recommend this product to other moms 
I bought this pump from the lactation consultant at our child's pediatrician's office. After I went back to work, it proved to be an excellent purchase. I was able to pump discreetly at work and cool my milk in the attached cooler. If we took a trip, I could take the pump and pump in the car using the battery attachment or even in our hotel room. At one time the pump was not suctioning properly. When I called Medela, they were so helpful. They assistemd me while I was on the phone to get it working properly. It still didn't work so they offered me a new pump in exchange for my old one. Andreaetta [... 
This pump is well worth the cost if you plan on pumping regularly. As a working mother who has been nursing for eleven months, I can honestly say that this pump is the reason I'm still able to breastfeed. I pump twice a day while at work, and this pump has never given me a problem. It has multiple speeds and vacuum settings, so it's very easy to make pumping comfortable. I've even used the battery pack to pump while driving twice in a pinch. Everything you need is included! I was even able to use other brands of bottles with the pump. I can't say enough good things about this product. 
This pump works great for me as a working Mom. It looks professional and I can even fit my lunch in the top. I also love how quickly I can set it up in my office to pump. It is a bit loud so don't try to use it on conference calls unless you hide it under you desk and close the flap. And even then you'll want to check it with a friend listening on the phone for it first. Our battery pack didn't work at first and we didn't check it until we were on the road, so check yours. The white membranes also must be kept very clean and the yellow tips they go in. Even a little bit of old milk will completely kill the suction. But it is worth it even with this issue. Buy it from your lactation nurse at the hospital and then you have someone to give you guidance on how to use it and deal with any issues you have with parts. Although you shouldn't have many. 
I have read the other reviews and find some differing opinions. I loved this pump because it was very effective for my needs. I used it everyday at work for 6 months. It took 20 minutes to express the milk I had and the bags that go with the pump accurately measure the milk. Also, I was able to use one arm and hand to hold the cups in place while I made phone calls with the other. I can't imagine another pump being more effective 
The crib set itself is stunning- if you like something contemporary.I ordered it from baby age and had the same thing happen- received a pink feeding pillow.They weren't very helpful or pleasant in the way they handled the transaction. They did not honour the advertised price.I ended up buying the ultra bedding set from a local boutique 
4-1/2 stars!!! I would have given it a full 5 stars if it had fit my toilet better. I had to kind of slide-cram it into place, but it was sturdy flexible enough to take it(thank goodness). And it's definetly taken some hassel out of potty training. It's already there to just flip down just as easy to clean as I'm cleaning the rest of the toilet. I would fully reccomend this as a gift for any house that children frequent! 
My granddaughter is 3 years old and has been potty trained for quite some time now..when she used the regular training potty seat she always wanted me to accompany her but now that she has a Flip n Flush she likes to go alone. I recommend this for any child who wants the independence of going to the potty alone. It's a great invention 
Have you ever tried to get your infant into a jacket, snowsuit or thick blanket and then into the carseat straps? Not so easy huh? Well this fabulous product saved me from that headache - although I tried just to see if it really was that difficult! I love that I can put my now 9 month old into the carseat with the bundle me and zip her up! Thats it! the front covers her face if it is windy and she is warm and cozy inside! On especially cold days or when she is dressed for cute rather than cold I put an extra blanket on her inside the bundle me and she cant throw it off! I have the lite version which I used all spring and summer (air conditioned car) and now this one for the fall and winter! Some have commented on how easy it is to move baby in the bundle me from carseat to stroller - I have to disagree I would just get a second one for the stroller. The velcro in the back that holds it into the carset will wake up a sleeping baby if you try to remove the whole thing with baby inside. A great product 
I own 2 of these - one for each stroller. It is so convenient for keeping my daughter toasty without having to mess with bulky sweaters and coats that will only need removing once we reach our destination. Also saves me the trouble of having to wake her - I can just peel back the top cover, or zip it off altogether. Also, I've received countless compliments on how stylish and practical it is, not to mention water resistent, which is great for Seattle! 
this product is wonderful. I love the fact that it is all attatched and cannot fall off when baby kicks. The only dislike i have is that the top sometimes blows off baby's face when it is windy. wouldn't be so bad if i had an extra hand to hold it down, but i also have a 2yr old. i wish there were some way of it staying down on it's own 
I purchased this item myself, and I absolutly LOVE it! The Bundle Me makes it so easy get baby ready to go, instead of having to put a coat on her, etc. I get many compliments on it, and am glad that I spent the extra money on this version, the material is so soft warm, and it's great quality. Now instead of getting my daughter new coats to fit her, (and to match her wardrobe!) I have the Bundle Me ready to go, already in the carseat! I would definately recommend this item, and would proudly purchase it as a gift for anyone having a baby in the wintertime 
This Urban Bundle Me is one of the best baby items I've bought for my son! It's much more convenient than struggling to keep a blanket on the car seat. And if baby gets too warm just unzip the cover off! I like this version much better than the Original Bundle Me, which seems like it would get too warm for my baby. The material of the Urban Bundle Me is warm enough for rainy Washington weather but not too warm like the fleece in the Original Bundle Me. I also love the little pocket where I can store an emergency pacifier or other small items. It washes great and I plan to buy the larger toddler size once my son outgrows this. One minor problem is the zipper occasionally gets stuck, but that's to be expected when a zipper isn't zipped in a straight line. =) 
Well built, actually has padding in the bottom cushion (unlike all the others we looked at). If you want a comfortable ride for your infant, as well as the feeling you got your money's worth, get this one. I am so impressed I purchased a second one from Amazon 
I originally bought these bottles b/c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w/ this starter kit. I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer. My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle. I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her. I always found myself buying a few more of these. I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error. I also use these for storage from time to time w/ the addition of a sealing disc. It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack 
My friend is a recent mom, and she is so busy sometimes she has no time to clean bottles. Did her a favor and got her a pack, but you can still go through these on one day 
My baby has developed feeding issues including a unique mixture of colic and reflux that had made feeding times a nightmare for everyone in our house. We started out using the Playtex Drop-ins system and that worked fine for us until we were about 1.5 months old. Then suddenly there was lots of gas and screaming at feedings. I switched to the Playtex Vent Aire bottles and the screaming stopped, but there were issues with the nipples and that just wasn't working out for us either. Baby was spending more calories than she was taking in with level 1, and drowning with level 2. Plus there were wierd extra parts to clean and keep up with. It was a temporary answer to our prayers but still not what we were looking for. Because we have a preemie, changing her formula isn't an option because she needs the nutrients in this special formula we are giving her and she is continuing to gain weight. So the real issue has become trying to make feeding more comfortable for her and us. As a final resort (I had spent so much on bottle systems that didn't work out that I had almost given up), I gave the Avent feeding system a try. It has worked wonders. Baby eats in an appropriate amount of time now, there are only the standard parts on any bottle to clean and manage, baby tolerates the nipple and flow well (we use both level 1 and 2 nipples). Best of all are the special "Variable Flow" nipples, sold separately-we use those for feedings where we have to mix in rice cereal and they allow the cereal through, not too fast but no clogs either. I like not having to "alter" the flow of the regular nipples with toothpicks, etc. because once you do this, there's no going back. The Variable Flow nipples solve that problem and leave the other nipples unscathed for normal feeding needs. Also, our baby was addicted to the Soothie pacifiers at the hospital. We have tried Nuk, Mam, Gerber and she wouldn't accept any of those. But she is accepting the Avent pacifiers included with this newborn starter set. My advice to parents looking for bottles to help with/solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days. If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it. But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found "The Answer". Avent's bottles have passed this test for us and I would highly recommend them. Additionally, if your baby is experiencing colic and or reflux, see fussy baby dot org for tips and ideas. Also I would recommend a specific brand of gripe water called Colic Ease (all brands are not the same, see their ingredient page to see why). The fussy baby site and this gripe water teamed up with Avent bottles have really helped us out work through our feeding issues. Good luck 
We used Avent with our first son almost 5 years ago. I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle. I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely. After figuring this out, we had no more problems. We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again. Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems. Of course he was gassy at times, so I can't say he had no gas, but he didn't appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him. I really liked the wide bottle with Avent. It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold. Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves. The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands. The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard, but our son never had any problems taking it. Of course, this will vary amoung babies. After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby #2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for "extra soft nipple" and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago. If you are looking to save money, I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly. We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well. We never had to replace them. 
My daughter is a child with many developmental delays. At a year old she can only sit up with assistance. The bouncy seats are only meant to hold a child up to 25 lbs! Zoe still needed a chair to sooth and keep her out of harms way. I searched and found only two seats on the market. This one and the Fisher-price one. This one was perfect. Not only is it cushy and comfortable, it has many features. The toys on the side are convenient because my little can only reach to the side (instead of straight in front or overhead). Also, it is easier to lift her out because they don't get in the way. The variety of soothing sounds, levels of volume, and the vibrating features are all a wonderful addition to this rocker! This rocker is intended to be a long lasting item since it holds up to 40lbs. My three year old even sits in it from time to time! 
I love this rocker. It may not rock but keeps my son entertained for longer periods of time than any other item we have in the house. We leave him unbuckled and he scoots down onto his back and plays with his toys. He didn't like the toy bar so I purchased and attached a Tiny Love Toy Bar. He loves the octopus although he can pull it off and into himself. My 5 month old is near 20 lbs so I am very relieved that this rocker goes up to 40 lbs 
Our son was 3 months old and already 24 inches and 16 lbs. He outgrew his Fisher Price Papasan but it was his favorite. This chair is much bigger, he has plenty of room to grow still. It's easy to assemble, very solid in construction, plays great music and the volume can be adjusted. You can also hook up your ipod to it to play music. It doesn't fold down so transporting is not that easy 
our baby is only 5 days old, but so far it's a good carseat. i like the colors and design. it seems safe and easy to use 
We love the handle on this car seat. I owned a Graco Snug Ride and HATED it---it does not snap into a supermarket shopping cart. The handle is a triangle shape and you can carry it forward, backward, or against your hip. Love it, bought one with my second child and again for my last child when the first one expired 
Great seat. We read reviews somewhere complaining that their infant's head flopped forward in this seat. I installed it so that it was in a more reclining position while still being within the range- per the level indicator. We have had no trouble although we always support his head in the car seat so it cant flop around. 
According to consumer reports, this car seat is one of ONLY TWO car seats to pass all the crash tests. I highly suggest parents (and soon to be parents) to check out consumer reports before buying any car seats. And for the price it's worth it! 
The first time our son saw this toy he loved it. It made it much easier to transition him to the crib from his bassinette. It would be nice if the ocean sounds would play longer, like the music, but John really enjoys the music. 
Not your mama's crib toy. Vibrant rich colors and soothing yet upbeat music not at all annoying or elevator style. Wonderful addition to the nursery that will get you some extra sleep, I promise 
Pros: Great music, high/low volume choice, light show on ceiling a plus, my daughter loves to listen/watch it every night as she falls asleep! Cons: Strap broke after 2 moves (but if you contact Baby Einstein Co. they will send you a new one free of charge), wish it was just on/off (have to switch button for 1 song play vs. all songs to play) All in all, I like this because it works for my daughter. 
These are simply the best bottles. As far as the leaks go...you probably have the cap screwed down TOO tight...that is what happened to us...loosen it a little and voila...no more leaks. 
I have used lots of different bottles with my two kids. These bottles were by far the very best at venting to keep the air at a minimum in the babies tummy. Yes, they are a pain to wash but after switching to Evenflo glass bottles due to the plastic bottle scare currently in the news I have had tons of problems with Evenflo nipples. I have bought three different packages and all have at least one defective nipple in the package (they are not venting and the nipple collapes- supposedly they are designed not to do this). Evenflo is supposed to be sending me one replacement package but it still hasnt arrived! I havent told them yet about two more packages of nipples that also contain defective nipples. With all the pains of nipples collapsing while using glass bottles from Evenflo I think I would rather just go through the pain of washing the Dr Browns (our pediatrician said she had no concerns about the plastic bottle scares). I have never had a problem before with nipples collapsing in the Dr Browns or the Avent bottles I have used. Stay away from Evenflo as their Quality Assurance department is not even close to Dr Browns 
I LOVE THE DR. BROWN BOTTLES. THE BIGGER ONES ARE CLOSER TO BREAST SO ITS EASY TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH. I LIKE THE COMFORT GRIP ALSO 
My husband and I purchased Avent bottles for our newborn after doing our research for the best bottles in helping minimize gas, colic etc... Yikes! Needless to say, we were HIGHLY disappointed with Avent. By the recommendation of our pediatrician, we went out and bought a new set of Dr. Brown's bottles---kine of pricey, but WORTH every penny!! With Avent, my son was getting super gassy and colicky. He would cry so hard with gas pains that he'd clinch his little fists, crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse. Burping, mylicon and gripe water didn't even help. Our days and nights were sleepless--he wouldn't nap because he was crying--and our nights would average about 3-4 hours of sleep. Now, with Dr. Brown's---our son is a NEW little man. He STILL gets gas, but not like he did with the Avent bottles. All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he's out into LA LA land---he's now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6-8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks---and he's only 1 month old. :) For some reason, when he was feeding from the Avent, he would suck uncontrollably, I'd see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in. With Dr. Brown's, he has WAY more controlled sucking, it's much more rhythmic and no air bubbles in the nipple! MANY thumbs up for Dr. Brown's! 
These are the best bottles I have tried yet. The thing that makes them unique is that they really prevent the air bubbles from coming in better than any other bottle we've tried. The only negative I see is that there are several pieces which makes washing a bit of a nuissance - still, it's worth it if you have the patience to do a wash a day! 
Hi, I have no idea if these bottles help a colic/gasey baby. My baby was never like that. I considered these bottles because I hated that my son had to suck till he could suck no more then let go of a nipple so air could back into a regualar bottle. So I started looking for a bottle that didn't have nipple collaspe. First we tried Playtex. They worked but were extremely hard to mix powdered formula in because the liners held exactly 8 oz (also expensive liners). Then I switched to Avent, thought it was my dream come true bottle. Until they started leaking no matter how I screwed on the ring. I finally figured out the problem, the skirts on the nipples warp after very little use. So I ended up constantly buying new nipples and never knowing when we would get a whole bottle dumped on us. So then Dr Brown came out with these wide neck bottles. After some reading the directions and trial and error; this is it: The Bottle for Us!! This is how we did it; you can't use the valve while mixing formula or warming or the bottle will leak. So water goes in the bottle and just the ring, nipple and cap get screwed on. The valve goes in a zip-lock bag. About ten minuetes before the bottle is needed. I but the formula in the bottle in and shake. In about ten minuets all the bubbles are down and I incert the valve and feed. No leaks. I have an aunt who premixes her formuala in two days worth of bottles and puts them in the fridge ( once again leaving the valves out). Then she gets them out, swirls a little, takes off the top, microwaves for 30 secs, incerts valve, checks tempreture and feeds. No leaks either. The only time I have ever had a leak is when I mixed or heated formula with the valves in which the directions say not to do. Like I said this is what works best for us 
5 months old and no colic, no spit ups. These bottles are great. You could shake them and in seconds the bubbles disapear. While you feed your little one watch and be amazed as there are no bubbles. It takes a while to clean them. You just gotta do it when your little one is asleep 
The sheets were very soft after the first wash and they also fit the mattress well. The price was a good buy 
The lady below who said they dont fit her Eddie Bauer Pack n Play needs to realize Eddie Bauer is NOT a Pack N Play - Eddie Bauer is by Cosco and is considered just a play yard - all play yards are not considered equal. The name "Pack N Play" is exclusive to the brand and therefore these sheets fit just fine. Gave them four stars because they're not the most luxurious or long lasting sheets on the block, but they serve their purpose and fit just fine 
It's easier to keep a sheet clean than try to keep cleaning the cushion of the pack 'n play. I'll admit that the workmanship on this sheet isn't top notch, but it serves its purpose. If I were interested in sewing, I could make one that looks just as good as this one, but I don't/won't sew. Got a second sheet for the pack 'n play at Grandma's house. Gotta have a sheet 
I found this sheet to work very well with my pack n play pad. It just slips over the bottom and it stays on very well. I don't know about for other play pens, but this is a great product for use with the Pack n' play 
I have a 9 month old (22 lbs). She likes sitting in this, and it works just fine. Has not leaked yet, and being able to hang it up on the wall when not using it is very helpful. No one can say it's not worth the money 
How do I count the ways? This tub is GREEEEEAT! I had a little trouble at first trying to inflate it since it indicates to only use your mouth but all the effort was worth it. It's very light and the suction hook latches on to the bathroom title for future use. 
Although my 11 month old son was terrified of this tub at first, he is used to it now and loves it! He did not enjoy taking a bath before I bought the tub, and now that he likes the Ducky tub, he has a blast taking a bath! I would recommend this product 
This is a great tub for any baby able to sit up on their own. It is the perfect size with room for your little one to grow. It not only saves on water you would use to fill a larger tub but gives your little one a sense of security. When i tried our baby in the big tub he cried and didnt like it so i tried him back in his infant tub and he was fine. I realized it was a matter of security for him. The large tub was just so over-whelming. He loves to squeek the duck and play with tossing rings. Price is just right to! Just be careful when you inflate tub because it inflates in sections. My husband used an air compressor thinking it was all one compartment to fill with air and it blew up 
My daughter loves this tub. She moves a lot and it is nice to know she won't hurt herslef on a hard plastic tub. She loves to bite the duck and play with the rings. I have not had any problems with this tub at all. Blowing it up is the hardest part. Takes a lot of breath. I recommend it to anyone. It is worth the money. I plan to use it with all future kids as well 
This is a wonderful product for infants not quite ready for an adult tub, but too big for a baby tub. I love how it fits perfectly into the regular tub, so it's easy to fill/drain and will make an easier transition for when my son becomes too big for it. My son loves playing with the rings and seems to be very comfortable. My brother is super-picky, but after seeing my son's tub he bought one for his daughter 
I have 3 of these (yellow, blue, and green). 3 was plenty, 1 being used, 1 being laundered, and 1 extra just in case. My son's is now 20 months old and they are still in great condition. He no longer uses a changing pad, but there is lots more use left in them for younger siblings. They did shrink up a little after being washed and are a little tight on the changing pad. Other than that they are great 
This product is very thick and absorbent, like a top of the line towel. I recommend every mother to pick up a few of these....a must have for changing pads! 
I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place. As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually 
This is the third one that we've purchased. Of all the child safety gates we've seen, this seems to be the sturdiest of the bunch. We've been using them for 2 1/2 years and are very satisfied. The trick is to align the closing point so that it will latch when you swing the gate closed. If its not aligned, the gate will bounce back. 
I loved the hand's free gate but had just a little too big opening. The extension is very easy to install and sturdy. Would recommend if you like the gate but have larger door openings 
The "baby" gate and extensions were fantasticly easy to install and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The extensions were added in mere seconds. This was a perfect choice to keep my dog out of an area that he was not allowed into 
I love this gate/gate extension. This is the best one I've ever used. I've been through nieces, nephews, step-nephews, and now a great nephew and of all gates that have been used in our families this is by far the best one. It's convenient and very sturdy. You cannot go wrong with this product. This will last a very long time 
If you need the gate extension, this thing is great -- it's super-easy to install. Unfortunately, if you tighten the nuts too far, the gate itself is a pain to open and close. Overall though, a great purchase 
we have a big gap before our bedroom, and we needed in fact 2 of these extensions to make our gate fit. now with one, it seemed it would be sturdy, but with 2 extension, it gets a little flimsy and the whole gate can fall off the wall if you press the foot pedal too hard or shove the gate by mistake.. 
We bought two of these extensions for the Hands Free Gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old. This gate including extensions are a lifesaver! You can read my review on the gate as well, lol. The extensions are very easy to add and very sturday. Adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do. It is just what it states, an extension. It keeps it just as strong as sturdy! Worth the money 
Works great. Easy to use. Just a bit costly but worth the money 
We switch to this warmer from a very disappointed First year Night and Day warmer. This one at least will not burn our hands when taking out the bottle. The water inside will not come to boiling point. It will still overheat the bottle if you leave the bottle for too long. The light does not seem to be helpful. It keeps the temperate at too high level. However compare to the First year one, you do not have to be precisely accurate at the water level (which was a pain when you use the First year one at 3AM with your sleepy eyes) and you will not get a mess of water around the table, so I'd recommend this product. Also, the warmer kind of make a 'tick' noise when it is on so it becomes a reminder that the warmer is still on, which is a good thing 
It may seem expensive but this warmer is absolutely worth it! I B/F most of the time and only heat a couple of bottles a day but its so simple and doesnt take much time. The light goes out when its warm enough and your ready to feed your baby! I absolutely love it 
My husband and I received this warmer at our baby shower and while it was great to not have to walk downstairs to warm the bottles for early morning feedings, after Sofia hit 5 months, we never used it again. She's 9 months old now and it sits on a shelf in her nursery waiting for baby #2. I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I'd give it as a gift. I say that because it'll get more mileage than the typical cute outfit and will cost the same. 
I give my baby frozen breastmilk and have used this warmer to get the milk ready for her. It works great. I just pop in the bottle fill the warmer with water and wait 4 minutes (5 oz bottles) and voila! milk is warm but not hot. 
We bought one of these quilted sacks (along with a fleece one and a cotton one) when our daughter was born in the winter. It felt like we were Goldilocks....the fleece kept our baby too warm, the cotton kept her too cold, but the quilted sack was just right. As another reviewer said, the fabric can be a big "clingy", however, it is just a slight annoyance and the benefits far outweigh the irritation. (Besides, I found that the fleece ones are extremely static-y and and cotton sacks wrinkle into a little ball in the dryer.) 
I ordered the Sleep Sack from a friends gift registry. She was very pleased with it, let me know right away when she got it 
We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics. They are all terrific. We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall. I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
This is a neat little spout cover. The hat on the duck lifts so you can pour the bubble bath into it, so it slowly drizzles to make alot of bubbles. would recommend 
This ducky is so cute, and really useful! I got it for my daughter when she transitioned into the big tub. I love that you can lift his shower cap and get LOTS of bubbles right out of the faucet! My daughter, who is 6 months old, is fascinated by the ducky, and I feel safe with her grabbing at the faucet and getting close to it, now! I had a little trouble getting the duck to fit over my faucet, but I just soaked it in hot water for a few seconds, and it went on very easily! GREAT PRDUCT! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!! 
We wanted a ducky theme for our son's bathroom. We got this and the Ducky Tub Rug, Jr. This ducky spout guard is cute and does it's job. The bubble bath dispenser works, too (my husband and I like to use that! 
The product was exactly as decsribed, quality materials, fits perfect, and what child doen't want a rubber ducky in the tub area 
This product is perfect for preemies! The smaller head rest is prefect for preemies and newborns. The larger headrest can be uses for many months after the smaller head rest is removed. It is SUPER soft! Is is chenille and very cozy for baby's skin 
This Tub is Great! I love that it fits right in my sink for easy baths and clean ups, and then it folds small enough to put under the sink 
This tub is fabulous! We love that it is just as simple as can be...no bells and whistles...just a great sturdy tub. It folds up so as not to take up much room when stored, has an opening in the bottom to drain water out, fits great in the kitchen sink and holds baby in a great position for bathing. We use it with one of those yellow bear spongy thingies, and baby is supported, semi-reclined and very, very comfy! Worth every penny 
I love it. It works well with the car seat and even their bouncers. Great to have for the outdoors 
This was a great addition to my Medela [...] pump (along with the car adapter). When I pump at work, it frees my hands to do other things. It may take a few extra seconds to attach, but worth it. The only drawback are the hooks that attach to the bra. They easily fall off when not in use. I have to remember to take them off and put them somewhere safe 
I love this product. I've been EP-ing for my preemie for 6+ months now and have kept my sanity because of this product. I've tried other hands free methods like using my nursing bra flap to keep it in place (doesn't work for me) and the Easy Expressions Bustier which a lot of people love, but I didn't because it compressed my rib cage and made my back ache. Not a pleasant experience. You do need a Medela nursing bra, but I love their bras too 
It's so nice to know you have ever thing you might need, even if you don't wind up using it all. Although I've used most of these products already, and my little one is only 9 months old. Plus, the handy plastic carrying case is has plenty of extra room so I can keep ALL of her health stuff in one easy to grab place, which is super nice when you're being a freaked-out Mommy with her first baby sick for the first time, so you can easily tell Daddy what to bring you, and then just sit down and look at everything and figure out what can help her 
Beware that this product does not contain normal sized medicines. They are only 1/2 oz bottles of gas drops, saline drops, acetomeniphen, and decongestant, and only 3/16 oz of teething gel. You will go through any of these medications VERY quickly. But that is probably why the kit costs $20 instead of J's $40 one. It is good to have this stuff for emergencies when you don't know what you will need ahead of time. My baby LOVED the taste of the gas drops, but we used up the bottle in a week unfortunately. The Little Fevers was wonderful to bring along to her first shots but didn't last much longer than that. The nasal aspirator is wonderful... so much easier on her nose than the hospital one! It also has a clear tip so you can see when it needs to be clean out. I wish it came with an electrolytes packet too, but I guess you can't have everything. It was worth $20 to have (almost) everything you need at your fingertips, but I wish I didn't have to replace the medicines so soon. I would still recommend this over the J kit since you never know what you'll need and what you won't use. 
The container is hokey and we tossed it, but it's a great value for all the products inside. The fever reducer/pain relief drops (just like Tylenol) don't taste too good, but they work. It's a nice gift and gives a new parent reassurance they'll have what they need in an emergency. 
I'm not a big fan of giving pharmeceuticals to infants, but this line is somewhat 'natural' or as homeopathic as you can get in commercial stores. I used the gas drops religously for both my kids and it really helped with what I call 'colic'. I also use the nose suction and the fingernail clippers--theirs is the best from what I could find. I will give this warning: If you are buying for another person, make sure you check the expiration date. If their baby is not due for a while, you better get one with a later expiration date. This happened to me, BRU had one with an expiration date of two months ahead, so there was no way the person I bought if for could keep it. I felt bad b/c I didn't notice it while I was in the store, and being a new parent, I'm sure it was a challenge for them to return it before they needed to use it. Just a warning 
I bought this item for my daughter and her new baby. The baby is 8 days old and we have already used several of the products in the kit. They have come in very handy and I very glad I purchased this product for my daughter 
My friend bought this for me because she swore by it with her son. It is excellent. First of all, I must say, the Gas Drops are just amazing. My daughter had so many problems with colic and gas and I used them all the time. They work wonders. The saline drops are great for the winter during cold season. I have already had to repurchase a few of the items. The case is great because it keeps everything in one place so I don't have to search for stuff. 
I find these to be quite convenient for giving my baby breastmilk from the bottle. With the Playtex One-Step storage system, I pump directly into the liner and stick it in the fridge, and then I can pop it in a nurser when it's time to feed. My husband and other caregivers are quite glad at the ease of putting it all together when they're juggling a crying baby. As advice to others, I wonder whether the original nurser gift set might be better, because it comes with multiple different kinds of nipples, whereas this set only comes with the silicone slow flow. We've lucked out, in that my baby seems happy with it and switches easily from breast to bottle and vice versa; however, it might have been handy to be able to try different kinds to see which the babe likes best. The shells in this set are more modern looking, but I can't see how that matters. I'm pretty sure the pieces for both are interchangeable. Nice that the silicone nipples in this set (and all the other pieces; latex nipples are less hardy) are dishwasher safe, and can be repeatedly boiled for sterilization if desired. The short shells in this set are fine, and it's easier to reach in the bottom to squish the liner with your fingers (to help it collapse; the drop-in liners are relatively more shape-holding than regular liners, so they can suck in air), but usually my baby has more than 4 oz at a sitting; in the 8oz size shell, the burper is nice (it's hard to reach in when the liner is less full), but it doesn't squish the liner all the way, so we end up taking off the shell and using our fingers for the last 2 oz or so. I have never had any problem with leaking. I like the disposable bit of this system, since the nipples, collars, and lids take up enough space and cleaning effort without having a bunch of bottles around as well. Liners are pricy if you use a lot (about $5 for 50 at Walgreens), but since we only use a bottle a day, it doesn't seem like much. They also freeze easily. This set came with one adapter for a breast pump (I use an Ameda Purely Yours, and they fit together perfectly), and the One-Step comes with another, so I can use the double pumping without buying any other pieces. Overall, I'm very happy with this set 
These bottles are the BEST! I am breastfeeding but due to medical issues, we had to give our baby a bottle from the beginning and she took this one with no problem. She switches back and forth between bottle and nursing and is great! This bottle system is SO easy to use. It's easy to put a bottle together quickly and they transport well, so they're perfect for using on the go too. I love them! 5 stars 
After doing our pre-baby research, we registered for and received this set. We started using it with no problems, and then my daughter started having problems with gas. Naturally, we blamed it on the bottles. Many bottles and wasted dollars later, we returned to the Premium Nursers and have never looked back. In fact, the more I watch other moms with other bottles, the happier I am. Sure, you spend a few extra bucks on liners. But the time and energy and dishwasher costs you save are well worth it. We have 4 bottle shells that we use and about 10 nipples. The shells rarely get dirty and so rarely have to be washed. Likewise for the rings and caps. We usually run a load of nipples with the dishwasher every day and that's it. Empty liners pop out with no mess and are recyclable to boot. When we go out, I pack 1 pre-assembled bottle, and an extra liner and nipple/ring/cap setup. It weighs nothing and takes up way less space than multiple bottles. On the fly I can just pop out the dirty liner, throw it away, pop in the new one and screw on the new top. As an added bonus - I think my husband may actually have invented this ingenius use for the Premium Nurser. Note: this can only be done with the Playtex brand liners, not generics. When my daughter was struggling with swallowing too much air, my husband figured out that we could fill the liner with the desired amount of milk, screw on the nipple, and then squeeze all of the air out of the liner, collapsing it down until it was vacuum-tight with only milk in it. Keeping a finger over the nipple hole, pop on the airtight cap. Voila - a completely air-free meal for baby. This really helped cut back on her air swallowing. Generic liners work fine for all other purposes. Last but not least, we like so many other parents, felt that many brands were drowning our daughter in milk. The Playtex slow- flow nipples worked great for her. She is still using them at 4 months 
I originally got the Avents, and they were awful...leaked, nipples were terrible, etc. I got the Playtex Nursers and my daughter loves them. She prefers the latex nipples, though. 
My husband and I have tried many different bottle types and brands and have decided that these are the best. My 6 week old daughter adjusted well to them. The original brown nipples wear out very quickly but, the silicone ones are much nicer and will last longer. These bottles are very easy to use and clean. My husband prefers the soft bottle liners over the preformed dropins. The soft ones haven't leaked on us once but the formed ones have slipped out from under the ring a couple of times spilling formula everywhere. The formed ones also make it harder to screw the lid on tight enough causing leaks. The soft liners might take a little bit longer to put on the bottle and deal with, but in the long run it takes less time because you don't have to go change your clothes every time the preformed ones leak. They are worth every penny I spent on them. Even though they may cost more than standard bottles because of having to buy the liners, they help prevent gas and colic. THey are absolutely wonderful 
Buy more and stack higher if you need the capacity. Takes up less counter space this way. Sturdy and well designed. Comes with extender feet so you can have short or tall levels when stacking. Easily unstacks for ease of loading bottle parts. 
I was so happy with my purchase that I bought one for my baby nephew. 
This is the BEST product for keeping your child warm when strolling around in cold weather. It's like wrapping him/her up in a cozy sleeping bag. Our son loves it and so do we. It's been wonderful for our little boy (bought at 8mo) however he's a very tall infant (28" at the time, 30" now at 9.5mo). I question whether this product will work for him as a toddler since he's already in 18mo-old clothing. This is why we skipped the infant size. Also, don't purchase this product thinking it will completely cover your child. It comes up to their upper chest. The child will still need to wear a coat/hat/mittens. The flap does come higher, however our son doesn't like to have it pulled up and fights it. All-in-all, this product does what we purchased it for 
We got this for our son when he was 1 yr old, and it looks brand new, a year later. Our child is of average size, and he's got plenty of room in it, at age 2. We live in a major city, so our stroller gets A LOT of use. This blanket is very durable, grows with your child, and keeps them warm and comfy in the coldest temperatures. Stays in place, and is easy to install/remove 
I've been using the Big Bundle Me for my 28 month old since he was 16 months, and haven't had any trouble getting him to fit in it comfortably. We use is all the time when we go out, and he loves being in it. It works great in the Jogger Stroller 
This surround gate is great for my 10 month old daughter. It is sturdy, easy to move, and it has a lot more room than your traditional playpen. My husband and I both like how easy it is to open the door and sit inside the play space with our daughter at times. I also look forward to using it outside this summer. It will be lage enough to put around her sandbox I'm sure. I would recommend this sorround gate to anyone 
I bought this item for my mom. She has two small dogs that she keeps inside. She uses four of the panels to make a dog enclosure. It keeps the dogs from jumping all over guests in the house. It works great 
i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish 
I love the Bundle Me lite. I live in CA so it's perfect for those "cold" days. I have a heavier one for the snow but still haven't used that yet. The lite is wonderful, I put it on I don't worry about blankets slipping off and getting dirty. The top zips right off so when it's warm and not needed you don't have to mess with taking the whole thing off. And it is super soft. I wish I had this with my first two babies. My third's the one that lucked out 
not exactly for your little little ones. this is a type of toy for a baby who is ready to explore. but otherwise great fun toy and it smells good too 
I didn't realize the tentacles were horns when I purchased it-- I thought they were electric touch-sensors. I like the horns much more since batteries are not required and I know it will not break easily. My 4-month old son cannot squeeze the tentacles to make the noises (yet) but I'm having so much fun playing it for him! He loves the different textures and colors of the fabrics. I've already purchased two more for friends... this toy is a bargain at $10! It's definitely worth much more. 
We received this today and when I showed it to my 7 month old, it brought a HUGE grin to his face and a squeal of delight! This is an adorable toy that is so bright and eye catching, along with a delightful vanilla scent. The horn noises that the tentacles make also bring a huge smile to my sons face and will be fun to experiment with the different tones and song producing sounds. I am ordering 2 more for baby gifts for a friend and family member! 
This is a great booster seat so far! It's light and east to carry and my son loves it. I like the fact that it folds in half and when we travel it will be easy to handle. Also, great price on such a great seat 
We have twins and my son is growing a little faster then my daughter. When it became time for a booster seat we made a great choice. This seat is easy to adjust as he grows, easy to install and wrap the seatbelt through, sits firmly on contoured seats and is very easy to clean. I must admit that one of the features that helped me to decide on buying this seat was the interactive video that showed how it worked. I like this seat so much that I am now buying the same seat for my daughter. You will be very happy with this important purchase 
We comparison-shopped for booster seats for a while, and found this to be greatly superior to anything we've used in the past. The price is higher than other booster-only seats (with no lateral head support), but the additional safety factor is well worth it. This is the second of this model that we bought, so now both active boys (4 and 7) are ensconced in them 
I would highly recommend this booster for parents as their children reach the proper height and weight. It's comfortable, light and easy to maneuver. Being able to put the straps across the child at the proper height (adjustable by the way) is extremely important for their safety - and since you can use the straps in the car, they go right over bulky winter clothing without having to readjust like our old seat. I would strongly encourage people to remember to belt the seat in even when no one is using it. It could become quite a projectile during an accident if not secured 
I bought this booster to replace our Graco Turbobooster because I drive a Jeep Cherokee Sport w/ a very low back bucket seat (no headrests either). I feel my daughter (5 yrs. old) has more support because the whole back raises for height adjustment (not just the headrest). I've also heard that Compass will replace our booster seat if we are in an accident. We are both very happy. 
This booster seat is exactly what we needed for our three year old son. It is easy to move from either side of the car, the drink holder is deep enough to keep his drinks from spilling, and most important my son is very safe and comfortable 
I purchased this booster seat for my middle child. She is very tiny, so I didnt want a seat with no back. This seat is very padded, very comfortable, and she loves the arm rests that flip up and down. I had done some research before purchasing, and this seat was rated well. It rated well for safety and comfort. It is also easy to install and light weight. 
When trying to decide what we needed and didn't need for our daughter, I knew we needed something to contain diapers. We had no desire to trek out to the trash can at every change (especially those first weeks at all hours of the day and night!). Basically for me it came down to Diaper Genie or the Diaper Dekor. I considered the price of refills, reviews, and the advice of a friend who works in daycare and went with the Diaper Dekor. We love it!!! It has done a wonderful job and the refills have lasted longer than I would have ever imagined. The dekor came with one fill- and we've not gone through an entire box of refills yet. Our daughter is 7 months old now, she's eating solids and some of those diapers are pretty nasty. However, a quick change and drop into the Dekor and no more smell. Plus, it is just as easy to toss in wipes and other related trash items instead of wasting refills or tracking it through the house. The ONLY time we've ever had a smell-- is when we've had it open and the inner doors open to put in another diaper. As soon as it closes-- no more smell. Those who swear by their Diaper Genies-- I don't think it is an accident that the recent redesign of the DG basically resembles the DD in design and function. I personally think we'll get a lot more use out of the DD down the line. I highly recommend the Diaper Dekor for your nursery!! 
So far our new Diaper Dekor has done the job. It is easy to use and the bag refills are simple. It has only been a month or so sice we started using it but it has been a huge difference in the smell factor of the nursery 
We've been using our Diaper Dekor for more than two years now. In all that time, the Dekor has held up wonderfully. After hearing friends complain about the two-handed requirements of Diaper Genies and the like, we went with the Dekor because the easy, one-handed operation was appealing -- just stomp on the pedal and throw in the diaper. We were also glad that the product was so well-reviewed; it turns out that those good ratings are very well deserved. Our Dekor works so well that we keep it in the family room, where we spend most of our time (bonus: we don't have to run upstairs every time we need to change a diaper!) -- and we certainly wouldn't do that if there were an odor problem. The only time we've noticed any odor has been during the summer, when it's really hot and the contents get... ah... ripe faster, and even then it was only when the lid was open. Other than a few super-hot weeks each year, we empty the Dekor once a week and all is well. The interior of the Dekor, where the diapers are collected, has gotten a touch stinky over the last couple years, but you don't smell it until you open the door to empty the unit. A little Lysol helps, but frankly, as long as the smell doesn't "escape" the Dekor, it's a non-issue to us -- and so far, so good! The refills may seem more expensive than other systems, but they last FOREVER. With my first son, we used only four refills in two years. I highly recommend the Dekor, and wouldn't even consider another diaper disposal system. Hope you're as happy with it as we are 
I used diaper genie with my last child it was horrid! This diaper dekor is a wondeful must have product! I would recomend it to every parent looking for a disposal system. There really are no diaper smells, it holds tons of diapers and is easy to use. Get this my husband changes the bag for me as well as using it to dispose of diapers. I mainly chose it due to the great reviews, believe them this is the best system out there. I hear the bigger one is great too, I bought this smaller model due to limited space in my house and figured it would add nicely to my bathroom once baby is out of diapers 
We looked at many carseats before we chose this one. 1st of all, we wanted safe. The seat got good reviews and had a safe harness system. The seat was also affordable. The pattern was cute and neutral, good for boys or girls. It did take some work to install the base but I think all seats would be similar. It was a good purchase. We especially enjoy the matching stroller that will hold 2 carseats. This has been a blessing with twins 
After searching and searching for the "perfect" car seat (that was still affordable) we found the Graco Snugride. It is easy to install, after you buckle the seatbelt just make sure you pull your seatbelt all the way out until you hear your "autolock" kick in and then slowly release the seatbelt back in. Once it is back in your seatbelt will hold the seat in place without the testher strap. My daughter has been using this car seat for 6 months now and I haven't had an issue with it. It's easy to take in and out of the base with or without my daughter in it. I love the 5 point safety points on it, it makes me feel like she is truly as safe as she can be, and as she grows it is easy to adjust the straps 
Having spent money on other stroller shields that would fly away with a gust of wind, I was so happy that this one did not let me down. It is extremely secure since it has a couple of velcro straps that are actually stitched to the shield (thank you)that keep the shield in place. Others come with stickers that come right off but not this one. It actually covers the stroller all the way. Right now I am using a stroller system carriage that has a car seat in it, so it is kind of bulky, but this shield actually covers the stroller down to the foot rest and down the back behind the handles. The roominess is excellent. The cool pop up part is what makes it easier to put on too. It's a bit tricky at first to close it since you have to twist it a certain way in order to do so, but it is well worth the effort. No more fly aways and awkward folding. 
This fits all my strollers and is a plus to have if you live in a rainy area 
I must say I am truely impressed...and that is not the usual for me...I popped it open and it just beamed at me...so it looks good. It fit on both versions of my babies strollers the full size and the light weight umbrella canopy stroller. The velcro straps let you adjust tightness of the fit and secure it to the handles and legs of the stroller!No more fly aways!!!. The only thing I could see making it not 100% full proof is the blue material that makes the roof...but even that repelled most of the water when I sprinkled it kind of like windbreaker jacket material....but doesnt the roof of your stroller get wet when it rains regardless?!Sure it does!If you dont want to get wet at all Stay Out of The Rain!With that said I must give this wonderful Product the Big Mommy Approval Stamp 
We use this storage and feeding set every day. We bought other feeding bottles, but having the breastmilk in these bottles for sure creates convenience with great speed. We use these to store the milk in the freezer and/or fridge, and then whenever baby is hungry daddy or/and sitter simply attaches the nipple and cap, places bottle in bottle-warmer and - voila - it's all ready in a matter of a few mins. No fuss transferring milk from freezer bags into bottles. Also, because nipple is on the bottle when bottle placed in the warmer, the nipple gets all warm and supple, which our baby prefers (rather than having a cold/harder nipple) 
This is really handy with the mini electric pump that I have. I can pump straight into the bottles. I just use the bottle occasionally so this item works great for me. The nipples are a fast flow so the first time I fed my baby, the milk flow was too fast. I just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples and it's perfect for my baby. 
I have never had problems with these bottles leaking if stored correctly. I use the discs with the nipples when traveling so that I don't need the full caps except for storage. Honestly I don't use these to freeze, because it would be too expensive. I use the Lansinoh bags for that and these work great for the fridge and shorter term storage. The strange little nipples are the first ones that help my son with a latching problem. He always sucked air when he fed, that is no problem with these, and are really the only reason I buy this product as opposed to other less expensive bottles for storage 
I purchased this set to use with my Medela double pump and have found it quite satisfactory to my needs. The bottles fit the pump perfectly, are durable enough to be sterilized as needed and, most importantly, keep my frozen milk fresh and safe in the freezer. The nipple rings, disc caps, and solid caps have all worked well. As for the orthodontic nipple, my son has accepted it from the start and we've had no reason to try another brand (although the milk does come out a little bit too fast in my opinion). I can't imagine having any trouble with this storage and feeding set if you are using a Medela pump. 
This is an excellent double bedrail, and once it is put together, it is very easy to remove, resize, put on another bed, etc. We have another double bedrail that folds for travel but getting it to fit under the mattress is a pain. The First Years rail makes that adjustment easy. But be prepared - it comes COMPLETELY apart and takes tools, patience, and time to put together. Our other bedrail was much easier to put together 
Our toddler recently moved into a "big boy" bed and was falling out of bed numerous times at night. We originally bought a single bed rail but found we needed a double sided bed rail because we can't have his bed against the wall because he kicks the wall and wakes us up throughout the night. I actually like the positioning of double rail better than the single because it clamps onto the bottom of the mattress rather than the top which leave more room on the bed. It's easy to change sheets because the rails drop down. The last part of assembling the sides with fabric (getting the screws in the correct place) was a little difficult, probably easier with two people but other than that, very easy to assemble. We are very pleased with this purchase 
I bought this sling after reading the different reviews on this page. After reading the instructions a lot of the problems others had were taken care of. For one thing when you use it as a sling the letter "P" will turn over and face your shoulder. To make sure the cord stopper does not loosen the instructions tells you to tie a knot in the remaining length of the cord. My son loves to be held. We were in Children's hospital for 10 days and I held him a lot to keep the monitors from going off. So now he loves me to still hold him. This sling allows me to hold him and do other things. One important thing is to play with my 3 year old son. 
i got this for my second kid, and i would be going crazy without it! my baby is too small(6 1/2lbs) for my baby bjorn(8lbs min.) which i used for my toddler when he was a baby. i can go anywhere, do anything while wearing it, and my toddler can have my full attention while i'm keeping my baby close. it is so easy to breastfeed in, no adjustments needed like the bjorn, and no one can even tell! my toddler at 30lbs even enjoys a ride sometimes for fun! and those who complain about pain should first put the strap over the shoulder bone, not the muscle, and then realize that you are still carrying a baby on your body and the sling won't make the weight disapear! when my toddler is in it, i'm still carrying 30 lbs but it's spread over my body, not just my arms and hip! i have not had any problems with the straps loosening, and it fits me perfectly and i'm 5'6". i highly recomend it, just realize that it may take getting used to if you aren't used to carrying weight on your back. this sling is awesome and it doesn't make me feel like a hippi 
Not great to lay your infant inside, but ok if you leave it closed and slide it under baby for extra support. You can't let go of your baby this way, but it works great when your baby has already fallen asleep and you need something to support their weight. If you are carrying your child on your hip, you could slip it under their heiny to support their weight. It's a quick fix for tired arms but, it doesn't free you up completely 
This was a gift for my neice. She is a new mom and just loves it 
I would whole heartedly recommend this product. I tried the diaper Genie and could never figure out how to change out the bag, or hardly how to use the thing. With the Diaper Dekor, I pulled it out of the box and it was ready to go. When it was time to change the liner (which does last a LONG time, I was shocked) it was very straight forward. It didn't even require reading the directions (who has time for that when you have a baby after reading all of the parenting books and other safety manuals). It is a bit more expensive, but definitely worth the extra $10 for the hands free and bag changing ease. Plus, if the diapers sit in it for less than a week it really doesn't start smelling very much, but go over a week and you will start to smell it 
My daughter is 3 and we are working hard on potty training! I got this as a gift when i was pregnant and I love it! There is an occasional smell I noticed if I let the bag fill up too much. But that is simple just empty it more often. I like that the refill bags last a long time. I do admit that I do sometimes put poopy diapers inside another bag before I put it in the daiper pail (just to make sure it won't smell. In the 3 threes I have had it I have only brought 5 refill packages and in comparism to diaper genie that is nothing. The refill packages were a little pricey (my local Toys R Us sells for 9.95 a box)but it is worth it and like I said,they last! My daughter knows to take her pull up off when it is bath time and she throws it in the dekor diaper pail without touching anything. I wouldn't want the diaper genie where I have to change something every other day-I dump mine out once a week-love it 
My sister had the Genie, my best friend had Diaper Champ, another friend used Neat! and because of my/their experience with all three, we chose this for our registry. I'm so glad we did. Yes, when it is full, some odor will come out when you dispose of another, but compared to the others that omit odor without touching it, this one is by far the best. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to remove the bag because I couldn't find directions anywhere, but once I realized there was a blade to cut it, then tie a knot, it's been smooth sailing. Love it 
Strange title, I know, but keep reading and you'll understand it perfectly. First of all, the liners last a long time and are easy to use and refill. I really like how there is a very handy and very child safe cutting blade for the liners mounted onto the inside of the lower changing door. I noticed some reviewers stating that they had problems with the item controling odor, while most other's have had no trouble at all. Taking this into account, I purchased my Diaper Dekor with an open mind. I had no trouble for the first 5 months. Then I also noticed an odor in my son's room, even when the unit was empty, and after I had wiped down the outter lid, inner lid, and flaps, inside and out. Then it occured to me: There was condensation on the inside of the liner bag when I emptied it and then used the blade to cut it. I wondered if maybe the bacteria or something from the moisture was now on the blade and then causing the smell. So, I pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto the blade to see what would happen. The smell went away. I then thought, "That's just too easy, and a bit crazy. It can't be that simple". So, I waited until I noticed the smell again a couple of months later. I used the hand sanitizer again, and lo and behold, the smell once again went away. The gist of it is, if you're going to put a wast material into something where it's going to sit for a few days before you get rid of it, it is going to start to decompose. The Diaper Dekor is great at controlling those icky germs and bacteria and keeping them in one safe place. The problem is, decomposisition creats heat, and the more decomposing solid matter, and the longer is sits, the warmer it all becomes. So, if the temperature inside your waste recepticle is warmer (which it will be) than the surrounding room temperature, condensation will form. So when you cut the liner to empy the unit, clean the blade. No odor. No problems 
This product is pretty good. The sound sensitivity is very high and the volume is adjustable so you can choose a threshold you feel comfortable. Only con is that the battery of child system didn't last very long each recharge, like 3 to 4 hours. You'd better keep it plugged if you use it overnight 
The Evenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz 2-Way Nursery Monitor is our second Whisper Conect Monitor. Compared to the already good one way 900MHz model this one is even more sensitive, has a lower noise level, longer lasting rechargeable NiMH batteries and the 2 way mode can save you a lot of walking if your child only needs to hear your voice. Strong recomendation 
I have a 3 year old upstairs and we have a downstairs master. She wakes up in the morning and yells for us to come get her. She doesn't get out of bed or her room. It's great for us to be able to tell her we'll be there in a minute, or to read a book or something so she doesn't increasingly get louder and wake up her sister!! We really are happy with it. Suits our needs perfectly 
I love using the system. It is great to be upstairs and not have to really yell. The monitor allows us to tell them we are coming to help them. They know that we are on the way to help them or scare away the monsters at night 
I didnt have a monitor with my son so I wasnt sure what to expect. I thought there would be a lot more background snow but there isn't it is very clear. We have a vaporizer running all the time in there but when my daughter cries, her voice is very clear through the vaporizer sounds. The only thing is that I wish the monitor was a little more portable, maybe a battery backup. A minor inconvenience. The 2-way speaker is awesome. When I shower and she starts to cry, I can calm her with a little conversation and get a couple minutes to dry off. 
I'm so happy with this item! Even though my son is almost three this is our first baby monitor. I did a lot of research and finally purchased this one because it could be used as a walkie-talkie, had rechargeable batteries, and had a large range. We have a big yard so the freedom is nice. It works well with little feedback. 
I tried a few different monitors in my home and this works great. I live in a condo building so was worried about static and interference but none so far. Works great 
In person this blanket is very cute and very soft and it perfectly matches all the other items in the Zanzibar line. The two giraffe design you see in the picture above is embroidered on the lower right hand corner of the blanket and other than the caramel colored ultrasuede hem around the edges, it is the only design. The dimentions of the blanket are not listed above but it is 29" by 39" and has a slight amount of stretch pulling it across the width but doesn't have any stretch pulling it across the length. This makes the blanket easy to use for swaddling an infant. It's made of 100% polyester but you'd never know it by the feel. It looks and feels just like the softest fluffy fleece yet when you wash the blanket it doesn't shrink. The care instructions are machine wash cold separately and tumble dry low. Do not iron or use bleach. 
This is the fleece blanket that matches the Zanzibar set. It is really soft and is a great edition to this line. I love it 
I recommend this bathtub,but not for everyday use.I bought this product to take with us when travelling and staying in hotels.For this it is a great bathtub.It folds easily and is light.I took it with us in our suitcase..a little bulky,but it did fit.I was very happy I did not need to use the hotel bathtub for my baby 
We tried a couple different solutions to the "head-flop" problem in the newborn's carseat. These worked best. They're easy to adjust even when they're closed (the velcro is very strong) which is a plus when you don't want to wake the baby up 
These are so soft and cushy for my sweet darling's face. They are great for the cold weather too! I suggest getting them early on to help for head support as well but my daughter is now 5 months old and I just love them for the comfort and warmth 
This product is great! my daughter (29 months) loved it at first glance. The duckies are cute and the size is perfect. It is a cushie seat that is secure and comfortable. She won't use any other toilet. I also have the first years' seat with the handles on the sides, but this one is far superior. The First Years one was about the same price, but the foam part is flimsy and separates easily from the base, and it does not stay put- once my daughter even fell in to the toilet water from shifting her weight around on it! This seat is a great value, and it also has a nice hook that you can put on the wall for quick switches from potty to adult toilet 
I have had 4 potty's, this is by far the BEST one. I even bought the Baby Bjorn thinking it would be the best which was wrong. This is the only potty that prevents my son from leaking without a hard deflector to hurt his thighs. I will admit that he really liked his Elmo seat (which had a horrible deflector among other things) so I bought Elmo stickers and stuck them to the very outer edges on the sides and so now he loves this seat as well, sometimes it takes a lot of time waiting for your little one to go and I've noticed that with this seat there are no red marks anywhere on his body from this potty, it is very soft with NO hard seems. And the price is unbelievable. 
We use this on our second child, and it does help him sleep *much* better. I wish we had had it for our first child! We own both the fleece and cotton versions, and I prefer the fleece - it does not get loose as quickly as the cotton one does. Despite the name, this is not a swaddler by itself for any but the most placid and plump babies. Our kid can easily work his arms out (usually through the slit between the arm wrap and the bottom pouch) if he is fussy. However, we still use this daily - on TOP of a swaddle done with a recieving blanket. This way, the swaddle does not come undone. Yes, you could do the same with a diaper pin, but things stay together much longer and much neater with this than with a diaper pin (or even with a second swaddle done with another recieving blanket. I haven't found a good way to use it with a car seat in which I feel comfortable - a swaddled kid has his legs together, doesn't he? - but we do sometimes use it, cocoon style, in a Baby Bjorn or sling carrier, and it can be quite magical at being soothing 
I think these are awesome! A must have for Newborns! I just had my 5th child and wish I had found these earlier! I didn't use this for long, about the first month. But it made things so much easier that I think it was worth every penny! One thing I really like is you can keep the top closed holding their arms in close while you change their diapers. They seem to not mind their diapers changed as much this way. They are also nice because they stay tightly swaddled unlike recieving blankets that loosen and move around 
The SwaddleMe was bought as a last resort to our little Houdini slipping out of every other swaddling. She was unable to wiggle her way out of this. It's a piece of cake to wrap around baby and easy to just throw in the wash. We bought 2 fleece ones for winter and a lightweight one for spring and summer. She started to get mad at being swaddled around 3 months old, so I wouldn't recommend buying one for an older baby, but our daughter was much calmer and slept better when swaddled while she was younger 
I love this product. Our baby loved to be swaddled and this product worked perfectly! Because you can velcro it closed, it didn't come undone during the night. I have purchased one for every new mom I know 
I attribute my son's great sleeping early on to the Swaddleme. The velcro is a life saver because most babies can break out of a blanket you've swaddled them in and then you worry that the blanket will smother them in the middle of the night. The only issue we had was when he got a little older and stronger, he would bust out his arm. Usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up. I'd take that any day over trying to deal with a regular blanket. It has an amazing calming effect and helps prevent them from waking themselves up with their arm and leg movements. You also should really go with the cotton because it breathes- I wouldn't recommend the fleece as that is a polyester and doesn't breathe 
I *LOVE* this product. It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro. In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles. I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out. On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme. However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot. Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty. It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling. On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free. The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures. It is trickier to find, but worth the search. The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier. The velcro is quite versatile. 
I received this as a shower gift (I'm a resurfacing new mother - my only child is now 11, so I'm starting over again...) and it was soooo easy to swaddle my newborn son. I remember struggling with my daughter to get her wrapped up in the receiving blanket and in a matter of minutes her wriggling out of the swaddle. With my son, he is cuddly in this swaddle for hours and sleeps soundly. Even my husband, who has two left thumbs can wrap him up snuggly without my help and supervision! My only thumbs down on this product is I notice that with repeated use my son can wriggle his arm out and it does it looser with age. Also, I notice it has a tendency to bunch up at the neck, so you have to be careful when you wrap the little one up in the swaddle. However, the benefits FAR outweigh those two glitches 
The organizer works wonderful, it attaches to the stroller easily and folds away for storage. We bought the organizer for a vacation so we didn't have to carry a diaper bag, it fit the essentials and a few extra items 
I bought this for my babies room to store his toys. The handles are helpful. It can be broken down for storage as well. The colors are bright and cheerful! The product is very durable as well 
I've got an active fun loving baby boy. As most babies are, he goes through several changes of clothing frequently. I use this Tote bin as his laundry bin, and it works great! i keep it next to his crib, and just throw whatever needs washing into it, clothes, bedding, toys, whatever. After it is filled, it makes a good small/medium load for washing. It is attractive looking, stands up well on its own, has 2 cutout reinforced holes for easy toting, and contains the messes well. It also doubles as a toy/mess pickup bin, great to tote toys or other items in. The size is not too deep to reach into, for adults or babies. If you fill this tote w/ small toys, baby can play w/ it for quite a while, taking things out, putting things back in and looking at the mirror on the side. Since it is a soft bin, no need to worry that baby would bump little head on it. I think this is a better size/depth than the sea life pop up organizer. I exchanged the organizer for this, and love the convenience of it(the organizer has no handle to tote around, and is too deep to get to for people w/ bad backs or small children). I also have the matching toy box, which I also love very much. they look great together in my son's nursury, both are durable, easy to clean, and safe for baby to play with 
I used this on my recent trip from Alaska to New Zealand. The pack was extremely helpful in navigating through the airport as well as boarding the plane. 
We bought this one first and it worked very well until my son outgrew it. So I decided to try the Miracle Blanket since it can be used for bigger babies.... I hated!! It is very difficult to wrap it around it and he does not sleep as well. So I decided to buy the next size up of the SwaddleMe blanket instead, peace again. I returning the other blanket, at $30 a pop not worth it. This is much cheaper and it works much bette 
My son would easily fall asleep, but had a hard time staying asleep. We tried swaddling him in blankets, but he would always escape no matter how tight we thought we had it wrapped. The velcro on the Swaddle Me blanket helped keep him buddled tightly. He would smile at me when I would get the blanket out before he went to sleep. My son was born in the early summer so the flannet blanket worked for awhile, but the cotton blanket was great for the hot nights. My baby was almost 10 pounds when he was born and 22 inches long so I ended up buying the large size eventually. The small size still got a lot of use since we used it every night. My son doesn't need to be swaddled so tightly and likes to have his hands free, now that he is 4 months old, but I will sometimes use the small size for naps. You can wrap it lower on the body to secure the baby's legs, but they can have their hands free. I have lots of friends having babies right now; the Swaddle Me blanket is always included as part of their gift. 
I purchased these for a part-time Preschool program and although they are easy to use, they are not as durable as I'd like them to be. However, we will continue to purchase them because of the price convenience 
I use this gate to contain a puppy in a kitchen area, and except for the annoying click it makes when it is (slammed) shut it was wonderfully easy to install, and is very durable. Reviews of it, however. indicated a number of users whose gate became inoperative (the latching mechanism failed) and since it is riveted in place, cannot be replaced. Manufacturer, queried on this point, tells me there are only a small number of cases where this occurred, and that the problem has been dealt with in changes in the manufacture.) I bought two mpore gates for my daughter, who is containing a very active one-year-old boy. 
I brought this for my 2nd daughter and love it, it really keeps all the sun off her, and when she is sleeping I just pull it down and its nice and dark in her stroller and the air is still flowing through, unlike when I used to put a blanket over the stroller. It fits great on my jogging stroller also, which has a tiny sunshade, now I can run without the sun blinding her. I really recomend this item 
What an amazingly great stroller. This is an umbrella stoller with all the bells and whistles. It is light enough but yet has heft. There is a detachable canopy... basket underneath... mesh baggy bottle holder... winter boot... rain cover and sun shade. There is so much. Where the child lays there is even a way to elevate the legs... you usually don't get that with the lighter strollers. If it gets too hot in the summer, you can even remove some of the fabric on the seat so that it is ventilated. I would say my favorite part is that on the canopy there is a zipper for parents to store what is necessary. First time I have seen that. Haven't really tested it yet, but it seems to roll smoothly, close down easily and open just as easily. I love the fact that I can push up the levers on the back of the stroller with my barefoot.... usually it hurts through my boots. Great buy... you won't regret it. The navy one really does look black, but the canopy seems navy. The accents that look hot pink in the picture are actually red. Good looking 
and our little boy does too. He cuddles right up against you and falls asleep at a month old, and the carrier is so comfortable.. We tried on several at Babies R Us then bought this one. you won't be dissappointed 
If you have a baby, you pretty much have to have one of these or at least something very similar. The Bjorn is the original and I think the key to their popularity is the simplicity of the design. A lot of other brands have added things (e.g. pockets, extra buckles or straps, multiple carrying positions, etc.) to try and differentiate. Bjorn has kept it simple. Both my partner and I use the same one (easily adjusts for different size people) pretty much everywhere including sweeping and mopping the floors. The boy loves facing forward where he can see everything. Hope this isn't edited: Look around for cheaper prices. They release new patterns every year and many places discount the previous years patterns 
I received this as a shower gift and I love it! I had a front carrier with my son 8 years ago, but it killed my back after 20 - 30 mins. So, I had sworn off of them, but everyone swears by this thing these days. When I was asked if I wanted one, I wasn't so sure but wanted to try it out. Now, I have been using it for the past 3 mos. and my baby girl loves it. We both have been really pleased. She goes to sleep in this thing everytime I put her in it. So, I guess it's comfortable to her too! And, I have been shopping for groceries and have gone to the mall with this on and I know I was shopping for way longer than 30 mins. No back pain!! It's fabulous! I recommend it to any parent!! 
This carrier is very easy to use without additional adult help. The straps are soft, easy to adjust and it's simple to clean (lots of slobber from my son chewing on the flap when forward facing). My lower back begins to hurt after about an hour with this on but I can't imagine any front carrier is going to feel all that good after that long. I am not rating this a 5 simply because it's expensive. I would recommend trying on a few more inexpensive brands if price is an issue 
I received this Baby Bjorn as a gift before my First Child was born in February of 2004. I used it with her up through about 9 months of age. Then when we had our second child, I pulled it out and it has been the best thing. She loves to be in it and it has saved me from having to put her down when I am chasing my first child who is now a 2 year old. I recommend any new mom to have one and it is such a great quality it lasts a long long time, it is worth the money. If we decide to have another child I will definitely be pulling it out again. Mom of 2 little girls 
Great place for my grand daughter to play, plenty of room for her to crawl she just stood up by herself for the first time because of the spaces to hold on to. It's just a little hard to assemble fold up after use. I am hoping it will move easier as it is used more 
I'm very please with this product. My son is unable to re-organize the bookshelves, dvd's, vhs's and all other things that his not suppose to touch. 
I love this for keeping my plants off limits to my 10-month old son. I live in a small apartment and have a lot of plants. I had a hard time figuring out what to do to keep them out of reach once he started moving around more. This works great! I keep the gate around my plants so my son can't get to them. An added bonus is it keeps my cat out of the plants as well. Even once we move to a house I can see using this either inside or outside to contain different areas. 
I bought this for my dog a POM. He figured out how to climb out of it within 2 weeks. I now keep chicken wire over the top of it to keep him in and it works out wonderful. He loves a kennel but I felt bad about leaving him closed up all day so I like leaving him with more room to walk without having to worry about a big mess in my house. It's very strudy 
This is a good choice. The only thing is it's not suitable for a 2 1/2 yr old kid. They can already climb out of this gate. But I still like this 
This is great. We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place. He loves to hang out in here and play. He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it, it's even safer. It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him. It gives him alot of room to play and crawl. He can stand up and hold on to the sides. He even stood by himself! The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot! We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with. This is portable and light. It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together, it's pretty sturdy. It's also indoor-outdoor, which is great for people with backyards, decks or pools. Folds up very compactly. You could easily store this in a closet when not in use. Overall, it's a great product to have and well worth the money. I highly recommend it. 
It is an excellent product, childproof, easy to install and works as intended. The locks only open when the key is placed, and as a magnet it's easy to figure out where the lock is in case you forget. You can even stick the key on fridge if you use the locks in the kitchen 
I don't know the reason for the bad reviews, this fits the P mattress very snugly, and has held up well for 3 years now; I just took them out to wash for our new baby and they're still in great shape, just a tiny bit of pilling on the fabric. No, they're not waterproof, so get a pad for underneath it. 
I ordered three different items from Liz's wish list and made the mistake of ordering the items gift wrapped from Amazon. Well, the items came today and the boxes the items are in are beautiful, but they're GREEN. I called Amazon and they're refunding my charge for the boxes (almost $14, by the way). You're better off just ordering the items and wrapping them yourself, which is what I probably will wind up doing. Anyway, hope this was helpful to all you Liz and Paul fans out there 
My friend and I purchased this item to go with the Pack 'n Play Sand Dollar for our friend's baby shower. I got this for my daughter when she was expecting my grandson almost 7 years ago. It was used daily and when my granddaughter arrived, she used it. My daughter has lent these items to friends when they travel and she has used it for visitors with small children. I know first hand the excellence of these product 
I purchased this sheet two years ago for my son's Graco Pack 'n Play. No, it isn't waterproof- but I have NEVER come across a SHEET that was. However, I recommend purchasing a BRU Especially for Baby Brand Waterproof Pad to go underneath it (Just like you would for a real mattress!). When placed over the pad, the sheet lies flat, and instantly your PNP mattress is PROTECTED! This is the only sheet I would recommend to use in a Graco Pack 'N Play because it is MADE JUST FOR THIS! Port-a-Crib sheets are different, and don't lie as flat or fit as snug- therefore, I don't feel they are as safe. This sheet is easy to launder and does not shrink- it will fit every time! I liked this sheet so much that I'd buy it again- and I DID! I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased a second one for my second PNP! 
I would have loved this baby food holder if the baby food all came in jars. Times have changed a little. Most baby food comes in square containers so, they don't fit in the holder 
I purchased two of these gates, one for the top of the stairs and another for the bottom of the stairs. It is simple for an adult to use, but tricky enough that a toddler can not open it independently. Unlike other swing gates, this gate does not have any parts that run along the floor. I have heard complaints of adults and children tripping over the "threshold" of some other gates, so I think this is a better design. Another nice feature is that this gate is made out of wood. My favorite feature is the price! I only paid about $35, while many similar gates sell for $100. I cannot give this product 5 stars, because it is a little difficult to install properly. You must be precise or the latch will not line up. Once you have it in place, it is a wonderful gate 
I installed this at the top of the stairs. Had to "rig it" to the wall(used 4 small 2X4 pieces of wood) and it is very sturdy. My son likes to shake and rattle it. Latch system is very easy to use and the directions are easy to follow for installation. 
Works well with banisters. The great thing about it is that you can remove it when you have guest over at night when the babies asleep. 
This gate is great. I have a very active 1 year old, who has tried to kick, climb, and pull this gate down but failed every time. This is NOT one of those cheap pressure mounted gates this gate is very sturdy, and mounts to the wall, you hear the lock click, so you can rest assured it's closed. It swing both ways, and opens with one hand. It also works great with our two Saint Bernards. This is a great gate. I highly recommend it. 
I purchased this for the top of a stair way. I love it. Installation was easy. Opening and closing is so easy (even my 6 year old and 11 year old have no trouble). For the cost, it is a very sturdy and excellent gate. 
I have a home day care and I own 9 of these gates. Yes, you have to mount them to the wall, but the holes are small and the safetly factor makes it worth it. The gates have stood the test of time, most are over 7 years old and are still the same, the walls have needed anchores because my dry wall has given out before the gates have. I recommend these to anyone who needs a permanent, safe, attractive gate. 
This thing is awesome! We have a 7 month old and she just loves this stroller... and so does mom! The stoller is so lightweight and easy to maneuver that you can take it almost anywhere. We live in a small city and the stroller handles uneven pavement and curbs beautifully. I have also taken the stroller off-road trail running and as long as I lock the front pivot wheel, the stoller can easily manage rocks, branches, etc. Having this stoller has given me so much flexibility and opportunity to get out of the house with my daughter... especially recreationally. Things you will love about the stoller: - VERY easy to push, turn and maneuver - Lightweight - Quick release wheels (all of them) - Great shocks - Adjustable (large) sun visor - Folds up compactly - Easy to use brake front wheel pivot release - Cool colors (we have lime green) - Reflective The only thing I could recommend as an enhanced feature would be a shoulder strap for easier carrying. This product is a great buy and defintely worth the money!!!! 
I can't say enough good things about this jogger! It has become our "everyday" stroller! My 18 month old has always been an "in arms" baby. I wear him in slings, even now at 24 pounds. But, he LOVES this ride! The swivel-wheel in front makes it super-easy to maneuver, turn, and steer. I often see parents with the older-model BOB (pre-swivel) and they have to make awkward turns by rolling their joggers onto the back wheels. What a pain! I'm SO glad I got the Revolution! Ours is the "Mesa Orange" color, but I think it reminds me of Tomato Soup, Reddish Orange, and not too bright. It reclines enough for my son to nap, and has a flap so I can look in on him. The only thing I would change is that the basket at the bottom is hard to access when my son is in the jogger. Also, if there were some sort of iPod attachment/pocket that would be a HUGE plus! (Like the Jeep stroller has) But, I purchased some folding speakers, and used velcro to seucure them (temporarily) to the canopy. Now we have tunes on our walks! I use my console (purchased seperately) to hold my cell phone, keys, iPod, and sippy cup and water bottle. Love the BOB! 
This stroller was my favortie thing we recieved for our first child! It was easy to open, easy to attach the extra metal bar for car seat adaptor. I wish all baby items were this easy! The way the stroller compacts itself makes it a little easier living on the second floor. So very light weight, but feels strudy. If you can afford it I would highly recommend this to new parents 
I used my BOB Revolution for the first time today and I loved it! Here's what i like about it: -Made of high quality, light materials -Easily maneuverable and very smooth over any surface -Sun canopy blocks out sun from any angle without obstructing the passenger's view -Large viewing window on top of canopy -Storage basket is large and easily accessible -Seat reclines -Straps are easy to adjust -Front wheel is easy to lock and unlock (the pivoting front wheel is a MUST on a jogger) -Easy to fold and transport -Brake is easy to engage and disengage This stroller is worth the money 
My wife and I love our Revolution. It is so easy to lock or unlock the front wheel for stability or manuverability. It is light and tough, and folds up fairly compactly with ease. I haven't tried many other joggers, but couldn't be happier with the BOB 
Latches work great, but they are a little difficult to install on existing cabinets. Would be easy if the cabinet was being assembled at the time of installation 
I recieved this item very quickly. My daughter will love to swing in this 
We've had this swing for three summers (we take it down in the winter)and it still works great. The tray is nice to keep the older kids off this swing and theres a three point safety strap we use once the girls got old enough to try to stand or climb out. The seat reclines a little for when the girls were real young. Holes in the bottom of the swing means no standing water after it rains. We love it 
my baby is 8 months old and loves this swing. I love it too! It's much easier than other brands to fasten and unfasten the baby in the swing. I love how the tray moves out of the way to get the baby in and out easily. It came with the hooks too so all we had to do was hook it up to our existing swing set. 
This swing is perfectly safe... Setting it up was a piece of cake and our 6 month old Loves to swing in it 
I first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1. He LOVED it, it was his best birthday gift. Since then, it has become our standard one-year-old gift. I've given it to dozens of children and received rave reviews every time. When a friend bought this for my son's first birthday, we were thrilled. He and his friends are now nearly four and still like to swing in it even though they have mastered the big-boy swing. My one-year-old will sit in it watching the big kids play in the garden and he is a mover - does not like to sit still at all. It is also perfect on days when the ground is too wet to crawl around (which seems like everyday lately). By the way, I read the 'upside down' post. I was concerned and tried to turn mine upside down without a child in it and the ropes are balanced that I could not turn it even empty. That family may have had defective ropes or it was installed improperly.. 
My one year old loves this swing!! It is hung from hooks on our back porch and he swings for hours!! The great part is the tray for cheerios, toys etc 
This steamer works great, and holds more accessories than the Avent sterilizer. It is very easy to use. Plus, it's about twenty bucks less than the Avent. More money to use on diapers 
I had the boy version of this product with my baby and I loved it so much I bought this one for my sister-in-law! Great product...cheap price 
This is a very soft and sturdy bouncer, the fabric is soft and the headrest is very nice. I would recommend this to anyone having a little girl!!!! 
Fisher price (FP) designs many bouncers, but this style is the best due to the leg design. Some of the FP bouncers have very stiff legs so they do not bounce easily. The legs curve/bow out from the seat (check out image of product). Because of this leg design you can easily place your foot and bounce the baby. My baby will fall asleep with me bouncing and then I turn on the vibration and leave her be. I wasn't crazy about the PINK design, but I know the leg design is offered with a Bunny print as well, but that appears to be discontinued. The key thing is to find the FP bouncer that has the legs that curve/bow out from the seat base 
I bought this stroller, because I really hate using them, the packing/unpacking storage there of and such.(I prefer to carry my son in a Baby Bjorn, and a backpack when he gets bigger.) This stroller is light and folds down nicely. Even fits the trunk of my G35 Coupe, which barely classifies as a trunk. I use it for my son's Peg Perego carseat. It is not something you would take on the trail or jog with and doesn't have alot of storage; but for going for walks, using at the mall and such applications it does work well. HT 
I have never written a review before, but after 4 months of using the Flash EX stroller I have to encourage more users! I have tried others' car seat strollers and they are not nearly as light and easy as this one. I love that it folds in thirds, because you can travel with it in your car AND it fits into the overhead compartment on an airplane, which means that it won't suffer the insults from baggage handling. I use it with the Safe Seat, which fits wonderfully without any adjustments (just use the seatbelt!). The only downside is that the underside basket is small, but I think the small portability and ease of use (including the carrier strap) makes it very worthwhile. My favorite baby purchase so far 
After looking at all of the options, we decided on this car seat carrier. It is perfect! First, it is the lightest and least bulky of all of the carriers. It folds up into nothing and makes for a very maneuverable stroller. Second, it has great suspension that is more forgiving over rough surfaces. Third, it is by far the most sleek and stylish car seat carrier available. I'm not one to write reviews of products, but I felt compelled to write something since we have used this carrier every day for the last 3 mos, and it is one of the most useful things we own. You won't be disappointed 
I loved the fact that this folded in half so that it gives you more space in your trunk for groceries. It is soooo narrow that it can fit in between any ailes in stores. It is really easy to open and close. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to lift the infant seat up every time I wanted to get to my diaper bag underneath. The basket is soooo small and very hard to get to when the infant carrier is in place so I would put my cell phone, keys, and wallet in the three pockets on the handle and that solved the problem 
I'm writing this review to tell other potential buyers that this "universal" car seat carrier does not technically fit a Baby Trend Snug Ride infant car seat (another great product). The description listed on this web site states that it does. Instead of returning it, my crafty husband made a few of his own alterations to keep our baby girl safe. Ultimately, I was looking for a universal car seat carrier that was black and/or gray instead of navy blue, and this is what I found. Despite feeling misled, I'm rating this carrier four stars because it serves its purpose very well, especially for those who have an infant seat that is actually compatible. My only other complaint is that the basket is difficult to access 
I love this stroller! Its lightweight and durable. My son also enjoys this stroller (I think it is because he can see mommy!) I would highly recommend this stroller! : 
I bought this carrier shortly before I flew with my baby for the first time. We have a Peg car seat, and I didn't want to schlepp my Peg stroller through the airport, etc. while on vacation. To my surprise, I find that I use my Combi Flash much more often than my Peg stroller. It's very lightweight, is very easy to pop open, and has held up well through various trips. I also like that it has a handlebar that goes all the way across, because it is much easier to steer (especially one-handed). My husband also had a tricky time removing the plastic parts that you have to pull off in order to make this work with the Peg; once they were off, though, the stroller has been a breeze. I would give one word of warning: you do have to be careful with this stroller that it is (1) popped all the way open (there's an audible clicking noise when this happens) and (2) that the car seat carrier is strapped in. The Peg carseat sort of just rests on top of the carrier, which makes it a bit susceptible to tipping over on uneven surfaces. 
These are easy to use, convenient, and make clean-ups a breeze. As for the reviewer who complained that these don't stick to tablecloths -- uh, you're worried about germs and cleanliness in restaurants with tablecloths? I've found that these adhere quite well to a variety of surfaces, and my son enjoys the designs. People frequently stop by our table to ask where we found these Table Toppers, then exclaim, "If only they'd had those when we had a baby!" You've gotta love that 
I love table toppers. We currently live in Asia and travel all over the world. We've used them in Japan, China and in the USA. Food gets spilled off plates, dumped on tables and plopped in little kids mouths. With table toppers we KNOW that the surface they are eating off isn't filled with germs. My daughters like to rip them off the table occasionally, but we found that the trick is to fasten the edge close to them over the edge of the table and wait to put them down until right before the food arrives, that way they are more focused on the food than the placemat 
I have tried 3 other mattress pads, and none of them held up more than a couple washings from shrinking and ripping. This Pad actually fits the mattress! Finally! Well worth the money. Not waterproof, but since the crib mattress is, I didn't need a waterproof mattress pad. A great quality, worry free product that delivers as promised! 
If you have a fussy baby or just bottle feed, Dr. Brown's are the best. We have twin girls and first 3 months they were gased up and it was not fun. Someone recommended Dr. Brown's bottles, which we were willing to try anything, and they were the best thing we have ever used. If you have a fussy baby then you will know what I am talking about. If you are giving a gift for a baby shower, this is the best gift you could give. I can't say enough good things are Dr. Brown's. I was upset our doctor did not tell us about these bottles, instead she had us giving them drops and buying the most expensive formula on the market. Nothing worked until these bottles 
I use this on top of my son's dresser that is short and viola! it's a changing table. I've never had any problems with it and we've been using it for almost two years now. I highly reccomend it for the way I use it (without an actual changing table) or with one I'm sure it works too. 
I got this changing pad for my dresser/changing table. I wasn't really sure if it would fit well, but it's perfect. I love how the sides go up pretty high. I don't worry about my daughter rolling off the table. It comes with a washable terry cloth cover that I don't think the description mentions. I really like this changing pad 
This is very cute. It could be a tad bigger, but it's perfect for not having to find the pacifiers in the bottom of a diaper bag or purse. And it looks nice on the outside of my diaper bag! I can fit 2-3 pacifiers in mine 
I have owned this warmer for approximately 4 months. It does an great job of keeping the wipes warm and the light comes in handy at night. I only had a couple incidents where the wipes dried out. This was due to me leaving the top open or not latching the sides. Other than that, I have had no issues... I don't even add water and the wipes still retain moisture 
I love this wipe warmer. My daughter loves the warm wipes. The warmer heats the wipes to about the same temp as her bath water. My wipes are staying moist. I am filling the warmer half full on the advise from a friend, so they don't dry out. So far no problems. I am getting another one for our downstairs changing area. The nightlight is nice because you can see how many wipes are left 
I have been using this pump since my daughter was born 7 weeks ago. It is very easy and comfortable to use, and works very quickly. I highly reccomend this pump to anyone who plans to pump on a regular basis 
I chose this pump after researching and reading reviews. It works perfectly! I haven't tried double pumping yet, but on a single pump, I usually get 3 to 4 oz. in about 10 minutes. I haven't had any trouble with discomfort when using it and I love the fact that I can pump directly into the Playtex dropins. 
I've waited a while to add my 2 cents about this pump, and I can honestly say that it is a keeper. It is very comfortable and efficient. I still pump 2x a day and my daughter is now 11 months. Love the embrace 
The Embrace is extremely comfortable. My wife loved it when compared to a friend's Medela. One complaint though....it does pump a little slower then other pumps.....but the extra comfort is well worth it! Playtex has awesome customer support. My wife accidently tore one of her valves (little white points that fit under each cup). She called playtex and they immediately FED EXed her 4 replcement valves for free. They only asked that we return the torn valve(s) for R Be careful with the valves they are a bit fragile and if you tear one it adversely affects the suction of that cup. 
Am very happy I purchased this product, Am able to stay away for hours while baby is with my Mom. It is a must have for every breastfeeding Mom. It's fast and very effective. It's discreet too, comes in a great tote bag and the little bottle bag is well insulated. I strongly recommend it. 
I was able to breastfeed my son until he was eleven months old, while working full time by using this pump. I used it with the One-Step Storage system, which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work. The cups were super-comfortable, and after some practice, I had no trouble getting letdown. I could usually pump 4-6 oz per 15-20 minute session. I haven't noticed that it is any noiser than my friend's Medela. I haven't tried other electric pump, however, I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it. This one was perfect for me 
This is a great pump! At first I was looking at pumps that cost around the $70 range. I am so glad that I decided to spend the extra money! My daughter was not too keen on breastfeeding and it just turned into a horrible experience that I'd like to forget. The hospital that I was in provided the Medela pump. Ouch!!! My breasts were sooo sore from using that thing, it was not comfortable at all! The cups for the breast is this hard plastic and when it would pump, my poor nipples were getting so sore and then i had to use nipple cream to make them feel better. I actually could not have anything on my breasts while i was at the hospital because they were so sore. It made me so grouchy and I just let everything hang out. I didn't care who came in the room!!! When I came home and started using the Playtex pump, it was such a relief! The cups for the breasts have a soft rubbery feel to them and they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping. The 5 speed/suction controls are very nice to have. It does come with a storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy's. I had to buy 2 extra storage kits so that I had enough contraptions to use for storing milk. I really hope that makes sense! And then there's the liners. I had liners coming out of my ears! I guess that's how Playtex makes their money, you have to buy tons of liners (and don't forget the storage kits). The pump is a little loud when the suction is set higher. I used it for 4 months and everything worked great. I definitely recommend this pump. I would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is spending the extra money on storage kits and the countless number of liners you have to buy. BUT... It is a world of difference between Medela and Playtex. 
I love this pump. I've tried Medela and hospital grade pumps and this is by far the most comfortable pump ever. I'm the proud mom of almost 5 month old twin girls and I used hospital pump which got me bleeding on second day. Problem, flangies were too small for me and they didn't have anything larger. Embrace is the right size for me and after getting home from the hospital on the 3rd day I have been married to my pump 24/7. We had latching problems so I was never able to fully nurse my babies, but with Embrace I'm still going strong after 5 months and pump 50-60oz/day. I have had NO problems with my pump, no motor failures, no tube problems, nothing. I've pumpped with it like I said, almost 5 months on average 5 times a day. It may be a bit noisy... my husband calls it a respirator :) But I would not switch my pump to Medela or any other for anything. I'm sorry some of you have had bad experience with your Embrace, not everybody's body is made the same and not every manufacturing lot is the same, I'm sure of that. This pump has been a life saver for me and my girls and I have no plans on stopping pumping. I started with the 4oz bottles that came with the system and eventually graduated pumping into Dr.Brown's 8oz bottles. I love the fact that I can pump directly to both narrow and widemouth bottles. I've never cleaned my pump nor bottles in the dishwasher, but wash them by hand. I started working when my girls were 9 weeks old, so I guess I can be called a WAHM (I'm a web developer and work from home) and I didn't notice any drop in supply during the work day compared to the weekend. WORTH EVERY CENT! Try, compare... Not every Medela user is happy with their pump either. There is no product out there that is going to satisfy everybody. Embrace just is better 
I received this pump as a gift I'm was very pleased with the outcome. I considered a couple of others, but this one impressed me for a first time mom I couldn't have choose another. Breastfeeding was new for me and I knew I wanted something that was comfortable efficient as well. I started out with the Medela while in the hosptial and it was horrible. It pulled my nipples and made them very sore and that was on the lowest suction. I'm glad I received this one as a gift and after 4 months of use it's still going strong. I'm able to use it at work and that's a plus because everything is so handy. Hope you consider this one because you won't be disappointed. 
I really like this mobile. It keeps my 13 week old infant entertained and she also falls asleep to it from time to time. She gets so mesmorized by it that she will fall asleep. My only problem with it was the first one they sent me did not work but Amazon does such a great job with returning it that all I had to do was email them that it do not work and they sent me one right away to replace it and all I had to do was print the label out and postage and everything was taken care of, just had to drop it off at the post office. I actually got the replacement within 4 days so that is pretty good. They are on top of things. 
My baby loved it since he's 3-month old. He liked to stare at those 3 animals for minutes and smiled at them. Now he's over one year, he still loves it. He can point to each animal and talk to them. This is one thing that can make he calm down and let me change his diaper easily 
My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and loves this mobile! She will watch it go around for 30 minutes. While it is on she smiles, kicks her legs, coos at it. No other toy or mobile has kept her attention like this has. I see why this particular mobile has won so many awards 
LOVE the shade - fits well on my double Kolcraft - does a good job protecting babies from the sun, can be pulled right down for when they are napping. Folds and stores well 
I love this shade. It doesn't stand up to the wind, but if you pull it far enough down towards the bar of the stroller it usually stays put. I have my toddler hold it on those windy days if we're having a problem with it blowing back at me. The shade serves its purpose, it keeps the harmful rays away from my beautiful little ones 
Good shade for the little angels. Would recommend this for every mother that wants to sheild her babies and toddlers from the harsh sun rays. The shade is big, flexible and easy to attach to any stroller. I use a macalaren. The coverage is wonderful!!! You fix it the way you want...all the way to cover up to the babies feet or half way . The sides are well protected too!! May not be so good on real windy days but still does the job when not fighting with the winds 
I have a graco side by side stroller. Like with most strollers, the canope on this stroller is almost useless. Why is it so hard for the companies to figure out what we Mom's really want? A functionable canope would be one thing for example. On most strollers they are a joke. So I bought this sunshade. Positive: folds up flat and easily;attaches easily (though you may have to fiddle a bit to find the best position);side pockets are a nice extra and help to weigh the shade down some as well ( and you can perhaps hide some goodies in there because they are really not easy to spot );it shelters from the side as well; Negative: Hello.. a slight wind and this thing bends backwards or moves sideways; When the sun comes from the front, while setting, you can't really pull it down far enough to protect your children. Living on an island we deal with wind all the time and so it is not as practical as I would like this shade to be. But still would recommend it over leaving the child just exposed. Perhaps if you have less wind to deal with you really will like this shade. I gave it a 4 star because it does protect my children and that is what matters. You deal with the negative points,but I wished it would have been designed for all weather. I don't see how you can attach a weight and still allow it to stand up correctly. The material is too thin for that. But I am open for ideas and suggestions. I don't have problems folding the stroller together while shade is attached. Perhaps that is just a matter of trying and see what you prefer and like. All in all it is worth the money and afford because your little ones deserver and need the proctection. Till the strollers are made with better canopes, we will have to rely on something like this. I also have the Peg Perego Aria stroller and had bought the single one for that one. Same issue, problems with wind but otherwise a nice protection. And yes you will have to fold it back when you put baby in. Perhaps that was the main concern of the designer. Easy acess to the baby.  
they are so easy to install and work so much better than the ones you just stick in the plug and are easier too! 
This bottle sterilizer is a great time saver. Zap it in the microwave for five minutes and bottles are done. I do not recommend that you use it if you have a large amount of bottles to clean, it's easier to boil them! It's great for sterilizing pacifier's too!! 
This jogger is great - I love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints, in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mo 
This a wonderful stroller. I have a large 35lb, 2yr old and he is very comfortable. Great folding mechanism. Folding is easy and I can do it with one hand. Nice pockets for storage 
This product is worth the price. when I recieved it it put a smile on my face. it is adorable the little turtle is just so cute!!! 
This pop-up bin will hold anything including soiled laundry, far too many stuffed animals, up to 2 toddlers (though not recommended, I'm sure) and the entire contents of the family coin jar! It's pretty durable and versatile. Ours has survived all sorts of trials put upon by my almost 3 year old and it still looks new 
I bought this at Toys "R" us as a place to store stuffed animals. I actually keep my infant son's toys in it, and my two year old likes to unzip it and get toys out for his little brother. It's perfect 
I love this product. When it arrived I saw that it was as adorable as I expected it to be. I plan to use it as a hamper in my baby's room. I like that it zips shut and that it is light-weight so I can carry the whole thing into the laundry room. The sea animals on it are so cute, I smile every time I look at it. It is also the perfect size for my needs 
This table is great for toddlers, and it's so light and easy to move around/store for the adults. We use it inside for snack-time, but it is easy to move outside for a picnic. Highly recommend it 
Other tables were double to triple the price. Look no further than this table, as it is just perfect for toddlers and is sturdy and safe. We have several of these in our church nursery as well and have four 1-2 year olds sit at each one without any trouble. To have this table be portable is just a fantastic bonus 
We purchased this table when our daughter was 18 months old. It is the best table out there, it is very sturdy and she learned to get in and out of it very easily which was a plus over tables with separate chairs. Our daughter is now 2+ yrs old and we still use it every day. We use it to draw and paint, take it outside to our garden and bring it back in, nothing seems to damage it, my husband and I even sit on it sideways. I love the fact that it folds nicely for storage. This table has been a hit with our daughter's little friends too, when they come over several kids will sit together and eat and I've even taken it to the park for picnics. BEST BUY!!! We expect to be using it for at least another 2 years or more. Even our 5 year old nephews want to eat breakfast in it whenever they stay over! 
The table is the greatest thing we have purchased yet! Our 24 month old daughter loves the table for eating and for arts and crafts. When she colors on it, we wipe it off, when she needs to eat, she carries her plate to the table and prefers to sit there vs. the big table. It was a great investment for us 
This past November I purchased a Bundle Me Pink. Starting in October I would put a blanket over my child in the car seat to keep her warm as we live in the Midwest climate. When there was a little bit of wind it seemed hard to keep it in place. I then decided to buy a Bundle Me Pink. No need to put heavy clothes on or a big coat or even a snow suit! This is one of the BEST purchases I have made for our child. It is so easy to install in your baby's car seat too. I plan to buy the light weight version and the toddler one when our child gets of age. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a baby who lives in the cooler climates. 
The product is eactly what was needed and ordering it from Amazon was both easy and quick. It was received in perfect condition in a very timely manner. The perfect item for a new born in Vermont 
I bought the Bundle Me for my new granddaughter born in November, and my daughter and her family live in the Minneapolis area. It is easy for them to put the baby in the carrier, zip up the Bundle Me and there is no way the baby gets any cold air on her. The Bundle Me zips up on both sides and the top covers the baby's head or folds down for her to see. It is hard to put a coat, mittens, hat, etc. on a newborn or young infant, and it is just not necessary with this really cool product. Unlatch the car seat and carry it in and the baby stays warm. I bought the heavier version due to the climate and time of year but I bet the lighter version is equally great 
This is a great product for fall or winter babies if you live in a cold climate. It does away with bulky snowsuits which are inconvenient as well as unsafe. This is easy to use with any infant car seat. It allows baby to stay warm when needed and unzips easily when he/she does not without disturbing him/her. A must have for any cold weather baby!! 
after i brought my baby home from the hospital, i put her in the bundle me and she Loved it! you could see how secure she felt when she was in it! 
I bought this for my daughter when she was born in October. We used it all winter long. It is very convenient and easy to put on the stroller or infant carrier. It has holes to fit the staps through, so the baby is strapped in and secure. We didn't have to bother with jackets and snowuits, just put the baby in and zip it up 
I have tried Huggies, Luvs, White Cloud, and Seventh Generation, and the Pampers Baby Dry worked best at preventing leaks for my baby boy. For overnight, I do recommend Huggies Overnites Size 4--now he sleeps through the night 
The footstool was just what I wanted. It was in great condition and arrived just 2 days after I order it 
I bought two of these steps (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) for my daughter when she was 2 and started potty training. She's 3 now and still uses them everyday to independantly wash her hands, brush her teeth and reach higher shelves on her bookshelf. They are in great shape and perfect working order still! This is one of the best steps because it is higher than many steps out there, but the 2-step design makes it easier for smaller children to use 
This step still is great for my 2 year old. It's very durable, made of pine, I think, and goes with everything in the bathroom. I do like the fact that I can paint it any color I wanted later, since it's just made out of wood. I bought it b/c it was the only step stool I found where the second step folded inside the bigger step, for when she gets older. The second step is so easy to pull in and out, that my toddler can do it now too. I gave it four stars becasue it would have been nice if it could have converted into a chair too. 
Like the other reviewer, I purchased two of these pads for use with my 23 year old disabled child. My daughter wears a Depends and we supplement with disposable pads (which are very thin), and I am thrilled with the quality of the Soaker product. They wash well (cool water, cool tumble dry)and are well worth the money. The appear to be very well made - hopefully they will last a long while, but at this price it won't be a hardship to replace them. I highly recommend this product 
This item is great if you have someone who is incontinent and want to protect the mattress. It is not limited to babies. I am using for my 26 year old disabled son and it will absorb one soaking by an adult before it is saturated. We use it as a backup to his attends and it has protected the matress. We now have a grandbaby coming and will be buying more for the crib. I would recommend this to anyone who needs this type of coverage, easy to wash, easy to use and it does the job of protecting the mattress 
This is a perfect little hat to match the Original Bundle Me Covers. My daughter loved her hat and it kept her little head nice and warm. Plus, it's so cute. 
This hat is gorgeous. Very thick, with an inner lining. Its the perfect match to accompany the Bundleme 
The door jams are great. Easy to install, all one piece so I do not have to worry about my daughter crawling around them. She figured out how to take the white caps off the standard door stops in a few minutes 
You will be getting lots of sale, when my daughter open my gifts they all wanted to know where I purchase the toys, meal and play mat etc! Thanks again for a great job! R. Q. 
this mat really helps with clean ups after meals, just run a spounge over to clean and its done 
for several reasons. It is mulitpurpose and as you know if you are a parent that is a big plus. Right now I use it to catch my son's flying food but it can later be used to protect the table top from art projects. Wonderful addition to any shower gift 
We used this as a play mat before our baby was eating solids. He liked looking at the colorful images and it kept his drool off of the carpet. We moved it under his highchair when he started eating and it helps keep baby from staining the carpet. I wish it was bigger though, so it would protect a larger area. And I wish it was thicker. Since our dining room is carpeted, the wheels of the highchair push the mat into the carpet and stretch it a bit. This leaves crescent-shaped bumps or indentations on the mat. Overall it is a good product, especially for the price 
I bought this mat for my six-month-old baby. And he is so excited by the colorful display on the mat. You can tell by his expressions, that he just loves the colors. I am not sure, if the he understands the characters yet but the colors dazzle him. I guess it is a good stimulus for his brains. Also, this mat is very inexpensive, has a good quality and a very decent size. I highly recommend this product 
I love this item. I agree the colors are loud but my babies seem to love seeing their little friends at meal time. I fixed the loud colors problem and put the Sesame Street mat in their playroom and am using the softer winnie the Pooh version. I love that its easy to clean, teaches them colors and numbers. The only thing is like the others above I wish it was bigge 
Small, organized, cheap, just enough for the top of the dresser and keeps everyhing contained. Can't ask for more 
The depot fits nicely next to the changing pad and does hold the essentials. I just wish the two side containers were a little bigger; they do not fit the big bottles of lotion with much room for anything else. Overall, I would recommend this product, especially for the price. 
The dresser top Diaper Depot is a great thing to have in the nursery. The Prince Lionheart wipe warmer sits perfectly on top of it. I did not need the space to store diapers, but use that area for Q-tips, lotion, thermometer, etc. It has really organized the changing area for us. I highly recommend it! 
If you are operating with limited space and like for things to be organized then you will find this product very helpful.  I have my unit holding quite a few newborn diapers, the Lionheart wipes warmer, and many little accessories in each side holder. All of this sits neatly on top of my baby's dresser. All in order and ready for me to use when needed. 
I love this product. It's great to store all your diapering needs in one place. I got this as a gift and simply love it. It holds a good amount of items and it matches with every nursery theme. A must have for any mom! 
I bought a blue one for my baby so I could see to change her diapers in the middle of the night without turning on bright lights. I keep it on my nightstand and carry the budy to her crib. It's safe to set it down in the crib next to her. It comes on automatically when you pick it up from its base and shuts off again when you set it back down on the base. The base is magnetic, so don't keep it close to any electonics like TVs or computers. I love it so much that I bought an orange one for my stepson's room. The orange one glows red when the light is on. Then I bought three more as gifts for various friends and family with young children. And today, I went ahead and bought the green one for myself. They stay lit for 10 hours so it's great for all the power outages we get here in the winter. I also use it to get ready for bed or to find things in my room at night while my husband is sleeping since he gets up to go to work much earlier than me. It's bright enough to help me find my way around in the dark but not bright enough to wake him or the baby. It's also great as a guest night light. And it has a very soft glow that doesn't hurt your eyes when you need to get up in the middle of the night. 
Just got this for my 3yr old daughter and she loves him! The blue light is soft, but bright enough to get you around a dark room or hallway. Perfect night time companion for kids 
My only complaint is that the remote is loud, so we never use it. The music is great, although, some of the music is programmed under the wrong composer. Oh well. I guess the babies aren't reading the composers' names anyway 
As a new mom I was looking for something that would hold my daughter's interest.My 1 month old daughter loves this mobile. We put it on her crib she slept there the entire night without a fuss. The night light is just right to soothe the sound level is perfect. During the day, I get my work done with her totally occupied with the bright colours "jungle" sounds. Easy to assemble great price...couldn't ask for better. My only problem with it, are the batteries..it eats them up, solved that problem by using recharables. All in all, one fantastic mobile. 
I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece. They love it too!! This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part. Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes. My 13 month old loves it (and so does my 4 year old). He is just mesmerized by it when he's tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he's done sleeping. I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet. I wanted to set the record straight. The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be? I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it's just fine. I highly recommend this mobile 
My little girl has had this mobile in her crib since she was a couple weeks old and she has always loved it. She used to just watch the animals move around and fall asleep to the soothing music. Now she will turn her head to watch the base when it lights up. This was a great buy for us. My only complaint would be the little remote that comes with it. The clicker is very loud... which, if you are using the remote, it's because you are trying to turn the mobile on without being seen and the loud click gets my girl's attention every time. We just don't use the clicker anymore but the fact remains that she loves the mobile itself. She'll be bummed when we have to take it down 
Check to see if the crib or play-yard you intend this for will actually work with it. When mine didn't, I decided to attach it (secure and safe) to my headboard. Curious about reports that it's not loud enough, I laid down and had a listen. It's plenty loud enough, even at a distance of 2.5 feet overhead. Remember, your infant hasn't spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert! When the baby (9 weeks old) finally got a shot at it, he was enchanted, stimulated, very excited. So much for soothing -- but it's wonderful to know that while I'm having to fold laundry he's watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music. A great addition to the day with baby.. 
I compared reviews on this mobile along with the TinyLove mobile called Symphony in Motion and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile. I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is. And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well. Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too. In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed. She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round. But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime. My husband and I are VERY pleased with this purchase 
This mobile sends him off to sleep every time. I love that the music lasts so long--with the wind up ones, he would just start to settle down when it would shut off. There are two volume levels; usually the quieter one is enough for bedtime. My only (minor) complaint is that the remote control for it makes a loud clicking sound when you press it (enough to make him stir, but not wake up). 
We bought this for my 3 month old son and he loves it. There are many nights that he has fallen asleep by watching the peek a boo leaves open and close. I think the level of volume is perfect. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little hesitant to order it, but remember- It is not supposed to stimulate your baby! It is to lul them to sleep! I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs. I would recommend this product-like I said I love it 
My little one is still on the way, but I can already tell that this product will receive a lot of use. It's larger than the other pack and plays out there and much more colorful. The way I see it, a pack and play is place for the baby to explore safely and the combination of the vibrant colors, cute bug toys and mirror on the 4 sides, and padded mat on the bottom make this an ideal location for baby to safely learn about the world. It doesn't come with the bassinet and changer that smaller models do, but those only work while baby is little anyway. This product will be used for years 
Good size. Easy setup. Colorful design. No frills 
just right. keeps the little one happy safe in one place. My daughter especially loves the toys built into the sides. The only minus is that it is a bit heavy to move around 
We left our hand-me-down pack and play at our parents house. We were going away before we could get it back from them so we quickly ordered a this one. Having watched our first child barely fit in our first one (which was a rectangle) as she grew, we were happy to see how spacious this square version was. It looks like an old fashion play pen. Our second child has PLENTY of room to grow and even at 8 months was taken by all the stuff on the sides. That said, space comes with a price- it weighs about 22lbs. So, we did have to wrestle it through the airport and onto the plane for our trip. But, in the end, would I buy it again? Yes, the space is worth it 
EXCELENT!!! It arrived exactly when they told me it would, it is big and my baby loves it!!!! Safe and very colorful!! 
If we would have known this was available earlier, we wouldn't have bought the smaller play-yard that we replaced this with. Our son, who is 21 months and is in the 90 percentile for height and weight,just loves this play-yard and we love the fact that he is safer and more comfortable than ever before. We are very pleased with the quality, the size, the portability, and the color scheme. This is by far the best money we have spent for a child related item. We highly recommend this item and we are confident that you will be pleased with it just as we are. 
I got this play pen for a 1 1/2 year old wondering if he could tip it over. He couldn't because it is square in design - yeah. He did try to pile things up to climb over but the side was just a little too high. It's comfortable and colorful. I love it 
i run an in home daycare.....i have several of the traditional pac n play playpens ..however they do not allow the room to "play" as these do....... great for confining a toddler but still allowing them room for freedom to move around and have toys .. they are confined but don't feel "trapped".. very easy to set up and take down !!! .. this is one of the best investments !!! .. A+ in my book 
We live on a small military base overseas. My first stroller got all moldy in storage, so we purchased this one when the new baby came. My 3 year old loves the stroller, he calls it his spaceship, or his horse depending on the day and his mood. He hasn't sat in a stroller since he learned how to walk, but he will ride on this all day long. My newborn loves the stroller as much as any newborn loves something. It handels very well, even on uneven cobblestone walkways. Everyone on base comments on how cool the stroller is, several friends with babies on the way are considering purchasing one of their own. We love it and are sort of glad our old one got moldy, so we could get the new one. :- 
I got this stroller last week... I agree with the other reviewers to skip the joovy... I only got that one because I thought the more expensive the stroller the better. Was I wrong... the Joovy way too heavy and hard to push - no tray to carry anything, not as big of a basket on the bottom. The sit n stands front seat is way bigger. My 4.5 year old has more room in back to sit stand. I have a 4.5 year old that is by no means short neither she is 44 inches and weighs 42 lbs and a 7 month old that weighs 15 lbs. I love the infant car seat holder. This works our really well... I didn't know they had this option when I bought it so it was a bonus for me since I thought I was going to have to take my 7 month old daughter out of her carseat to put in this stoller, but I just put my infant carseat in there. This stoller is compatable with almost all infant car seats - we have Graco. It it by no means at all hard to push... my 4.5 year old loves to sit in the back of the baby... definately worth the $120... I wish I would have gotten this one before the joovy. I have taken this stoller to the airport and shopping so far and it has made my life easier with a 4.5 year old and an infant. I am 5'7 and the handle to push is perfect for my height - usually a problem I have with other strollers the handles being lower. 
Prior to buying this stroller I had the Joovy. It was heavy, awkward to fold, and had a very small basket underneath, and no parent tray. Even worse, the child tray did not move. This meant I had to squeeze my child in between the seat and the stroller, and adjusting her body and legs was very difficult. She was very uncomfortable and cried any time I put her in it. I bought this stroller and we all LOVE it. Here is why: 1. Easy opening child tray so child goes in and out of stroller easily 2. Large undercarriage basket 3. Parent tray, with 2 cup holders and a closed compartment, big enough for a few keys, money etc. 4. Good head/body room for the standing child 5. Weighs about the same as a one child stroller 6. Opens and folds with one hand Skip the Joovy, go for this one, you will be glad you did 
This stroller would be great if your kids doesn't fall asleep while riding it. The Sit-n-Stand stroller doesn't recline. If you have kids who might fall asleep while you shop or just take a wall around the park or block it can be very uncomfortable for the child. This stroller is good for quick task. It is just meant for Sit and Stand as the name it is given. Also, to fold this stroller there is a trick to the front wheels. It is not very hard to steer this stroller; it fits fine in my Honda civic trunk while I still have plenty of room for a diaper bag as well as a few filled shopping bags. All in all an "okay" stroller 
I received these from a friend in Detroit, MI when my son was only a baby. He is now 16 months old and these table toppers have become indespensible. McDonalds, the fish camp, Back Yard Burgers, even the finest restaurants. They stick very well and even if he pulls on them, they are stuck. The good thing is that they do not pull off the finish! He loves the ones with Blues Clues and we go over the characters and fruits that are printed on them while we are waiting for our food. Keep a couple in a snack size zippy bag and put them in the diaper bag. The full bag is just too big. Do yourself and your little one a favor and get a bunch of these. Makes this mommy feel much better about not getting germy 
My wife and I have 3 children ages 3 and under so we've got baby monitors all over the house. We've used I think in total 5 differet models from 4 different manufacturers including Fisher-Price, Graco, Summer, and Sony. We've used both audio/video and audio only. This Fisher-Price model is by far the best we've used. - Range. We have approximately 1500 sqft on the floor where we sleep. Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the floor as the youngest baby's room. Other receives either didn't pickup at all or when they did they were full of static and background noise so much so that there was a continual hissing of static that we had to constantly endure. This receiver can be set at a very low volume so that background noises are almost silent but the baby can still be easily heard. - Rechargable. With the other monitor receivers it was a hassle to move from room to room. You have to unplug the receiver and find somewhere else to plug it in. One of the other models did offer a battery backup but we didn't use it for fear of going through batteries all the time. This receiver has a built in rechargable battery. Unplug it and take it with you. When you're done plug it back in and it charges and is ready for the next use. We're very pleased not only with the quality but also with the price. Amazon's price was nearly $30 less than Babies R Us 
This product is better then most. Now I am sure if you want to pay over$100.00 for a monitor it MAY be better but for the price and what I need it for it works GREAT!!!! I love the choice of channels and that if the baby is sleeping I do not have to hear static and hope I can hear if he is chocking. If the baby moves this monitor picks it up. Also the light indication is a plus. Great monitor! I would recommend this product 
I was going to keep the receiver in our office which has a lot of computer equipment. We bought a 900 MHz monitor because most of our equipment runs on 2.4 GHz. We were hoping there would be less interference. We were surprised and very pleased with how well this monitor worked. The receiver produces a faint hum, but overall, the reception is clear. Every now and then, I hear a clicking sound over the receiver, but I'm not sure if it's the monitor or the hot air humidifier I keep in the baby's room. We are definitely pleased with this purchase 
I love this monitor! No static, does not interfere with my cordless phones...its great! I keep the radio on in my twins room and I can STILL hear them if they cry. Worth the purchase 
I love the lights- so nice when you don't want to hear rustling from simple baby movements. Just turn down the volume and place in front of you when putting your feet up 
This is great for keeping your little one from slamming a door shut and possibly shutting himself in somewhere or pinching his fingers in the door jamb. It's best for doors that are meant to stay open though, and might slip off doors that are thinner. It's great for the price and does the job 
This was the one toy I brought from amazon that did not have a problem. My son loves it and the price was right 
This is a lot better quality than I thought it would be. It is really thick and quite large. I'm buying another one right now for my other car seat to replace the protector that came with the car seat 
Great product - keeps the seats of your vehicle clean when the little ones are munchin' on snacks. A lifesaver 
A friend lent me hers and I thought 'what am i going to use this for since I intended to have the baby in his crib right away.' Well, I had a c-section and getting in and out of bed twenty times a night was not feasible, nor comfortable. Any woman who is having a c-section REALLY NEEDS THIS ITEM 
We use this constantly in every room of our house. Let's you keep the baby in bed with you without fear of rolling over on him, and makes any flat surface into a comfy baby bed 
This sleeper is awsome. My daughter is 4 weeks old and sleeps 7.5 hour stretches in it. I can pick her up and breast feed her and put her right back down, I think all the lack of moving around helps her get right back to sleep. She is right there with me al night and sleeps sooo soundly. Maybe it is the "4th trimester" feeling that helps her to be so calm. Whats great is that she sleeps the same way in it for day time naps without me there in bed with her. A must have! 
The features that make it good: there is a flap on the head end that tucks behind AND under your mattress to keep it in place. The top portion is molded plastic, with a decent height, which is helpful if you're a toss/turner - you won't roll over onto it. The lower half is mesh, which one assumes is to allow air circulation, but I think it's mostly that way to allow it to fold, and be portable. There is a foam wedge at the foot end to prevent baby from "scootching" out of it. HOWEVER, this makes the sleeper short enough to only last maybe 3 months (more or less, depending on the length of the baby). I've read that other buyers had a "split mattress," but mine was not split, but was one piece. After being folded, it was obviously bent in the middle, but I solved that by just flipping the mattress over for that use. I suppose that the split mattress was designed after complaints of the mattress being bent, so not a great change in my opinion. I also liked the nightlight - just bright enough to let us see the baby, without waking her up fully. It is sized so that it would best fit in a king size bed (if you have 2 parents in bed), but we managed with a queen. After reading other reviews, and thinking about my own use of this sleeper, I've come to a conclusion: The length may be too short to use it for long, however, once baby outgrows it lengthwise, it's probably time to get him out of your bed, as he is too mobile to be in a sleeper of this design. So perhaps good planning on The First Years part 
This is a great sleeper, BUT unfortunately it is too small and our 2.5 month old son has almost overgrown it. He loves to sleep in it and feels everywhere at home if he can sleep in his little bed. If there were an "extending" option we would be very very happy, but the way it is we can only use it for another couple of weeks 
We loved the idea of this item...we didn't use it in our bed but in the crib instead of a bassinette, when we were away from home, or on the sofa. Our son was 22" at birth so he outgrew this (unfortunately!) by the time he was a month old. It is really only suitable for small babies. Also, the "mattress" is split in two due to the folding capacity (not sure how else to do this though) which makes it seem somewhat less comfortable. Only one half has a removable, washable cover. 
You will never regert getting this. This is one of the must have, put up in attic till next time items 
My 2 yr old son was not interested in potty training until this. We bought this potty chair and it instantly got his attention. He went from not going potty to going potty all the time. I bought one for my sister- in -law who had 2 boys she was trying to potty train and couldn't keep them interested and was only having a big mess and within 2 weeks this totally got her boys on track. So I would absolutly reccomend this to anyone having troubles or struggling with potty training and for little boys, the combo of this and peter potty is unbeatable and quick at getting the task done. When we started my son on this, within a week 1/2 he was in boxers and going all day and night with no troubles. You will really appreciate this!! Good Luck! 
My son thought the toys attached to the potty were really interesting, and the sounds kept him entertained. It helped him get over the fear of sitting on the potty. We did have to move to the regular potty to actually get him to use the potty though. 
This product was so realistic that my granddaughter knew how to use it right off the start. She decided it was time to learn before my daughter was ready to train her. Success on the first try 
This is my first review-only because I disagree with all the negative reviews on this and this potty chair is so wonderful. This potty is easy to clean and very easy for the little ones to use all by themselves. My son will be 3 in 4 months(and he is big for his age) and this potty is not too little for him. He loves the music and it is not distracting to him or too much fun. I however did not use the splash guard as I didn't see the need so I dont know if it falls off easily or not. We had tried everything to potty train him and this chair along with letting him go without pants or diapers on or making sure his training pants are easy for him to pull up and down is the only thing that has worked. He gets to use it by himself and he even dumps it into the real toilet afterwards and he gets very excited about it 
This is a wonderful product... whenever it says or sings anything it brings a bright smile to my sons face. Very easy to assemble and just plain great 
The potty is really neat. My son loves it. I have only found one problem with it. If my son sits on the potty and moves it starts saying he pottied and he didn't. Other than that it's great 
I have to admit that I was shocked to read all the negative reviews on this stroller. I have loved it from the day my daughter was born, almost 2 years ago, and am now using it with my son. It's very lightweight and easy to steer. I never have a problem maneuvering it through the mall or in stores, even in the tightest of spaces. My daughter loves that she can sit forward and see the world around her, and I love that she can be buckled into a 5 point harness at the same time!!! After 2 years of pretty constant use and being tossed into and pulled out of my car trunk and my husband's truck, the stroller still looks brand new. The fabric is easy to clean and very durable. I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side. If these particular features are on your "most important" list, I might think about buying a full-sized stroller or travel system, not one of the Italian brands. Europeans just don't understand our fascination with gallon-sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets...just look at their cars and you'll understand. However, if you're looking for a stroller that can function well both as your everyday standard stroller and as your travel lightweight stroller, go with the Aria. 
We bought this stroller to take on a recent trip to Europe and it was the perfect travel stroller. I did a lot of research on strollers and I was really leaning towards getting a Maclaren, but when we went and actually looked at all the different strollers this one stood out. It's much lighter than the Maclaren and it has a snack tray, which is incredibly useful if your child is old enough to use a sippy cup and nibble on crackers, etc. (We bought this for our then 1.5 year old.) We must have gotten lucky, because I've never had any problems with the wheels like some reviewers have mentioned, and I can steer this with one hand easily. The seat reclines nearly all the way down and the basket underneath was useful for carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags. It does take two hands to close, which is little bit annoying. It's also kind of bulky even when it's closed. The sun visor is too small to do much good, so I wound up throwing my baby sling over it at times to help block the sun for my little guy. (It seemed like every travel stroller we saw had this problem though.) It's very light weight and is easy to carry when it's closed. My husband carried this up and down tube stations all over London (along with a backpack and our five year old at times) and he didn't have any problems. We also traveled to Eastern Europe for a few weeks and this stroller got a serious workout in both the city and the countryside. It held up really well and we're still using it as our second back up stroller. The only bad thing is the sippy cup attachment came off during the flight back and we haven't been able to find a replacement. Also the grown-up cup holder is a complete joke and fell off after only a few uses. Overall though, I'm really pleased with this stroller and would buy it again. 
With the Tummy time mat baby enjoys a lot.I gave this as gift for my friend's kid they liked it very much.Esply with aquarium theme it looks nice.Kids enjoy the waterpart on the mat .I wud definitely recommend this item to anyone 
This was a great activity for our little girl for the first few months. The pillow really helped her to lift her head way up and check out the world, and the toys were fun to manipulate. She still plays with the crab at 8 months. Unfortunately, our cat REALLY liked the water-filled fish pillow, so he chewed a hole in it. I figure that's my fault for not putting the toy away at night... Our baby still enjoyed the toy without water 
My daughter has really enjoyed this mat. In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish(she looooves fish), but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased. Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash. As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though. 
This is such a cute surfboard! The chains come off of the board for taking them other places as you go! Also, the water and "sea life" inside the pouch are so cute! My son loves it 
This was the only way we could get our newborn to do tummy time. Flat on his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head at all just freaked him out and he'd cry and cry. But with the little raised pillow, it would keep him from having his face smoshed into the floor and he'd be more patient with trying to look around. Now that he's 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn't really need the extra booster pillow, and he didn't start playing with the water bit until 3 months. Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn't hold. But the little attached toys are very nice - we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time. But I think it's very nice for a baby as they learn head control so that it lifts them a bit off the ground so they don't panic as much 
For $35 or so, this is a good value. The rails are sturdy enough to keep a kid from rolling out of bed, even if it's not set up exactly right. Length adjusts easily. It's hard to keep the straps fastened correctly underneath the mattress, though, especially if it's a heavy mattress. They supposedly fold down to the sides, too, but I still haven't been able to get that mechanism to work 
I purchased two gates and couldn't be happier with them. I have two Italian Greyhounds; one is a 13 week old puppy; and it was always scary going out the front door and returning through it wondering if they would bolt out. Now I have a gate in the entry way, so I can go through the gate, close it behind me, and go in and out of the front door without worrying they will get loose. The other gate is used for the kitchen. I can just put the dogs in there when I am busy doing something and can't keep an eye on them. These gates arrived within two days of my order. Shipping was free through Amazon. I could not have found a better deal anywhere! They were super easy to put together and install. I had both of them unpackaged, and installed within 15 minutes. No tools necessary. And they are very sturdy, and look good, too! It took me a few times to figure out how to easily open the swing door, but once you get it, it is really easy. This is definitely one of the best purchases I have ever made through Amazon 
I finally got smart with the 3rd child and bought these gates (3 of them) instead of those kind that you push down to lock into place and they fall over, these gates are so secure and really tall, my cats have a hard time jumping over them. My friend has this gate also and has an 80 pound dog and he hasn't been able to budge it. We have a really big doorway from our hall to living room and we were able to use 2 of the bigger 10" extenders and it fit perfectly. Each gate comes with a 5" and a 10" extender. I would highly recommend these gates 
I highly recommend this gate and have actually have purchased 3 of them, 2 online and 1 in the store. Very versatile with the different width sections which can be added. Really like the extra height as they are being used for a puppy who can really jump!! Also like the ability to swing gate in either direction 
By far the best baby gate I have ever used. Needed to keep baby on one side and dogs on the other yet still be able to walk through. This gate was simple to set up, and is tall enough to keep the dogs (Boxers) from jumping over! Then the swinging door lets you go from room to room with a simple push of a tab. Highly recommended, and I plan to buy another one once the grandbaby starts moving 
I needed a gate for an odd sized doorway and looked at all of them at least twice. This gate was a great bargain with the extensions included(which is expensive to buy separately with the other gates). I have found it to be very sturdy with no movement or realignment when it closes. I didn't want to use hardware to install it and have never had a problem with the bar on the bottom. I installed it with my 9 month old tugging and climbing on me with no problems. It has a good appearance and is easy to operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries). I have received many good comments by visitors and I am very glad I picked this one. 
I bought it initially to keep my dogs out of the living room and what I love about it is that it is extra tall, therefore my dogs cannot jump over it! Now that I am pregnant I know I will love it even more 
We have one at the bottom of our stairs and one between the kitchen and basement stairs. Easy to install and easy to operate. I dont see our daughter being able to figure it out any time soon unlike some of the others we looked at. The only flaw is the squeak. They can be a bit loud when you open and close them but they are sterdy and convienent 
I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews. We wore this sling with both babies, and even when they were toddlers and wanted to be carried (try THAT with a snuggli!) I always kept one hand on the newborn (I wanted to, anyway), but Daddy didn't. As they grew, the sling accommodated different positions with a tug of the strap: front facing, side hip, on my back so I could work in the kitchen. Fit easily over any layers. BEST FEATURE: we could transfer a sleeping baby (or toddler) from one caregiver to another, or lay sleeping child down for nap, without jiggling the wee one out of a carrier or wrestling with readjusting multiple carrier straps to fit different sized people. Our babysitters and friends wore this sling, too 
I got this sling when my first son was 1.5 months old and I was trying to shop in Target. He was screaming in his car seat so I put it on right in the store!!! I liked it because I could nurse him in it while wearing a nursing top - much easier than in the Bjorn, and nobody can see what you are doing. The padded lip on the sling is actually really great, it helps prop the baby's head up, and also keeps them from slipping out, which almost happened with a sling my cousin lent me. I am now using it with my second son, and sometimes I can slip the sling off me when he is sleeping and tuck it around him and he stays asleep, although you have to make sure you place it in such a way that the ring doesn't get in the way or the baby doesn't get tangled in the "tail." I don't do this all the time, but it is a nice way to get him to sleep when he's really having a hard time, and because the sling smells like mommy, he feels comfy. I've taken the sling everywhere, and my older son still likes to be in it, even though he's a tad over the weight limit. I didn't give it 5 stars because as really tiny infants my sons did not like this. Now though, we use it a lot around the house when we don't want to fiddle with the Bjorn - a great way to deal with separation anxiety. If you are really clever, there is a way to wear it so you can have an older child on your back. My older son likes that a lot! 
My husband and I take turns carrying our youngest in his carrier my husband loves it hands down compared to the coventional harness carrier. He feels more in touch with his son and very close to him. He can position him which ever way is most comfortable for the task at hand wheather it be sleeping, sitting, walking or just cuddling 
I bought the NoJo sling before my daughter was born in feb 2002 and was looking forward to using it for breastfeeding and getting around without the hassel of a stroller or carseat.It was the best friend that I needed being a new mother. Life was so much easier with it and still is.My daughter is two and I use this sling still and she's grown so much more since then.Thanks NoJo for making life for me and my husband so easy and fun.The malls and grocery stores will never be the same.Plus the mopping of our home is made easier because she just holds on and watches safe and out of the way from her sling, which is also like her blankie.Thank you, Jennifer and Celeste from Miami,Florida 
These books are great! They're plastic so you can wipe them off and flexible so your child can't hurt themselves when the inadvertently wack themselves in the head with it. The buttons are easy to push and they love pressing the buttons on each page. My kid even grabs my hand and helps me press the button. And of course, it's fun to sing along 
I bought all of this seperately for my son but this would have been a great gift to recieve! I especially love the foam shampoo and cleansing fluid. Mustela products smell SO good 
My grandson loves this walker. He is not yet able to walk but he sits in the seat and loves the music and lights 
My baby just turned four months when I ordered this walker in February. Although the pediatrician recommended no walkers at this age, I used my judgement and decided since our home was one level, and I am home all day, I could watch my baby safely while he was in the walker. When the walker arrived, I read the instructions and assembled the walker in 20 minutes. I place him in the walker and used some baby blankets to help prop his trunk muscles so he could sit upright. He didn't cry and this was all new to him. I pushed, pulled him until he told me he was tired. He's now five months and can propel himself backwards and side to side in small steps. He hasn't moved forward too much, but of course that will change. In short, this walker is safe, durable and resonable priced. The colors and rocket shape is a bit funky retro. I did remove two items off the "control panel", the two arched movable toys, because it was too much. The nice thing as well as the control panel comes off completely to reveal a tray. The seat also easily detaches and just throw it in the washer/dryer. Rest of the walker can be cleaned by wiping with soap and water. There are three height level adjustments to the walker. And the walker collapes for storage. To summerize, I would definately recommend this walker, for it's durablility, practicality and to increase motor skills, perception for the baby 
I have a Safety 1st walker that is similar (Winnie the Pooh) and my girl loves it. In fact, she doesn't want to be in her Hop N Pop as much because she scoots around in her walker. I got my walker from Kmart (and you can change the batteries in the Hunny Pot). I wasn't going to get her a walker at all and just use her Hop n Pop but she seems to really like being in it. 
My 7 month old son started to walk in this walker in 2 week. Height is adjustable only in 2 positions. You might want to consider if your baby is small, my 7 month old height is 95% and he reaches the floor on his tip toes first. 
What a great walker... and it's so inexpensive! My baby girl just loves to be in it. It's built her upper body strength up and she can sit on her own now. I'm sure she'll be an early walker now also. I like that the top can be easily taken off and cleaned or we can put other toys in it's place to change up the scenery. I'm so glad I got it 
I bought this safe padded sheet for my four month baby, it's perfecto to safe the sheet and breathe. Good quality, and nice price 
You said it New Mommy from Maryland, I can't understand the below comments. This product is a must have, do yourself a huge favor and buy two of them, trust me you will only thank yourself at 2am! Worth every penny! After washing mine they smelled like downey and felt soft. My crib mattress fits so snug and tight that I can't lift it out of the crib to put a new crib sheet on the mattress. I have had mine for 3 years now and they have held up very well 
We received one of these as a gift when our first child was born. We then bought a second (one to wash and one to use, as someone else said), and when our second child was born one year after the first, we got a third pad. We also used them under the sheets of the full-size bed when the kids graduated to that (though they tend to shift, and you have to position them in the key area, but it protected the mattress and was more comfortable than the full-size waterproof mattress pads). This is now the very practical gift that I give to any new parents or parents-to-be. It saved me tons of time and effort, and I just like to pass on the favor to others. Very practical, not very cutsie, but extremely useful and generally well-appreciated by anyone who uses it 
soft, easy to attach, absorbs well, don't have to lift mattress to change, can still see cute sheet from side of crib 
I brought this item for my son as a gift for his second birthday and he absolutely loves it! The crayons dont stain your tub or walls and its very easy to clean. Wonderful item for bath time fun 
My son, who just turned two, heartily enjoys this toy. The only major complaint I have about it is that while it has compartments on both sides of the "canvas" for storing the crayons, those compartments are not easy for me to open, much less a 2-year old. The compartments have an indentation where one is presumably supposed to squeeze and open the chamber, but it doesn't work so well for us. This has actually become a little maddening and frustrates my little one. A small quibble, but it would be great if this toy were slightly modified to make the compartments a little easier to get in to 
I only wish the crayons were thicker so they wouldn't break so quickly! I purchased this for my 20 month old and she absolutely loves this. She comes to the shower when I'm in it saying "color" and tries to get in just to color with it on the wall! I will put her in the shower and let her color while I shower, then get out, and let her continue to color while I'm getting dried off then bathe her. She actually hates getting out of the bathtub now! I'd recommend this to anyone with children who love to draw or color. The crayon marks are easily removed off of any tile or ceramic tub (though I don't know how well it would work with those plastic/laminate ones) and with the side compartments to hold the crayons in with the holes so the crayons can dry, there's no crayons lying all over the bathtub. The most used Christmas gift yet (and even loved by my 9 year old son!) 
I got this for my 2 year old and it'll keep her busy for a good while. She loves coloring, LOVES IT! The only problem I have with this is that she won't keep the crayons in their little holders and the crayons break easy. Which is what crayons are wont to do in little hands. I think Crayola would have been better served making these a bit thicker for tiny yet strong hands. The same way they have those super big crayons for pre-school. Another thing, you may consider just getting the bath crayons. The board is cute, but Lydia prefers a bigger canvas and only used the board for a few moments before moving onto the great big tub and tile. Don't fool yourself, they're going to color on the tile. (; Wipes away easy enough though! If you go to Babies R Us, you will find Baby Einstein crayons for $3.99. A nice replacement with the same sleeves included. Colors include Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black and Orange. ETA: The easiest way I've found to clean the tub after a couple of sessions of crayon play it to spray the surfaces with Scrubbing Bubbles, let it sit for a few moments, and wipe away. There is a bit more elbow work required otherwise 
My 6 yr old son loves this one. He can draw and use his imagination, unlike the floating dolphin musical rings. It suction cups to the shower wall, has compartments for the crayons. Well worth the money. 
3 yr old was fighting each night to take bath, now asks to take bath. Great toy. Adult needed to open the crayon compartments (and I have a hard time -- nothing to grasp on), but she learned to hold them open to keep from closing. Crayon is suprisingly dark, and yet easy to rub off. She cleans the surface herself with a wash cloth 
This bouncer model is the best available currently on the market, even though there are few flaws and room for improvement, as other Amazonians pointed out. But it does work and keeps our baby entertained, while leaving parents some much needed time for other important things around the house. Sounds and lights are easily activated by baby's movement, but volume can not be adjusted. Vibration mode could keep baby amuzed for about 1/2 hour first month, but later our baby got used to it and does not care for it as before. We also like to use this bouncer without play bar, as simple comfy chair. This way baby could listen see parents or watch together 'Baby First' TV. I higly recommend this product to new parents or as baby shower gift 
This seat is for our 3 month old daughter who weighs 15 pounds. First, I'll point out the pros of this bouncer seat. The music is wonderful. The waterfall is captivating. The colors are mesmerizing. She can sit in the seat for 25 minutes easily. The seat takes 4 D-size batteries. Unlike other bouncer seats we have used, there is only one compartment for 4 D-sized batteries. Unlike its predecessor (the Ocean Wonder Aquarium), the Rainforest bouncer keeps our child AWAKE. If we wanted our child to sleep, we'd put her in bed, not the bouncer. So Fisher Price definitely got it right this time! A++! The cons is that the seat was used twice before it started to make this loud clicking noise from the bar. Being an engineer, I took it apart and noticed that the gears are designed to click (or skip a gear) if a child were to grab the frog or the monkey while it is moving. This prevents the gears from being stripped or the motor overheating. However, the tension on this "gear skipping" behavior is too sensitive such that after 3 hours of use, the clicking occurs from just the friction of the frogs moving up and down on the bar. I called customer support about the clicking and they promptly sent a replacement bar. After 2 weeks of using the new bar, it started clicking. Argh! The good thing is that the new bar does it randomly. We're willing to live with the flaw and the annoying clicking from time to time for the Pros listed above. The other con is questionable. There is much debate about the height of the toys on the bar. Being an "infant" bouncer, it is designed such that the child can grab the toys and even pull the rings off the monkey. Our daughter loves it! We do have the Fisher Price "Kick and Play" which is designed for slightly older children in that it provides more clearance between the child and the toys ... hence "Kick and Play." The bouncer comes with a one-year warranty. So for a year, I can get replacement bars as the clicking becomes annoying. After replacing enough of them, will their engineers will fix the problem? I hope so. 19 March 2007: The clicking has returned with the replacement bar and won't go away. I called Fisher Price for a replacement bar. While they really wanted to send a voucher for $48, I pressed to have another toy bar sent as a replacement. At that point, customer service informed me that there is a backlog of replacements on this bar till 30 April 2007. Customer service continues to be very friendly and easy to deal with. We're willing to wait for the new bar ... 
My son thoroughly enjoys playing in the bouncer. However, approximately three weeks after receiving the bouncer, the toy bar began making a horrible clicking noise. I telephoned Fisher Price and their customer service was great. They immediately sent me out a complimentary replacement toy bar, no questions asked. Overall I am quite happy with the bouncer and Fisher Price 
I bought this for my 2 month old for christmas. My baby loves it. My baby will sit in it for hours 
My son had no colic or gas while using these bottles. It is well worth the extra time spent cleaning the bottle parts when you never have to stay up all night because your baby has digestive discomfort. I used these with both formula and breast milk and they worked wonderfully. Dr. Brown's have many nipples to adjust the flow for your child so these bottles really grow with your baby. 
I have heard and read numerous articles on how good this product is out there on baby bottles. SO I went out and bought 2 sets. They are wonderful to have; I would recommend them to any new parents out there to use for their newborn 
This bottle solved these problems for us: Gas Spit Up Milk leaking out of baby's mouth low birth weight(she just wouldn't eat much) My baby started out life as a breastfeeder and at 2 weeks was diagnosed with a milk allergy. She was not gaining weight. She was switched to soy. I didn't want to try these bottles. I tried Gerber, Evenflo, Playtex, Avent. My mom read that they helped with colic and so she brought me one. I used that one bottle for two days until I could get to the store. Since then, I have retried all of those other bottles. She started eating less and losing more of it out the side of her mouth and spiting up again. This is her favorite. So it is worth it to me 
My son and daughter-in-law report that of all the baby bottles that they've tried, Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles are the easiest to use, and my grandson has a much easier time with any possible after-effects of bottle feeding times 
This is the second set of Doctor Browns that I have bought online. No other bottle will do now for my little one. It was suggested to me by my doctor and friend to try these bottles, since my baby had alot of gas. The only negative I had heard is that it takes a little longer to take the bottle apart, but it isn't a negative for me at all...it takes a second, and boy is it worth it. I can't recommend them highly enough. 
I think these pacifiers are great; they work either way so at night you don't have to feel around for a notch to make sure they're going in the right direction. They don't leave marks around my baby's mouth like another pacifier did. I believe the company is European, maybe that's why they're not as widespread in the U.S., but they're made well. The attachment is so useful, especially when you're out and about with the baby. Just imagine the horror when the pacifier drops out of the baby's mouth onto the germ-filled floor and there's no bathroom in sight to wash the pacifier 
Our toddler boy still enjoys this for naptime and asks for certain sound combinations. With our little daughter due soon, we decided rather than taking it away from our son, we will buy as second one for our daughter's room. It was very effective for our son his entire life so far. 
nice clear sounding device. Hopefully it will help with sleep for the baby 
I love this white noise machine. I read somewhere that people did not like it because it was not loud. I think it is plently loud enough. I was just going for a little noise for the baby to listen to as she can not sleep in silence, not wanting to hurt her hearing and drown out everything else in the house. Lots of variety on the settings and has a plugin so that batteries are not always needed. 5 Stars 
I ordered this for my grandson and he loved it. It makes just enough white noise that he is able to sleep. He lives in town and the country can be really quiet sometimes. It is a great machine and we are enjoying it 
This product is really great. It is an inexpensive white noise maker to help baby sleep. I like that I can plug it in and it runs all night. Now when my son wakes at night he can settle himself back to sleep and it also helps him nap longer during the day. The only negative is that it does not remember your standard settings every time you turn it on. Each time you turn it on the volume is on low and the sound is the ocean. Also, if you have a power outage, the battery backup will kick in, however, not before the sound resets to low volume ocean sounds. I will say that I think I sleep better hearing the "rain" over the monitor 
This product shipped fast and was in good condition except for a small dent in the side rail which I did not notice until I put the crib together and threw away the box, otherwise it was in good condition. It's nice and easy to move from room to room and small enough to fit in tight spaces 
These are sturdy cribs that hold up well. I own a daycare and these are used a lot daily. They still look new! I have had some for 3 years 
I've not bought one of these yet, but after seeing it in person, we're definitely getting one in a couple months for our new baby. It's very small, great for our 1bdr NYC apartment. People that have reviewed this previously don't mention the incredible amount of space this would save in a small living area. Since we don't have an extra room for our child, this will be perfect. Seems much more sturdy than any of the wood portable cribs. As for the particle board under the mattress, you could very easily reinforce it with another board, or metal braces. You can remove the wheels if, at a later time, it worries you that your toddler would be standing in the bed. It has 2 adjustable heights. Seems really good to me 
I think for space challenged households, this is the way to go! The chair fits perfectly on our dining chair so our little girl can sit with us while we eat. The height adjustments work so that the tray will slide over the top of dining table, so you don't have to keep the chair pushed away from the table. An all around great product! 
This chair is good for places that are small, I started using it when my daughter was sitting with support, and it was really good for her, it saves space, provides support, and is comfortable, I fully recommend this chair to anyone, and it is very affordable as well.. 
I LOVE IT! MY SON CAN SIT AT THE TABLE WITH US AND TAKE A NAP. HE IS ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD. IT LOOKS GREAT AND WILL BE WITH OUR FAMILY FOR YEARS TO COME. EASY TO SET UP AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT WILL TRASITION INTO A TODDLER SEAT 
The model Amazon sells is J5933, but there is a new 2007 model, L1907. Amazon doesn't sell the new model apparently and I don't know what the differences between them are. I checked the Fisher-Price website and it doesn't say, but they list both models. I ordered mine from Amazon on March 9, 2007. The chair was exactly what we were looking for. Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space. The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps. It also has non-skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners. The 3-point to 5-point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place. We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7-month old kept slouching underneath the tray. The countoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that. The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use. I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat, but I guess it's a nice option to have. The chair reminds me of a car seat, and as such, keeps our baby in place while feeding. The one-handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options. I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair. Perhaps a built-in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something. Just kidding : 
I highly recommend this product. Comfortable for baby. Easy to clean. No big highchair sitting around your kitchen all the time. Can slide chair to table with highchair in the seat. Good safety harness keeps child securely in place. No slouching or sliding down. Converts to booster when child is older. Definately think it's worth the money 
love it...started using it as soon as my daughter was born...she hated heavy clothing/sweaters and like... and this worked like a charm.. 
We bought this because our son was quickly outgrowing his car seat and big snow suits and coats made it that much tighter, so by using this we didn't have to put them on him. Fit very good on our graco car set, kept baby warm and it's a lot easier to just zip this down when you get somewhere rather than take coats on off. I will be stashing this away to use if I have another baby, wish I bought it sooner. 
I bought this for my new grandson and my daughter has told me how great it is. She doesn't have to bundle him up constantly, just put him in this and he is ready to go. Plus it keeps him nice and warm and we live in a cold climate 
We absolutely love the Bundleme. It is so much easier to just tuck her into it than try to wrestle her into a snowsuit or wrap her up in multiple blankets. She is happier and calmer and so are we. It just makes taking her out so much easier, faster and less stressful on all of us. And it has definitely kept her warm this winter. In fact, we have to be careful in the car to make sure we unzip it and pull it down because she gets too hot during trips that last longer than a few minutes. I have recommended this to my sister in law who is pregnant and am considering buying a Bundleme Lite for this spring and possibly next fall if my daughter still fits into it because I have been so pleased with how the original has worked out for us 
This is the most comfortable carrier I have tried, and the easiest to put on. The shoulder-cupping theory works well in practice, at least with my son who is 7.5 kilos right now. The carrier itself is well made and the clasps are nice to have instead of having to tie it on. I would say that mobility is a tad limited because if you have to reach for anything high up the shoulder strap slips up around my neck, but otherwise I was able to do stuff around the house while wearing my son, and we were both comfortable 
I love this rail. It's the perfe ct size and easy to put up and down. Yes, it is very difficult to get together because the fabric is so taut that you have little room to manuever. It was very easy to attach to the bed and adjust once it was up. I'm looking to buy another one for our shore house 
I agree with the other posters -- this pillow's stuffing has not held up like I'd expect from a Boppy. It's almost as if someone besides Boppy made it and put the Boppy label on it; but the design is exactly what I've come to expect from Boppy: innovative and unbeliveably useful. I have been using this pillow since I was 6 months pregnant, and my baby is now almost 17 months old. I just can't give it up. My husband and I fight over it so much (he loves it, too, calls it the "comma pillow"), I'm considering getting him his own for Christmas! The shape provides so much back and bip support, even when you're not pregnant. I honestly don't think I would have gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn't been for this pillow, and the little tail (small end of the pillow) can provide amazing support for your lower back when you're nursing on your side (which means I was able to get sleep during those first few months of "sleepless" nights, also!) My pillow came with a washable case, so I toss that in the washer. The pillow did start to separate after a few months, but I've tried to keep it fluffed regularly; and I think that's helped it stay in one piece instead of separating fully into two sections. All in all, I highly recommend this pillow; but, as one other poster noted, it's a matter of personal taste -- and body shape -- as to whether it will become your favorite or be deemed a poor investment. I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and will likely buy another one when this one wear out -- even if I don't have another baby 
I got this pillow when I was about 5 months pregnant because I was needing something between my legs for my hips. I am now 39 weeks pregnant and I can't imagine sleeping without it. It makes rolling over easy and it stays between your legs so there is no need to adjust when you roll over. The part that goes under the belly provides just the right amount of support and isn't too big and bulky. I will even be taking this with me to the hospital for while laboring! I love the boppy prego pillow 
I have used this pillow since the beginning of my pregnancy and it is wonderful. No problems with the stuffing becoming lumpy or mis-shapen. Great for releaving hip pain and as a stomach sleeper, it allows you to sleep on your side with similar comfort to stomach sleeping by leaning into the pillow. I highly recommend it 
After my 20 month old figured out how to "escape", I felt this option was best as I knew if we put him in a toddler bed, the entire family would be up all night hearing him scream at the gate. Pros: really works even for hard-core escape artists, made well, makes me feel much better knowing that he is safe. Cons: Can't hang any crib toys, can't use "The Ultimate Crib Sheet" (which is one of the best baby products ever), your child will HATE it at first, the mesh is kinda rough so my little mad one has red "face burns" from rubbing on it. Biggest downside: TOO EXPENSIVE!!! I feel since this company, as far as I know, is the only one making this, they feel they can charge this much just b/c desperate parents have no other option. Overall: love the product, HATE the price 
well, i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out of the crib again. he had done this months earlier, when the crib was not on the lowest setting, so that time the problem was easily solved. this time, not so easily...i was so afraid he would crack his head open on our hard mexican tile floors! many of the other moms wrote how their kids seemed to love it. wsh i could say that! i love it, because i know it is protecting my child from a potentially very harmful fall. but, he REALLY was freaked out by it the first few nights. i think it would be nice if it were to go higher up, have a higher arch, thus not making it feel so confining, so much like being caged in. so he didn't like it at all, but, it has been five or six nights now and he is used to it, and simply checks it out, then rolls over and goes to sleep. but it did cost us some tears. (i'm not talking hours here, five minutes max, on the worst night). anyways, all in all, i think it is a great product for all parents who want to protect their little monkeys from potential injuries. 
Our toddler was always very active since he was born so when he got his foot stuck in the side rails we upgraded to this one from the Crib Tent I. I couldn't imagine not having this. I have peace of mind and don't have to worry about my son climbing out OR getting himself stuck again. Fantastic invention!! 
I don't find too many things anymore that exceed my expectations.This product is one of them.My son is strong and active.He would constantly climb out of the crib and would land on the floor head first.On one of those occasions he had to go to the hospital because he hurt himself bad.I did not know what to do until I went online and found this product.It saved us all.I put it together myself and it was pretty simple and best of all it works.I thought that my son would have been able to break it because he is strong but that is not the case.He likes it.It keeps him in and he even thinks it is a tent to play in.It is Cozy.No more scares.The zipper does make alot of noise and I have had to sew a few spots because the seam is so tight it tends to rip in a few spots.I purchased it in December and I am still talking about it. GREAT PRODUCT 
We have used these tents with both of our sons since they learned how to climb (or fall as the case may be) out of their cribs on their own at 18 months of age. Now, we know they are safe and secure and totally happy "camping" in their cribs. We do have traditionally designed cribs, so attachment issues have not been a problem and we are able to lower the moveable side of their cribs with little difficulty. We have had to do a little needlework on one of the tents as the mesh separated from the edging material attached to the crib. But it was a one time repair and is holding up well. We did have to anchor the zipper to one of the velcro straps after each boy learned how to open the zippers on their own. We initially used a ribbon loop under the tent pole end and later utilized a carabiner clip and the velcro strap for more easy access. We always bring the tents with us on vacation if we will be using standard cribs. Love this product and the safety it provides to the boys 
I love this item because it's perfect for the diaper bag or in the car. It has been handy to me when my baby wasen't feel well I was able to take her temp. then give her medicine without having to open five differnt bags 
"me love mine potty! mi mommy liks it also and got me too of dem!!! even dough mine fwends wowe undies,me didn't kare-me liked diapers but wen mommy getted me dis comfy potty,i never gonna go in mi diapers ever again.i luv it cuz i can do it bi miself like mi mommy and daddy!!!weneva i need to go i just go an sit down.it is so cozy dat me dozent mind sitting on it for while.sinc it is ony too peices,when im dunn i can just spill it in da toilet and wipe itwith potty wipes*and its all cleen for next time!" Mom's Commentary;This potty is really fantastic!I bought two of them-one for upstairs and one for downstairs.I especially like the white one because it gives a clean look.All the other pottys I've tried either had lots of grooves and peices that were hard to clean and deal with or were only one piece which we would have a whole "operation clean-up" after each use. As my child mentioned,she can spill it in the toilet and then clean it with CLOROX WIPES.(she calles them "potty wipes"*) The rubber strip on the bottom makes it stay where its put.I also bought the matching stool so that she can wash her hands and that stool proves to be great as well!I think that this potty deserves five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This chair works extremely well and is worth every penny. It is extremely easy to clean, and comfortable for a toddler to use. I would strongly recommend this potty chair to every parent 
I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son. We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size(He's 27lbs and 32 inches tall). He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. My son has even held onto one of the sides (while sitting on it) and leaned over to pick up one of his books and the potty didn't tip at all. One reviewer said the splashguard was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable splashguard and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull off the splashguard and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him to focus on going potty. I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair 
What a great potty seat!! The molded plastic makes clean up a breeze so you don't have a residual odor developing. My son loves it. It is also small enough it doesn't take up much room in the bathroom. And the color blends in nice. 
My 4 month old son absolutely loves this.We got it for him when he was 2 months old and this has been a lifesaver for us since then.He plays in it for over an hour at a time which gives me time to do other stuff around the house 
When I ordered the gym my baby was 2 months old, she is now 3 months old and it is the best thing since sliced bread!! Every morning she plays under it for one full hour. There is so much for her to do and the accessories are interchangable, so you can add toys lower toys raise toys.It is easy to pack up and take, so we take it when we visit relatives 
I recently purchased this item from a local babies r us, and my 2 month old LOVES it. She just lies there and stares at the light and music box. She to look at herself in the mirror. I love this gym, it enertains her while I try to get stuff in the house done. So happy I bought it. It is kinda pricey though, but in my opinion well worth it! 
My 7 month old has used this daily since he was 8 weeks. He loves it even more now. As he grows he finds new ways to play with the gym. He loves the music and lights especially. He will play on his own for 20 minutes at least. This is a lifesaver for me, I can use it to occupy him while I get ready in the morning, or any time I need to distract him, or just put him on the floor to play and know he'll stay in one place. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I think it's the one piece of baby gear I absolutely would not give up 
I Love it I Love it I Love it! My son is three and a half months old and quickly becomes bored and needs a new stimulus. This playmat is just the trick, I'm in heaven. When he tires of staring at the wide array of toys that are attached to the playard and playing with them he rolls over and pushes on the aqua part of the mat(his favorite part) then he rolls back over and stares at the lights and dancing fish on the detachable music box and happily laughs and kicks the cloth poles that hold the soft child safe and friendly toys above his head, he loves being able to control the movements of the toys above his head so much... and the cloth covered poles do not scare me as muc as the typical plastic ones, lastly he looks at himself in the mirror as he drifts off to sleep. He loves this mat and has finally given me some free time. The tummy time has doubled voluntarily since we recieved it in the mail. Defenitely worth the higher price! Also the biggest playmat of this type that I've found on the market will defenitely last me until far after we hit that crawling stage and then the detachable toys will still be usable. As will the mat for naptime. Thank you 
I use the mirror on my front windshield, so I can keep my rearview mirror on the road, and it hasn't fallen a time. I have a larger mirror that attaches to the back seat, where I can see my baby, and she can see herself. The seat protector is saving my leather, and I've had no issues at all with the sunshades. This is a great value for $9.99, as a seat protector alone costs about $13.00. If this stuff was all purchased separately, you'd pay about $30. I'm very pleased with this purchase 
This was the softest smoothest gift. I thank you for getting this for me on time 
Love it. My daughter would not sleep with out it 
I bought this for my newborn granddaughter "sight unseen". It's soft, warm, and works perfectly with the velcro closures. She also has some receiving blankets but hasn't used them at all for swaddling because this item works so well and is so convenient 
I don't have one of these but I am buying 4 of them for baby shower gifts. In reading the reviews there was mention of the velcro not sticking after a while. If you take a needle and pick the lint off the one side of the velcro that is the scratchier side it should work again. This will work for any velcro closer 
Our 10 week old daughter had not slept for three days. We had called the doctor and searched on the internet for suggestions to get her to sleep and keep us from going insane. I read a suggestion that colicky babies liked to be swaddled and remembered that we had a Swaddleme in the closet. It was so easy to put her in and she has slept well for the past three nights. I am so thankful for this product!! 
I bought one of these while pregnant w/our five-day-old daughter, and I never had anything like it w/our first two daughters. Let me just say, this one simple product renders ANY OTHER blanket obsolete. It's soft, pretty, cozy, easy to use (I was always lousy at swaddling w/regular receiving blankets!), impossible to get out of, and she loves it. I'm going out tomorrow to buy five more, LOL 
This was an awesome purchase. Especially if you have a newborn and a toddler. It really helps the toddler feel included and helps make the transition a lot easier. This stroller helped motivate me to get out and shop knowing that I would not have to chase my toddler through the mall. 
I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago. I have a 22 month old a 4 year old they love it... My 4 year old loves the fact that if she gets tired she can sit or stand in the back. We are going to NY in a couple of weeks and this is why I purchased this stroller because you have to walk everywhere, now I am sure that they will be OK. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it's a little heavier than I expected. Other than that i's great! I higly recommend it. I plan to have another child so I know I will keep this for a while! 
I am very pleased with my purchase. I have a 3 year old and daycare a 1 year old and 3 year old so wanted something that I could walk with the baby in and let the older ones rest when needed. This works great! It isn't hard on the wrists like I found most double strollers to be. Can be easily steered. The only things "missing" are the cup holder which you can buy and I think that rubber wheels would have better suited the stroller especially for outside strolls. But other than that I am very pleased 
Love it, no complaints!!! I have a 2 1/2 year old son and six month old daughter. We graciously accepted my sister's hand me down Evenflo 'Take me Two' double stroller before the arrival of my daughter. Not only was that ridiculously hard to move (it weighs 47lbs), but my son (weighing 35 lbs) would throw a 2 year year old fit and end up kicking the back seat of his sister's chair and send her flying forward. My children are both super tall and heavy. After loading them into my suv, loading the stroller was like a joke! After some extensive research, my Joovy arrived two days ago and have used it on a crazy expedition to Walmart (one week before Christmas, mind you!). My 2 year old is extremely picky and he hopped right in, and rode the whole time. He felt he was a 'big boy' and my daughter rested happily in the universal car seat attachement bar. She is also big enough to just sit up, so that is what I will try next. Both kids were comfy, content, and safe. It glides with ease, is a BREEZE to open and close (lift up two small levers with your fingers and it collapses). The construction is obviously very sturdy and high quality. And, it only weighs 24 lbs, yeah!!! LOVE IT, so glad I bought it, it will be a life saver. Thank you Joovy 
I got this for my daughter, who is very big for her age, and grew out of her infant tub at 6 months. She can sit up well, but I worried about her falling/slipping and hitting her head. This product is easy to use and works very well! The instructions tell you to make sure your tub is CLEAN and DRY, and you MUST follow these instructions if you want the suction cups to hold! BONUS--It covers up the lever that you flip up and down to stop up the tub, too! 
My son is very active in the tub and this product has made it totally safe for him in the tub. We added a rubber frog cover on the faucet and together he can play all he wants and we feel confident he won't fall and get hurt 
I have not used this product yet but the price was right, the quality of the product looks good, and I am looking forward to seeing the result of its use 
I like this product so much that I am taking PRECIOUS daddy sleep time to write this review at 3:00 am on what appears to be the tail-end (oh, God, please) of a week-long, growth spurt, every 1 1/2 to 2 hour Porky Pig feeding frenzy for my firstborn three week old. Granted, this took a few overheated bottles and a little practice to get it right. At first, we were pretty p.o.'d that we couldn't get this thing to heat consistently (my wife is a doc and I'm a lawyer so you'd think between the two of us we could heat up four ounces of milk, but nooooo--apparently you need a PhD in nuclear physics to accomplish this). After about ten tries, I started to get the feel for it, and now, I don't even measure the water- I just dump a bunch in and start counting. Going by time produces much more consistent results than relying on the water measuring, which if done with exact precision would probably work perfectly. For me, holding el porko in one arm and manipulating the faucet and water measuring flask is a bit rough, so again, for me, just counting off ten alligators and pulling the bottle works great. I'd recommed that the company devise a flask that utilizes a sliding mechanism and slot so that you get an exact amount of water each time with excess water spilling-off. As a sidenote, we use chilled expressed milk in Avent bottles and I find that: 1. leaving the lid on the bottles makes it easier to remove the four ounce bottles from the steaming warmer; 2. squeezing the nub? (the bulge right below the nipple tip) of the Avent bottle releases pressure built up by heating; 3. swirling the bottle gently after pulling it from the warmer is a good thing; and 4. a once a week cleaning seems to be about all the maintenance this thing needs. I griped to my mother about the sometimes inconsistent heat, to which she laughed and told me, "go boil some water, pour it in a cup, drop your bottle in, wait 10 minutes for the bottle to warm up, clean up the mess you made, then complain to me how hard you have it." Point well taken. Thinking about it, you'd need some sort of temperature probe or something to monitor the milk temp itself to really get exact results every time. Maybe they'll have some doodad like that by the time I have grandkids. This warmer, Avent bottles, and the hard-to-find Gerber Anti-Gas Relief Simethicone drops have made my life much, much easier (oh yah, and lots of Excederine and coffee too). The kid is fed, burped, and oh yah baby, sleeping so I am off to night night. Life is goooood 
I had to have 2 of these for the kitchen and bedroom but it overheats 4 oz bottles so you have to pay attention, and clean it often because the burned milk will cause the warmer to stink.It lasts for a long time, so its worth the investment. 
As a grandmother I find this easy and quick to warm bottles or baby food jars. Heats in very little time and easy to adjust temperature by adding or removing water. Wish I had this when my kids were little 
I really like this warmer. Its small and it works fast. There is a little water holder that attaches to the side of the unit to keep the water ready for when you need it. Just add the water, put in the bottle and wait 2-3 minutes. The only problem I have with the warmer is that I use water for the bottle that is room tempature so if I leave the bottle in the entire warming time it gets too hot for my baby to drink. So I just take it out after 1 minute, check it on my wrist and it is usually ready. If you are taking a cold bottle from the refridgerator and warming it, you can leave it for the full warming time of 2 - 3 minutes. I highly recommend this warmer 
This is my second First Years Warmer with my second child. The first one got TONS of use and lasted the whole first year of heating up bottles for my son. Now with another child, I decided I can splurge on a new one since the bottom was starting to burn out a bit. I highly recommend it. The bottles warm in about a minute and is very easy. It's all easy to do while holding a baby in one hand too. The only negative I see if I've yet to master how much water to throw in. It works by putting in a small amount of water right into the unit and then it heats up essentially steaming the bottle so it's an even warming process. The problem is most likely me because I never pay attention to how much water I'm putting in to note for the future if it was right or not. But worst case I do a little more a second time, or give a minute to cool down. Usually it's perfect. With all the choices out there, I highly recommend this one. 
This is a great product! I have bought 3 additional ones for baby showers after I used the first one myself. It is quick and easy. Although you have to guess how much water to put in the warmer, but you will get used to it pretty quickly. I can't live without it and recommend it to everyone 
I tried several types of nursing pads and found these to be by far the most comfortable. I never have a problem with leakage or "fuzzies" left behind by the pads. I actually had to throw away the box of johnson and johnson pads i had bought because they were so itchy and fuzzy, and i found the thinner types of pads to be too flimsy for me. While the avent pads are bulky, because i am not back into my normal slim-fitting clothes yet, i haven't had a problem with the pads showing through. 
I literally had every pad out there imaginable. I had the Gerer pads, the Medela pads, Curity pads and the hospital pads. None of them add up to the Advent ones, I even had the Especially for Baby pads those are actually just as good as the Advent pads. What makes them two pads slightly different is the Advent pads come with the nipple indent. I have both pads if your money concious the m buy the especially for babies brand. The advent pads hold so much fluid, it's not even funny. I leak so much all the time and it doesnt seep through my clothes. All of the other pads were to thin for me, and the tape that the others have is useless because it doesnt really stick to the bra 
I just got my 2007 Revolution and I absolutely love it. My 19 month old gave it his seal of approval when he refused to get out of it the first time he went for a ride. If he even sees it, he wants in it! The main differences between the 2007 and the 2006 are: 1. Increased seat recline of up to 70 degrees (earlier versions only recline to 45 degrees) 2. Increased back support on the seat back 3. Additional padding added to the seat Quite frankly, these improvements weren't a huge selling point for me. If my son was an infant, the increased seat recline might matter, but at his age he doesn't want to recline at all. The sun canopy is the biggest I've ever seen on a stroller. In the past I've had to put a blanket over the canopy to try and shield the sun from my son's eyes, but this canopy solves that problem. It is huge! As for maneuverability, the Revolution far surpasses any other stroller I've tried. It is a smooth, steady ride. I typically use the swivel feature, but the stroller is still great with the front wheel in the locked position. The storage basket is fairly large for a jogger and is sufficient for the typical walk or jog. I did take this stroller to the mall today and, while it was incredibly easy to maneuver through the mall, the storage basket was not large enough for shopping and storing packages along the way. It is very easy to fold and is fairly compact when it is folded, but it does not have a latching feature which makes picking it up a bit awkward. It's not a huge deal to me, though, since I usually leave it open and ready to go in our garage (thank God for 3-car garages!). I really like the 5 point harness and my son doesn't mind being buckled into the seat. He seems very comfortable and snuggles right in as soon as I put him in. The "cup holders" inside the seat are nice, but he has a hard time getting his cups into them which tends to frustrate him. An older child may not have an issue with this, though. The shock absorbers are really nice and work very well. We can "off road" in it and still have a nice smooth ride. If I hit an uneven area of pavement or branches/roots on the trail, it is barely noticeable. Overall I am very happy with this stroller. And, more importantly, it got my son's seal of approval 
These place mats are the greatest, you have children that want to feed their selves but also you can't give them a plate of their own without them dropping them and making a mess. the mats work great because tables are not always as clean as you would like and you can just gather up all of your mess at the end of the meal and throw it away 
I picked this up at my local BRUs store. I've had the snack cup only going on 6 yrs now on an umbrella stroller and got this set for my 3rd child's new Combi Savvy EX stroller. The stroller came with a soft pack accessory holder that angled with the handles of the stroller but I needed more drink holders for my 2 older children and us adults. It has WORKED PERFECTLY for us and I didn't have any problems installing the clamps - more details on that later. The very dark navy set (as pictured) blends well with my black silver stroller. This is what the set comes with and what it's for: 1) 2 clips/clamps with large small crews (used large screws to fit around the oval tubing of my stroller) and an allen wrench. I think more clips would've been nice so people could use more of the attachments so I'm going to try to find long screws to replace the small screws I used on the clip on my old umbrella stroller. 2) 3 different sized "C" shaped bottle holders (pop bottle in at the neck) Use small size for normal water bottles, medium for Gerber styled baby bottles wide-mouthed water bottles (i.e. Propel Gatorade) and large for Avent style baby bottles. 3) A big cup holder - it was already assembled so we haven't had problems with the arms popping out, as other reviewers have stated. It can be attached to the clips on 2 sides, one where the cup can swivel (why??? I don't know) or the other where it's stationary. 4) Double-cupped snack cup with connected lids that swivel open. 5) A mesh bag that is small (7 x 9.5 inches) but people - I think this bag is to hold all the attachment parts! 6) 2 large "S" hooks and 2 small "S" hooks. They do look flimsy but they work. Keep in mind, you aren't supposed to load up your stroller with heavy items anyway (so it won't tip over) so don't expect to hang your loaded cooler on it! We used both large hooks, one with a bag that held my Bjorn baby carrier and the other with a bag of snacks small pint sized water bottles in it. I do have the multi-colored "S" hooks from another manufacturer - they are very sturdy and do swivel but they will not fit on the tubes of this stroller. NOTE: I have not seen large enough hooks for the aluminum oval tubes of these newer strollers. So these will be very useful b/c the basket underneath our stroller does hold a good amount but not enough for a productive day at the mall :-) Other reviewers have rated this item low for what I think are unwarranted reasons or high expectations of an after-market stroller accessory. This item will not work on EVERY stroller out there. Yes, the big cup holder will stick out a bit but at the zoo or mall we haven't had anything fall out. Put some forethought into placement of the clamps and you won't be frustrated putting them on. RE: Installation: I recommend closing your stroller first and look it over for possible locations of the clamps. Then when first installing the clamps, test the closing of your stroller before totally tightening the screws. On our Combi, it goes right above the clamps that you pull that closes the stroller and right under the included accessory pack. Later when our baby starts eating snacks I can see a possible place for it right next to the seat frame but then the front rail of the stroller does have 2 cup holders on it so I think we'll really end up keeping the 2 clips up top for us. The location it's at now is angled and yes, your attachments will end up holding your drinks straight. The attachment pieces have an octagonal shape so when you pop the piece in, it can be straight. Taking the piece off is easy, you only need to hold the clamp with one hand and pull the piece off with another. DON'T FORGET to take these attachments off before closing the stroller and throwing it in the trunk of your car b/c the items may pop-off and get lost or they may break. This set has REALLY WORKED WELL for us and the price is good. We were set with drinks for the whole family for a full day at theme parks and the zoo! Good luck 
This is a very good product my wife and I have been trying to find somthine like this for months and we were very happy with this purches. We love how it is very fexable you an interchange the parts as you wish. The only thing that would make it any better is a lock so the kids can't take the attachments of 
I'm a mechanical engineer and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd have to pull out my tools to make this thing work on our Peg Perego P3 stroller. In fact, it went on quite easily. The key is to locate the clamps just below P3 logo on the brace that goes down toward the rear wheels. This allows the stroller to be folded up without removing the clamp - even if you have the large accessories like the snack tray or cup holder attached. I did have to slightly angle the cup holder out when the seat was reclined all the way back (because we snap in the car seat currently with our infant). I could not attach the clamps anywhere else on the stroller though due to the large oval tubing and necessity of folding it up. I'm impressed with the quality of the unit though. Do be sure to use the long bolts since the oval-shaped tubing makes it a little difficult to connect the two halves of the clamp. It would be even better if "ClicknGo" included bolts that were 1/4" longer so you wouldn't have to strain to pull the halves together. 
I purchased this for my Aria Twin stroller, but I ended up using it on my triple jogging stroller. It works like a dream, but it just didn't fit the oblong tubing on the Aria. Bummer 
I bought this for my Chicco London stroller and it works like a charm. Had to play around with the perfect location for the connectors -for Mommy's cupholder (or water bottle holder) and for baby's snack holder - but once I had it attached, we both couldn't be happier! I wish that they sold the snack holder separately - I keep forgetting to take it off, and after 2 years, it is showing signs of stress at the clip. Won't be long before it snaps, but it really gets bounced around in the back of the minivan, so I think it has held up great. Anything to keep my tot happy 
Bought this set in black for our Maclaren Ryder stroller and have had great success. You do need to test the positions before you tighten the clamps to make sure they won't interfere with closing of the stroller. We placed one clamp on the side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or the snack tray depending which we had attached at the time, and the other clamp on one of the stroller handles so we could attach the cup holder or water bottle holder for our use. We spent a few days at Disney World and had no problems with the attachments falling off or knocking into things. You do need to remember to remove and store the attachments before folding the stroller so they don't get knocked off and lost. We haven't used the S-hooks yet, they do feel and look a little flimsy, but they'd probably be okay for light bags 
This was a product that every mother should have it was definitely hard to part with when my daughter got older. It cleans not only avent but dr.Brown bottles too when placed correctly. It's definitely worth the money and its very efficient. 
My son is now 18 months old. I used this product from the time he was born until he was 10 months old and started using sippy cups. I don't know what I would have done without it. My husband was deployed and boiling bottles takes tons of time. My dishwasher has the sanitizing cycle, but when I used it the bottles and nipples would still have a film on them. The sterilizer kept them looking new. I also felt better knowing that they had been through the sterilizing process in the microwave. If you want to use your dishwasher, I would still recommend using this, it does not take much time at all. I used it on medula pump parts and gerber bottles, even the tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them in right. I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby, it was one of the few products that I actually used on a regular basis 
I have been a HUGE fan of this product since 1998. I love it so much that I have given several to my friends as shower gifts. Nine years later...I am now using my second sterilizer with my third child...It's a God-send! 
This sterilizer is wonderful! As a first time mother, I'm still figuring out things. But I realized this is one of those things I truly did need. It is so easy to use and does save a lot of time. I am not a germ freak, but I like to know that the bottles I am traveling with are clean and sterile. My baby is almost 6 months old and I have used it with Dr. Brown's bottles, Medela breast pump parts, and any other baby parts that would fit into it. 
It's so simple, makes your life so much easier!!! The lit will close if you turn it until you find the right position. Also, remember not to sterilize more than 4 bottles at the time. It just works perfectly. My baby is 8 months now and I've been using it since she was born. GREAT 
This cover is very soft....it is perfect for an infant's sensitive skin. We used our boppy quite a bit and still do to some extent. Even our older children loved how soft the cover felt 
I have twins, so I use my Boppys a lot. I have this slipcover in blue and pink. The fabric is really soft the texture prevents my babies from slipping off or out of the Boppy. The cover is easy to remove and put on and washes up great. The only real improvement I would like to see is to have a waterproof lining or something to protect the Boppy even more since it is a little difficult to wash. Overall, very satisfied!! 
We've been using this for 10 months on our alphabet print Boppy and it's still in great condition with just a few stains. yes, the alphabets show through but it doesn't bother me and certainly my son doesn't care. He loves the soft texture and so do I! 
This is a great cover because it is a pretty color as well as being soft and fuzzy. It washes very well 
My child was a puker. So this cover came in super handy. It made it easy to clean the boppy. It has a zipper and is easy on-easy off. I couldn't live without my boppy pillow, so this cover was a must have 
I have one on Cyneys Stroller and one on her car seat.. She looks very comfortable and that makes me happy. 
Love this product, my daughters head did not flop aroung at all. It kept her snug in her car seat 
My son was premature and was on an Apnea/Heart monitor for the first six months. We recently had a string of good downloads so his cardiologist decided to take him off the monitor. I didn't sleep for a week just lying there watching him breath (still worried), until I saw this product and ordered it right away. I've had it for about a month now and have slept much better and I know he does too since I'm not putting my hand on his back every five minutes. The problem I have with the product- The other night my son was crying and I picked him up, forgetting to turn the monitor off and it kept sensing movement (ticking). It never alarmed! My husband and I must have watched and waited for 10 minutes. NO ALARM! Now I'm wondering if it would alarm at all. I hope it's something I'm doing wrong and can figure it out. Too many good reviews not to be a good device. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I just wish I knew why it didn't alarm 
I worried constantly and woke up dozens of times each night to check on my son. Since I purchased this, I sleep much better. It is a great product. I did not purchase the thing to put it on...I just placed my on a large children's book 
I have a child that preferred to sleep on her belly due to reflux and I was so worried about SIDS. I bought this monitor and was able to rest a little easier when I put her to bed in her crib on her belly. I only had one false alarm and that is when she wedged herself into a corner and I guess the sensor did not pick up her movement. Better safe than sorry. Great purchase...highly recommended. 
Hi, we live in the Middle East purchased this product from Amazon for our new baby. Overall this product is fantastic. The motion sensor is just amazing lets my wife sleep so much better at night. There are minor issues with 'static' on the parent unit - the reception however is very good over long distance (from even outside the house !), but there is a little hissing noise/disturbance. EXCELLENT Product indeed !!! Suggest all new parents should get this gadget. Cheers. 
This is a wonderful product. I am a first time mom, neurotic, I know. But there is such a difference in my peace of mind with this monitor. I highly recommend it. We have had three false alarms, and only because our daughter is a very active sleeper and jammed herself into the corner of the crib, and out of range. Even then, it is worth it. I'd rather know if she has her face buried in the crib bumper so I can slide her out to the middle. It's great, I can't say that enough. I'm so glad I am having kids now when there are products like these available 
I bought this chair for my cat and she loves sitting on it. It is a purrfect size for her. She is a big fan of Hello Kitty. 
My daughter loved this chair once we opened the box. The seat's back has a nice and soft fur like material. The seat is about 15 inches wide so it will fit her til she gets married unless she is overweight! The only down side is the stability. It seems like the chair can fall back if it rocks a little harder. It's good that the rocking part is screw on so I may consider taking them out. Other than that, the seat serves it's purpose. 
I am very pleased with this purchase. I was a little concerned about the size, as I was ordering it for a 6 year old - but it is plenty big enough for her, the seat is very wide and could easily hold an even larger child. If you have a Hello Kitty fan, this is a great chair! 
I love this item. I have not had any trouble with it so far. My infant set fits right in. If the baby is sleeping and we have to go to a game, I can place the car seat right in the Cabana 
We got this instead of the Diaper Genie because we wanted something simple and easy to use-- no turning cranks-- and something that would still be usable after the baby's out of diapers. We love the Diaper Dekor! We bought 2 refill packs before my son was born. He's 13 months now, and I'm just now shopping for more. Another reviewer mentioned problems installing refills. We did have trouble the first time, but once we'd each done it once it was a breeze. Highly recommend this product, though right now it looks like Amazon is no longer stocking the refills. That means I have to go to an actual Babies R Us store, which I hate. So, if they no longer stock, that could be a serious strike against this product. (But they do still stock the Diaper Dekor +, so I'd get that instead. 
I purchased this to use as a hamper in our baby girls room. The bright colors and flower work great in her nursery. As a hamper it is okay. The top only unzips about halfway and so you need to use two hands to drop in the laundry. Also have to remember that it is collapsable and will fall over if anything is dropped on top of it 
Initially, I was going to get a toy box for my 10 month old daughter. Then I decided she needed the extra space in her room to crawl around and I didn't want to worry about another piece of furniture she would bang in to. I saw this product in the store and bought it. Not only is it cheaper than a toy box, its a space saver, its portable, and its light so you can carry it and its contents from room to room, you can put alot of things into it. The baby loves the colorful design and I love the fact she won't get hurt if she bumps into it. Also, it zips up on top so you can seal it. I recommend it. 
I purchased this stroller with the infant carrier two weeks away from my scheduled c-section. I was worried that it would be too big and bulky but by that point I was too exhausted to care. It turned out to be a wonderful buy. One of the best features are the rubber tires - they're noiseless and easy to push on any terrain. When I used the infant carrier it snapped in place super easy. I took this stroller to the beach at least 3 dozen times last year and it has weathered sun, sand and a wet toddler napping in it. The fabric dries easily. The cupholders and removeable snack tray are great. It folds easily. The storage basket is huge. It's also lightweight for it's comfortable size and extra features. 
I've owned this stroller for more than two years and have used it almost every day, typically strolling two miles per day, often with lots of groceries in the storage basket. My toddler also takes her naps in the Graco (won't nap anywhere else). One little piece just broke and it's not a safety issue but I'm taking the opportunity to shop for a smaller stroller. Reading reviews of other strollers, including pricey ones, made me appreciate the Graco even more. I do wish it was a little more narrow to maneuver through tight store aisles, and to take up less room in my house, but I have no other complaints. Here's a list of pros and cons... Pros: - Rides very, very well. Durable up and down curbs. - Large storage area accommodates up to three bags of groceries. - Toddler is comfortable and naps in stroller. - Reclines easily and folds pretty easily. - Two cup holders in back and one in front tray which clicks off on one side to remove child more easily. - Window in back to view child through shade. - Adjustable handle is good for tall people (I'm 5'10" and push it comfortably). - Works with Graco car seat for newborns Cons: - Quite wide. Sometimes hard to fit through aisles of small neighborhood stores and takes up a lot of space in home and car trunk. - Doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat. - Shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she is quite tall. Until about one year of age, I draped a light blanket over the shade when necessary. 
I was actually pretty impressed by this potty, and just happened across Amazon to see what the price was here (I had to buy it at a B, and wanted to double check to see if I overpaid). This was for Child #2. Child #1 had a potty, but was potty trained in the span of a week and never even sat on it (she used training seats instead). Child #2, well, not so good. After a few weeks of unsuccessful attempts at the training seat, I decided to get him a potty. Had I read the reviews here first, I never would have bought this one. Luckily, the B was my first stop and I ended up with two of these potties (one for home, one for grandma). Pros: Works as advertised Easy assembly and cleanup Decent battery life Inexpensive Cons: The musical fanfare that follows a successful 'drop' isn't foolproof, and will sometimes fail to activate. Deflection cup in the front is a little awkwardly placed, causing some collision (do I have to elaborate on that one? :) Summary: It's under twenty bucks, assembles in minutes, and doesn't eat batteries. OK, sometimes the music won't work - it's not exactly a high precision laser sensing toilet (if such an animal exists). It'll still work 90% of the time. I had bought the expensive potty for Child #1, and trust me - although it cost more than double the price of this unit, there were no appreciable differences between the two. It's easy to clean, inexpensive, and works as advertised. I wish more kids items managed to meet these simple requirements 
My 2-year-old refuses to go on anything else. Ours works fine. I need to find another one for upstairs. She runs to it and I've tried several other potties that I had to return. Highly recommend, but each child has their own opinion. This one is great for us 
I used this with my daughter. The only time it leaked was when it wasn't snapped in right. We never used the music (was thinking it wouldn't be beneficial and she'd want to put toys in it to make the music go). It was a lot easier to clean that our other potty chair. There's a little 'trick' (if you can call it that) to unsnap it before pulling it out instead of just pulling it all the way at once. Lightweight but sturdy. It has a back which feels more like a real potty. And she had no problems sitting on it. Obviously, we never used the pee guard (which is easily removable) 
A friend with a daughter recommended this highly, so we bought it three years ago for our son. It was a waste of money. He never used it, and went straight to the big john. Three years later, my daughter is delighted with her hand-me-down. I don't know what to tell you. Is it great or not? For a small price, it's worth trying 
Everything came in on time. It was in brand new condition! Thank you very much for your business 
I bought this play gym for our daughter when she was about 5 months old. She loves it, plays in it happily for long periods of time, and the little musical lion toy is actually musical (not at all annoying!) and plays several different catchy tunes. The toys can be moved around and swapped out with different, separate toys, and more links can be added to move things closer to her. We are very happy with this purchase, and so is she 
I bought Bright Stars Play Gym for my family childcare business. The baby loves to play with this gym. I love it because the parts are removable can be placed in different spots accomodating the baby's movements. It is also very easy to clean 
We are still in the midst of potty training but this by far has the best design. I have a little boy who is tall for his age and the potty chairs frustrate him and he is scared of the splash guards. This "topper" with the contoured design for a splash guard is the best I've seen yet 
My son is 3 and a half and we started potty training two months before he turned 3. We had purchased the cheaper seats at Target and Walmart, but he would still have #2 accidents. Our toilet is very elongated and all the other seats didn't fit well and were very wobbly. We just recently bought the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer and now he is excited about going #2.... It is very secure because of the adjusting dial and he can get on the potty all by himself. No more accidents after a week with this seat! The high front prevents #1 spillage and the contor shape holds him well. I wish that I had known about this seat 8 months ago. I very highly reccomend this seat 
Since I consider this expensive I gave it 4 stars...(I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating, it is better than 4 stars) Besides the expense, I'm quite happy with this product. There is nothing else on the market like it...so, we went ahead purchased it. This is an adjustable child's toilet seat that fits onto a regular toilet. Because toilets come in different sizes/etc. there is a dial(near the handle) which you turn to make the trainer seat fit snug on the toilet. I have found it is easy to place on the toilet plus it is so easy to remove. Some other brands of child's toilet seats are very difficult to remove. The BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer also has an oval shape opening...child's head won't fit through it. A child might try to wear it as a "hat" but it will not go down over their head around the neck. Neither our son or daughter have had any problems using this seat/trainer. It is easy for them to place on the toilet and remove. Our children do look so much more "comfortable" sitting on this Toilet Trainer seat instead of sitting/falling into the toilet when using a regular/adult size toilet seat. Before purchasing this I also checked out the Toilet Trainer at the BabyBjorn website. I was impressed with the information there. I recommend people consider purchasing the Toilet Trainer. 
My Son Is a big guy, 80% in everything. I Love that this hold him up high so he can see and it allows me to be hands free.. IT has a bilt in diper bag, so I don't have to cary alot of stuff.. It is great for use where a stroller isn't allowed or it is hard to use.. Only draw back... It takes 2 people to put it on. :( But I Still Love i 
My 11 month old son and my husband and I love this backpack. I originally just started out using the baby bjorn and loved that until he hit about 5 months and started gaining weight..then it killed my shoulders. This backpack is great...comfortable..a lot of the weight is on your hips. Highly recommended! 
I use my cross country carrier for shopping. I have twin boys so one sits in the cart and the other in the carrier. The boys weigh 20 lbs and I find it easy to carry them around in the cc carrier. The shoulder pads are very comfortable and its easy to take off and on with a baby in it. The boys love it and I do too 
I had the pleasure of "test driving" this carrier in the store with my son before we purchased and literally walked out with it. The kickstand is a great innovation that makes loading and securing kiddo very painless. The straps secure snugli and are very comfi. There is plenty of storage room for take-along essentials. The child seat is adjustable so this model will grow with your little one. Best of all my son LOVED the ride!! We walked all over the store as he laughed and cooed with glee. We plan to use this carrier in the rain forests of Costa Rica so it will get a true test of capability. Highly recommended 
I have to say I LOVE THIS BACKPACK. I am a mother of 3 and have used this for at least a year now and have NO complaints! Very comfortable, durable, safe and i LOVE the compartments. I use this product EVERYDAY to walk my eldest to school. NO wear or tear YET! Living in NYC I am not always up to a drive i like to take the subway into manhattan with the kids and walk around central park and there's no better way to do unless you you are sporting one of these. My son loves to go in it and tries to climb in himself before we head out. This is as good as it gets and for the price....well, ya can't beat it. Moms 
My 6 month old son enjoys this saucer a lot. I just wish it had more height adjustments - even the highest setting at 6 months and 27 inches tall seems not high enough - my son can put his whole foot on the ground - and the instructions say babies should only be able to reach the bottom with their toes. Overall though, great product 
This toy has given me the ability to set my child down long enough to get some things done around the house. He has a great time playing in it and gets excited as he masters each new skill. I recommend it to anyone who has a baby that needs constant stimulation 
This exersaucer has many great aspects. There are many toys for entertainment and if your child gets bored with the toys that came with the system, switch-a-roo's can be bought to mix things up. Our daughter has had this since she was 3 months old and at 5 months loves it even more. She loves the frog on the string because she can easily "mouth" it. There is learning and music on two of the three electronic toys and volume control on all. We use the arch solely for floor play at home and away from home because they are difficult to reach when attached to the exersaucer at an earlier age. Not sure how the toddler station will entertain yet; but as an infant, this toy is great. The cost can be expensive, but when you add up the variations, it is well worth the cost. The system does collapse but is still bulky and heavy to move around. The system can be a little time consuming to assemble but aren't our little ones worth it?! At the same time we bought a stationary bouncer because our daughter loved to bounce when we held her. However, we found that she stays entertained with this exersaucer for longer and seems to enjoy it better as of now. I highly recommend this product for a child to learn to entertain themselves (which builds imagination and better attention spans... and gives mom/dad a moment to clean a bottle or two) and is a great tool to interact with your child as you sit on the floor (eye contact and communication reinforces learning with the toys) 
I gave this exersaucer 5 stars because it keeps my baby interested so that I can do housework. We took our 3 month old daughter to the store and tried out each one to see her reaction. At 5 months now, she is able to pull on everything on her own without any assistance from me. We think it is great for building strength in her legs. My froggie doesn't croak like the other user mentioned, but everything else is the same. I am very pleased with our purchase, which is good considering it was the most expensive one 
My son, he is in the picture above, received this as a Christmas gift from his aunt, picked out by me because it just has everything you need on a toy like this. The music and the sounds are not annoying to parents, at least not to me and my five month old, Jacob loves it. He is content in there for at least an hour, which gives me sometime to get some things done. He laughs when the frog croaks and when the bee buzzes and he actually hums when the music plays. It has learning mode on the raised toy bar or music mode which is great for younger babies like mine. I highly reccommend this item. Even though my son is to big for the playmat part I still use the mat to put on the floor when he is playing 
My daughter absolutely LOVED playing in this. She would jump in it until she was completely worn out. She would laugh and squeal the entire time she was in it. I would just sit and laugh at how excited she was when she was jumping around like a monkey in it. She couldn't get enough of jumping in the Johnny Jump up and was upset when she finally outgrew it(We finally had to invest in a large trampoline and net). 
My daughter is 6 months old and has been standing since she was 4 months old. The evenflo classic Johnny Jump up is her favorite thing to play in. It has strenghtened her legs which has really helped her learning to crawl. The jump up allows her to be more independent and she can use it in any doorway with crown molding. This allows her to hang out and watch mommy in every room. The jump up is easy to assemble and is very strong as well as safe. It is made of washable material and easy to put up take down or pack for traveling. I have one at home and one at grandma's house. It is also very affordable. I would give it **** 
The jonny jumper is a great way to have the my child grow and it also allows me more time to do other things 
I am completly satisfied with the Evenflo Johnny Jump Up. I bought this to keep at my house when my granddaughter is visiting here. She has one at her house and loved it so much I had to buy one. She gets very excited while jumping and I believe it is good exercise and she has fun while in it.I had one for my kids when they were babies.The Johnny Jump Up can be adjusted according to height, so as to allow free jumping. It is easy to put up and take down and can be put in any doorway so she can be easily seen and she sees us.I am confident that this is a safe product and would recommend it to anyone. 
The clamp that hangs from the door frame is very secure, and the strap is adjustable for the baby's height. It's rather hard to get the baby into it, however. It's also rather large and bulky and my baby gets his hands stuck in the leg holes. I wish it didn't have the metal frame and fit more snugly around his body so he felt more free to jump around. This problem will probably not be such an issue when he gets bigger, though. Overall, it's a good product 
Our seven month old daughter does not like being on her tummy so she does not like to crawl or attempt to crawl. She loves kicking and we got the Johnny Jump Up Bug to help her use her legs more without having to be laying down on her tummy. She loves it. She now loves sitting up and kicking her legs and making herself move around. Since Johnny Jump Up Bug does not have a tray it is easy to get her in and out and she has not come close to pinching her fingers like the reviews for jumpers that have trays usually state. We are very pleased with the quality for it's low price and will use it for our future kids 
I got this for my sister and her new born boy. Like any new mother she was afraid to leave the baby alone for even a minute. For her to be able to leave the room and go to the bathroom or get something to drink or get the mail and still keep watch on the baby - that is such a mental relief. For her and her husband. The picture is very good quality. She has had no problems with interference from other devices on the same frequency in the area. 
We have the black and white large monitor also and the picture quality from the black and white camera is much clearer than the color camera. Color samera picture looks like there is some oil on the lens or something - not necessarily grainy, just smudged looking. I have returned it for a new one to see if the color one I had was defective. I didn't see why the picture quality would differ. We'll see! Also, you never get much color so don't' buy it for that. We didn't care about the color as much as the size/portability of the monitor. Also, you can easily plug it into the TV if you want the picture on the TV instead of the monitor. Very cool idea. But overall we love these monitors. The black and white one is crystal clear, excellent sound, and good reception too. You do have to move the monitor around sometimes if something else interferes with it but this has been a very minor problem in our house. Also, if you walk in the monitor and camera path it sometimes gets static. Again, rarely a problem. And ours sits right near our phones, computers, etc. We have two monitors and can switch the A and B channels to see each of the kids rooms which is so convenient. Definitely a "can't live without it" item for our family. Although the regular black and white one is good enough if you don't care about portability/counter space. Also, we have had a great experience with Summer Infant customer service. After having the black and white monitor for a long time we noticed a low pitched hum and they sent us a replacement very quickly, no problem. 
My 9 month old daughter has never been much of a sleeper. She wakes very easily and is very active the moment she wakes up. With the bedrooms on the second floor I am now able to watch her from our first floor using this monitor and know she is safe. This monitor has also been wonderful when traveling to see relatives. I am now able to relax and enjoy our visits with the ability to watch our little darling sleep soundly. The image is clear if the camera is within 4 or 5 feet and even when we have placed the camera 10 feet or more away, it is grainy but we can still see her tiny little body enough to know she is safe. The wireless video with night vision definitely met and surpassed my expectations. The other plus to this unit is that you can buy an additional camera and switch between the two cameras using the two channels available on the handheld monitor. I definitely plan on doing this when we have our second child. The only annoyance I have experienced with this monitor, compared to my regular sony audio monitor, is that I get more interference with this one. Overall I would recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for a video monitor. I was nervous spending this much money without first seeing the quality of the picture, but I am pleased to say it has been worth every penny. Our friends and family are always so amazed by this when we show it to them. My husband and I just love being able to see our precious girl at any time and know she is safe. 
I bought this monitor over two years ago, and still love it! Especially now that my son is out of the crib. I make sure he is not being mischievous at night without him knowing. I also enjoy plugging this into the television and recording the times when he is being mishievous, or just plain cute 
We have found this monitor to be very reliable. Just plugged it in and it works. I can't believe how well it works in low light/no light situations. We have a vacation home, and bought a second one so we don't have to bring it back and forth. No complaints 
Works well for us with good reception throughout 2 story 3200 sq ft house. A bit of static for a few seconds once in a while, probably depending on position of receiver. It does have a background hiss which is not hard to sleep with. Have 802.11 Pre-N router and 5.8 Ghz cordless phones also which do not seem to interfere 
I had actually registered for this warmer, then I had read the reviews, so I decided to take it off of the registry because they were not so good. I still recieved this as a gift anyway and thought that I would return it. My husband had taken it out of the box already and had set it up so I decided we would try it. I actually like this warmer alot. I have had no problem with my wipes being cooked. I make sure there is enough water in the resevoir, which by the way doesn't have to be filled that often and the wipes are nice and warm for baby. I also lik the little light on the front of the warmer. 
We've tried just about every diaper cover out there as well as every AIO and we keep coming back to the Bummis super whisper. Our daughter is thin and tall and the velcro means we're able to get the diaper tightened to fit perfectly. Well worth the money 
This is the first cover I've tried and it's great. I don't plan on trying others. It leaked the first time I used it because I hadn't adjusted it properly but since I check the fit, no leaks!! I use cloth while at home to cut down on costs. I don't recommend them for overnight...but if you want something affordable for during the day this is a winner 
I looked at all the reviews before choosing this warmer, and I am very pleased with it. 
I really love this wipes warmer! My baby used to cry when we changed his diaper at night but now that we use the warm wipes he hardly notices it and he does not fully wake up. I will definetly recommend it to other friends. The only drawback is that I could not buy it in Mexico so I had to ask a friend for it 
until we moved and this was packed for four months. We didn't think our daughter would be able to stand a cold wipe, so we rushed out and purchased this right after she was born. It was used religiously up to the point of moving. For the last four months she has had nothing but room temperature wipes and hasn't complained at all! ;) Yes, it's wonderful to wipe her little bottom with a warm wipe, but this isn't a MUCH NEEDED product 
This warmer is fantastic. The light is really useful especially in the middle of the night for changes. I didn't know about adding the 1/2 cup of water and have only had a problem with drying out when I didn't use wipes that had a slit at the top 
I especially love this warmer for the middle of the night changes. Cold wipes are shocking to the baby's skin and cause a lot of upset. These warm wipes are soothing and not shocking. Follow the instructions and add 1/2 cup of water over the wipes each time you fill the warmer. This keeps the wipes from drying out. The nightlight does not show much light, but does the job 
I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers! If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great! The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models. This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense! I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future. Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light. When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones. I am glad to have this "luxury" for my baby. I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM. It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort. I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway? I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions. I just add water whenever I add wipes; it's a no-brainer! If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions. I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth 
We returned the Lionheart warmer and got this instead. This one works MUCH better. It actually keeps the wipes warm and is easy to use. The light can be handy although we dont use it much. Its also easy to see if you are running low on the wipes rather than get suprised when you pull out the last one. If you need a wipe warmer, this is the one to buy. 
I got one of these for my grandson at Christmas, and my daughter asked me to locate another for the second car, he loves it so. She angled the mirror so he can see himself, and the fish jiggle around even if he can't kick it yet. She said he never stops talking to it the whole time he is in the car. Sounds like a "gotta have it" 
I received this play gym as a shower gift prior to my childs birth. I also received a larger more elaborate play gym at the same time. Because this gym is smaller and more portable I started placing my munchkin in it at 3 weeks to stimulate and entertain her. The bold black and white designs and primary colors are perfect for a newborn to attempt to focus on and there aren't a ton of hanging toys to overstimulate or startle her. It folds up easily for carrying around the house or packing in the car for a trip to Grammie's. You can even throw in a few extra toys when folded (it's like a large purse or carrying bag) and know that they won't fall out on the way. Now that baby is close to 2 months old and more playful the hanging toys are just the right height for her to bat at and she loves to gaze at herself and coo into the mirror. Overall I'm pleased with the gym and would reccomend it. I only gave it 4 stars because at times the overhead bar will tilt this way or that and you have to straighten it a bit to keep it upright 
We picked this swing over others because it's bright and colorful and because of the sound and speed options. We don't find the motor to be noisy at all... in fact the white noise is rather calming for the baby. It has taken my son a month or two to get used to it. I think he just noticed the moblie a week ago (he's 2 months) I think as he gets older and can play with the front tray he'll like it much more. Good points: *Familiar songs (to other Baby Einstein products) *Speed settings really are different. *Seat reclines quite a bit, very comfortable *front tray has many options such as speech, sound and songs as well as rotation. *parent friendly and easy to assemble *not "graco green" rather cheerful looking. *removable tray toy is great for "tummy time" or carseat toy. *cheery, stimulating moblie. *noise is adjustable. *good restraint. baby is secure. Flaws: *the mobile is too high up for newborns. My son didn't notice it until recently, each time i tried to point it out, he just looked at me instead. *the plastic tray sticks so tightly that it takes a real hard pull to open it. It always gives the baby a jolt. *songs on the front tray are too short I keep having to go up and press it to keep him interested. *the nature sounds sound more like static than anything else, great idea, just needs to be clearer. If you don't mind the minor flaws its a great swing for a good price compared to others 
We purchased this in desparation because our son has a lot of colic outbursts and we hoped previous reports were correct. Although it doesn't always work to calm him, it helps 2 out of 5 times which is better than before, and he even falls asleep in it occasionally - something he only previously did in our arms. So we have had it for 2 months and as long as i put on some of the white noise, in his non-fussy modes, he generally will go to sleep for about 1/2 hour! There are 2 things i would change - 1. the straps are a pain to work, and with a newborn they aren't really necessary since he doesn't yet move much. i always put a blanket on the fully reclined seat to soften the feel of the straps on his back (i don't use them yet). 2. The white pastic bar is a pain to use, it takes a lot to snap it down and unhook it when he is crying, so i just took it off (which took some work after installing it). now i can grab him easily when he wakes up fussy. all in all i am very please with it - he loves looking at the hanging animals over his head and the sounds work magic. 
We discovered that my son liked the swing when he would fall asleep at the gym nursery in thier swings. I chose this one because we already had the Baby Einstein Pack-N-Play and for the timer feature which works perfectly by the way. My 9 week old son goes right to sleep . Simply Wonderful 
I bought this based on the great review given by the previous poster about her colicky baby. Thankfully she was NOT wrong! I have a 5 week old who has been fussy and high need from the moment he was born. During the day he would only takes nap on me in a carrier and at night he would only fall asleep in bed with me and my husband. My arms and body were getting tired from carrying him all day. He would never sit in his bouncy seat for more then 5 minutes so I was hesitant to purchase another piece of baby equipment thinking it would not help. As I type this he is taking his TWO HOUR nap all by himself! I put on the nature sound, which is white noise, set the swing on the highest level and WOW, I was able to take a shower today for the FIRST time since he's born without someone holding him. I never wanted a swing, but now I am a FIRM believer in the power of motion for an infant! 
I am a first time mom with a 6 week old colicy baby who is usually up and fussy from around 10pm to 2am. My sister gave us an old Graco swing saying it would be an absolute lifesaver. My daughter ended up hating it. I hated it too because it didn't recline enough to support her neck, plus it wasn't very sturdy. So I took her to Babies R Us, where you can try the different swings out. Luckily she was very fussy at the time, even in my arms. She kinda liked the Nature's Touch swing but it was 40$ more and took 4 d batteries for 100 hours of continuous use. Then I saw almost all of them took 4 d batteries for 100 hours. Then I put her in the Baby Einstein swing and I am not kidding, she got quiet and happy. She loved the sound effects and the flashing lights on the tray. It also had a harness seat belt and reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around. I also noticed that It took only 3 d batteries for 200 hours of continuous use! There was another family shopping for baby swings at the time and when they saw how happy she got in the swing they decided to buy it too. That night she honestly slept from around 10pm to 2am. I actually got nervous because she was sleeping so long and woke her up! Oh, I also love how sturdy it is and that it easily folds down to store away or move around. It is the best swing Babies R Us has. Or at least my baby thinks so 
im glad i opted for this item rather than the expensive ones, it works well for all bottles sizes... for those who want to get the job done, yet not spend too much money...this is it 
Great product, especially when you need a sterilized bottle in a hurry 
This was a gift and not for myself. I understand the receiver really likes it. Thanks 
I bought this sterilizer not knowing what to expect and I was suprised. It works very well and is quick and easy. With a young newborn that is very important. It holds 4 bottles and the accessories. It only takes 4 mintues in the microwave, 2 minutes to cool, and it's done. Couldn't be easier. I would not waste $$ on more expensive sterilizers when this will do the job. 
I bought this for my not-yet-4-month-old daughter and it arrived yesterday. I put it together with ease (except being short one battery that I stole from a clock in the house). She has been holding her head up since birth and doesn't like laying down anymore. She loved sitting in this and looking at the toys. She's just now realizing her hands are hers to use so the toys on this are perfect. Her toes barely touch the floor and so she can't quite jump in it. But at her rate of growth, she will be jumping in a few days! Another reviewer mentioned placing a pillow under the baby's feet and I think I'll try that tonight. With that said, I still wish I bought this sooner. If you are thinking about buying it, don't wait until your baby is older. Buy it sooner and get your monies worth. Even if the baby can't reach the floor, there is great value in the toys. So far, so good. Although she is deeply interested in this new toy and trying to figure out what to do in it, I just LOVE it! I can see many hours of her enjoyment, mine watching her and valuable hands free time for me! 
We were originally going to get our 8 month old a jumper that you hang from the door. After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames, we firmly decided against that and researched floor models. We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base. The square Jumperoo didn't have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space. We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money. The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun! When we first put her in, she wasn't quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them. After she realized (in the first 2 minutes) that she could jump, she did with great joy. Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically. The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang. The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless, as does the color wheel. The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys. Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it. The box does not include the batteries and you'll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover. Also, the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you don't dry right away, well, they'll start to wrinkle. The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying/stowing but it's not a smooth transition. I don't see us doing it that often however. As I mentioned, the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially. And now, our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs. She doesn't seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older. Don't wait to get this, you won't regret it! 
I bought this after reading other Amazon reviews. I LOVE this Jumperoo. I put my daughter in this when she was almost four months old (she has great neck control). Although she couldn't reach the floor (pillow worked great underneath her) she immediately started to play with the toys and turn around in the seat. Few days later she was a jumping fool. She smiles and laughs in this thing. Watch out for really messy diapers, poop jumps right up the back and front 
When I first bought this for my son he was around 4-5 months old. I was disappointed at first because he did not like it. He would sceam when I put him in it. I thought, wasted money. Every week I started to put him in it more, and he finally figured out around 6 months how to jump in it. Now it's his favorite activity. He jumps himself silly, and loves to play with all the toys. He spends most of the time trying to get the parrot on top. Highly recommend. Just give them time to adjust and be big enough to use it. 
Our 8 month old daughter LOVES this jumperoo - she literally bounces until she's exhausted. She even tries jumping when she's NOT in the jumperoo anymore. Another A+ product from Fisher Price 
I have large breasts - DD normally without the added bonus of the milk. My son latched on great at first, but then got a cold and could not latch properly. He got lazy with my milk supply being very good and refused to open his mouth wide enough. Needless to say breastfeeding became torture. I was almost to the point of considering formula when I came across these. Within just a few hours of wearing them, the pain decreased. The shells helped shape my nipples a little better and made it easier for my son to latch with little effort. After a full day of use, the pain has become almost non-existant. I wish I had bought these for my daughter because I might have been able to breastfeed her longer than just 9 months. These shells have made breastfeeding the wondeful bonding experience it was meant to be. My son is still a little lazy with the latch, but he is getting better and opening his mouth wider now. At first I was discouraged by the thought of needing to sanitize them every night, but I bought a microwave bottle sanitizer which makes sanitizing them a breeze. I am a very satisfied customer 
I really like all the product from Haba, especially this mobile. They are made in Germany of high quality materials, and have a sweetness and charm that a lot of US products lack. I love the colors too. The only thing about this mobile that was a little unexpected was that it doesn't come with an arm to hang from the edge of the crib. Instead, we hung it from the ceiling on some elastic. Worked great 
We actually had to buy a couple extra bases for each of our cars and the sitters too. 
This is pretty much a must-have for infant seats, I don't know why they don't just sell them together. Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt, then just pop the car seat/carrier in and out with a simple little latch. It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze. Definitely get this 
We bought this base so that our daughter and son-in-law would not have to bring their base on the plane when traveling to visit us with our little grandson. Works perfectly with their Graco Snug rider infant seat 
When my parents bought the base off our registry, they didn't understand why we'd need two bases for one car seat. "Can't you just move yours between cars? It's not like you'll be riding in our car that often" After we strapped the second base into their car, they hardly ever removed it and they relished the opportunities to pick up the baby on the spur of the moment. They were disappointed when the baby outgrew his Snugride seat and hoped I could find a similar base system for the next size of car seat. After watching me move his convertible seat back and forth a few times, they've decided to install a second larger seat in their car to avoid the hassle. The Snugrider was a far more cost space-effective solution than 2 car seats, and since the base only has to be installed once, people less familiar with the car seat can still safely move the baby in and out of the car repeatedly with greatly lessened risk of error 
I loved my Diaper Genie. I used it for 2 years without a problem. My teenage daughter even figured it out. It kept the smell contained pretty well. We would empty it about every 5 days and never had a problem. Well worth the investment 
I have to disagree about the Genie being the best. It's close, but I like the NEAT better. I've owned several of these things (the Dekor, Champ, Genie and NEAT...why so many? All had issues...read on). Frankly, the Dekor and the Champ both smelled (and "smell control" is the reason I want one of these), so those two now serve as garbage pails in other areas of our home. The Genie is good at controlling odor, but the top is a pain to use, and the top on my Genie broke after about 2 months, so another one bites the dust. As for controlling odor, Genie and NEAT are both the best (they both seal off the bad stuff with different "sealing-off" mechanisms that the other models just don't have). And features other reviewers have commented that they like about the Genie are also in the NEAT system: -put a dirty diaper into a clean bag every time -plunge the top to contain the smell and section off the mess - change the bag every few days to a week. (Our 16-month old is in daycare M-F, so we only change our two NEATs once a week. And never a smell. Ever. -easy to replace the liners. Takes 30 seconds. (No smell when changing it, either). Plus... -the handle/plunger on the NEAT is easier to use one-handed than the Genie. Just push and pull. No grappling to get the top off or the bag to grab the diaper and start twisting (with a dirty diaper in one hand and a squirmy baby at the other). -less plastic is wasted because it pushes straight down. The Genie rotates plastic on plastic which sends more down the chute. As you can see, I've dumped a ton of money into this wisdom. But now, I finally have a stink-free environment in my son's room, and so far, nothing on the NEAT has broken (I'm only afraid that because it's an underdog, they're going to discontinue it, and then the refills will be hard to find). - If that happens, I would try another Genie and hope the lid holds out. I rank the Genie #2 out of all of these models 
Any diaper system will stink if you don't empty it. This one works great. If you are worried about the smell, you're probably not cleaning it out in a timely manner. Who wants to keep dirty diapers in their baby's room for two days? 
For us this is a LIFE SAVER!!... It has been really helpfull... I even bought another one for my mother's house... Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them, but I have to say something about how many times it gets full. It's not true that it gets full everyday.... or.... It would get full if you put the diapers open.... What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!! 
This night light is adorable. I just purchased this to add to my Froggy Tales collection. It lights the way to your little one's nursery. I love this line and am so glad they came out with more accessories. It has a simple on/off switch and seems durable. The only improvement I would make would be a sensor to turn off automatically during daylight hours. There is also a new wall light switch plate as part of the collection, in stores, not yet on line 
This is what I wanted for our leather seats. The carseat fits well and is very stable. The only thing that would make it better is if the back of the protector that fits behind the carseat were a little bit higher 
It doesn't exactly cover the top of the seat in our vehicle, so we have to use a towel over the top of the seat to protect it from dents. Otherwise it's great for our new car, which has leather seats 
We recently purchased our first new car ever! We wanted to make sure that our car seat does not put indentations into our new car's interior so we purchased this seat saver. It has been easy to use and so far it is saving our car's seat. Our daughter is in a rear-facing car seat and my my only complaint is that the bottom of the seat saver is much larger than the base of our car seat. However, I think that as our daughter grows, so will her car seat and this will eventually become a nice feature to have 
we have been using this seat saver for 16 months now and it has not ruined our leather seats. Every month I take out the (convertible) car seat and clean seat and re-install to do safety check and the seats are just fine. If your car seat is properly installed there is no way this seat saver will move around. My only suggestion to manufacture would be to make it a bit more narrow...it takes up more space on the actual vehicle seat than needed. The two-stage version is the only way to go 
With three kids under the age of four, these seatsavers have literally saved our leather seats in our new mini-van. I would highly recommend using these under all car seats 
Works very well and saves leather seats from impressions from the base of the carseat and the lip along the bottom piece catches most spilled snacks and drinks 
we bought this because my our car seat was making marks all over the seats in my car , it get the job done the only thing i wish was that it was a liitle taller or that it went up over the headres 
I purchased this seat saver to protect the leather seats in our new car from the car seat indents--it seems to be working great. 
When deciding which Froggy Tales items I would need, I wondered how useful this hamper would be. I thought it might be flimsy and not very practical. Being a new mom and never having ordered nursery stuff before, I didn't know that these hampers come with a separate lining that easily lifts out of its themed shell! I was happy I bought it. Not a must-have but definitely a 5-star functional accessory. 
I am a nurse so I am familiar with the sound of the human heartbeat. My husband and our two children ages 10 and 6 are FASINATED at the sound of our new addition's heartbeat! If I laugh, the baby's heartbeat will speed up and they think it is so COOL! We also hear other things like movement. The two headsets are a godsent! WE are really enjoying this product. I can also use it to spy on the kids when their door is closed!! 
There seems to be quite a few choices for Lamaze animal toys for babies (hippos, giraffes, turtles, etc.). I chose Larry the Lion and he is a big hit with my 3 1/2 month-old daughter. As she's grown, she's discovered new aspects of Larry which keep her fascinated. His bright colors are quite captivating, and his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle. She also quite enjoys playing with his "crinkly" mane, and now that she's teething, I think she really appreciates chewing on the 2 rings and the purple star that are attached to his paws. Larry is already our "stand-by", fail-safe toy when all other toys fail to pique her interest. A thumbs-up from first-time parents 
We call our seat the cushy tushie seat. This is a great over the big toilet seat. We've had it for 2 years it has not cracked or shown any signs of wear. It is easy to clean too. It is fairly portable to Gramma's house 
My daughter who is 20 months old LOVES this seat...I bought the royal toddler potty but decided to buy this one as well b/c its good to travel with...she refuses to sit on the royal potty..she rather use this one on the toilet seat. The only problem is we have an oversized toilet so its not a snug fit, but it does the job. 
I have bought many potty seats, tried them out and this has been the one I have stuck with. I even tried those "folding travel" seats, but all they do is slip and slide and scare my daughter into thinking that she is going to fall in. I even bought a second to take in the diaper bag. I HIGHLY suggest this as a potty training buy! 
This seat has worked brilliantly over the past few months. It seems very comfortable for my daughter who has used it since she was 6 months old. She is now 13 months old and just over 20 lbs and has no problems with it. I have an elongated toilet and it doesn't fit perfectly and my daughter is sometimes tempted to put her hands through the gap - especially to drop things in (!!) BUT this hasn't really bothered me much. We even travel with it as it is so ligh 
we bought this for our daughter, and it has been such a help with potty training. she can put it on the toliet herself and get up herslef, I am not worried about her falling into the toliet as I would be if she tried to get onto the toliet without this seat. and it is very comfy 
I have bought Freddie when my daughter was born. She has started to seem interested in it at about 3 months old, and really played with it after 4 months old. It's a pretty big toy for the hands of a baby that's why i think they enjoy it better when they have control over their hands and are able to grab properly. Highly recommended 
Simple and Elegant in Design. I've never met a BabyBjorn product that I didn't love. Easy to use, Easy to Clean, the kids gain confidence on the Real Potty and you're not wiping poop out of a "bucket". It's worth the extra costs, it's worth the shipping costs if you can't find it near you 
Very nice comfortable seat. The adjustment feature is great 
I love this toilet training seat! I like that it's a hard, molded plastic, and not a soft seat. It looks so much nicer in the bathroom and cleans better too. My 3 year old daughter finds it comfortable to sit on. The adjustment knob helps keep the seat in place. I also like the high splash guard in front...girls can have little fountains too, and this is the only seat we've used that keeps everything contained in the toilet. It was well worth the extra money 
I love this seat because it works on different types of toilets. It does not move around like some of them do. This is the third seat I tried, but just have not been as happy with the other brands. This one is great and worth paying a little more for. 
I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side 
Works well and no bells or whistles to distract the child from what they are doing. Easily portable to every bathroom in the house. Make sure you buy a step stool 
Great seat. It is adaptable to all toilets. There is an adjustable knob that cranks underneath to tighten it to the seat but you have to reach into the toilet to do it. I found that if you just get it close before you place it on the toilet it stays secure. You can either place it on top of the seat or lift the seat. It's easy on and off and your child can even do it him/herself. It worked so well I purchased three. 
Regular training seats you place on top of an adult size toilet just were not stable enough for my son. Add the fact that one of our toilets is oval and it was a BAD fit. Also add that he's a very big boy and regular seats would allow him to pee right over the little pee catcher (don't know the official term ;) for that part). He'd say, "Mommy - I fall" and didn't want to try. This seat works great because you can adjust it to make it fit with more stability 
this gate actually changed our life, our 18 month old was crazy about kitchen and we had to spent a lot of time being next to him so he would not hurt himself there. Nothing could keep him away from kitchen. After we bought this gate we can let him run around the house without being afraid that he would go there. This gate is very easy to install, to operate and it cost cheaper than others. I would recomend this to all with small kids 
We bought this for the door to our 2yr old daughters room once she transitioned to her toddler bed. It is nice and sturdy, seems to be very well made we love the taupe color. It is not wobbly at all. It took my husband 10-15 minutes out of the box to working. I love that we do not have to take it on and off to get through each time. The swing gate is easy for us adults to use but too difficult for my daughter to figure it out. I love it so much I am going back to purchase another one to use on the spare bedroom door!! Yes i did brush my toe against the bar once, now I know to step over it, not too difficult! Well worth the $34! 
Overall this is a good gate. I use it for a puppy, so it's a much more different experience for me than using it as a "baby gate". The intstalation was easy. At first I thought the gate was broken becuase the latch didn't meet and the upper end stuck out farther than the lower ends. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. I just want to make that clear. When you fasten it to the wall, the pressure pushes the top together so that it can latch. Use of the product was a litlle hard. The latch requires you to push in two buttons (pinch them between your index and thumb) pull it to the side (left or right depending on a few things) WHILE holding the buttons. And pushing it forward or towards you. It sounds hard. And at first is. But you'll get the hang of it. Using 2 hands if you can makes it easier. Quality of the product is great. It has withstood a lot. But keep in mind I have a 5 pund puppy not a 10+ pound child. One other thing I MUST note is that there is a bar along the bottom that touches the floor. It is VERY easy to trip over. And when you do, it hurts. Don't let this factor alone deter you from buying this gate. It's a good and relativly inexpensive product and one of the only decent pressure mount gates out there that I could find 
We swaddle our daughter every time she goes down to take a nap. When winter came around, we wanted something warmer to swaddle her in (because we don't use blankets with her) and we came across these. They are super easy to use and the microfleece makes them warm enough for our New England winters 
Although those hospital blankets are the absolute best for swaddling, these little suckers are the best if you're away from home and trying to wrap up a screaming infant on a couch at your mother-in-laws, on the grass at a picnic, etc. A nice tight wrap but cool enough for summer, although they are a little on the small size so you should just get a small and a medium. By the time they fit into large, swaddling isn't really needed 
We loved this product because we didn't have to remember the whole "burrito-wrap" system. The only down-side is that the fabric does stretch and our little houdini figured out a way out. But that was nothing that a few diaper pins wouldn't solve 
I never write reviews (but often read them), however this product is well worth the time (which is highly coveted these days with my 3 week old). This swaddle is very easy to use and actually stays put. I wish they had this when my four year old was an infant...I love it! 
if i could give this product 10 stars, i would. my son loves to be snuggled up in his swaddle me. he sleeps better and doesnt startle as easily. he has a hard time staying awake when he is in it, so if your baby doesnt stay awake for feedings, you may want to wait until after he is full to swaddle him. i wish i had purchased at least 2. i plan to buy another one, as well as 2 large sized ones. so far i have tried the small microfleece. my son was born 7 lbs and is still using the small one (and its rather large on him) 3 weeks later (not sure how much he weighs now, but 0-3 month sized clothes are still too big for him). in the future, any woman i ever buy a baby gift for is getting 1 or 2 of these from me. you cannot have a baby without one! make sure you get 2 or 3 because you will be miserable when your only swaddle me in the wash, or if you leave it somewhere, like i just did : 
My infant daughter loves to be held which is hard to do with her two year old brother wanting equal time. This sling has helped so much. And it's the same one that Dr. Bailey on Grey's Anatomy uses (except she wears hers upside down - don't know if that is intentional or not --hmmm... 
I was looking for a sling but didn't think that I could use the kind with the rings. I wanted something sturdy and when I was shopping online, I saw this one. I love this!! My daughter gets nice and snug inside and most people do not even know I am carrying her. Definately worth the purchase 
This toy bin is such a great investment. I'd give it 5 stars if it was just a tad bigger. It is not only functional as a toy box, but light and portable, has carry handles, collapses for storage and travel, and is an interactive toy in itself with its "mirrored" flower and bright, colorful, textured surface. My baby loves this and so do I. I have it in both designs - fish and flower 
I am very happy with this product, easy to use and help me have some peace of mind when my kid is playing around 
This simple product gave us the piece of mind to know that she was safe. My railing and bannisters were installed 6" apart and, if my daughter lost her footing (which we all know NEVER happens as a kid is learning to walk -- HA!), could have easily slipped between them entirely and ended up on the lower level. Pretty easy to install (I did it without my husband's help) and doesn't damage the railings 
Great deal for the price, pack of 2 seat protector. It just do what it claims, to protect the back of the front seat from little kid's shoes marks. Even if the description says "deluxe", it is not quite, the plastic edge (sewed lining) can easily tore apart if pulled too hard 
This is a great carrier. After lugging my 25 lb. boy around in the Playtex Hip Hammock this carrier feels like heaven. The Hip Hammock dug into my neck and was scratchy, gross, synthetic material. This is soft and cozy and distributes my guy's luscious girth so much more evenly. Yay 
I really like this carrier. It's beautiful and comfy, unfortunately my son (eight months) does not like it. He squirms and complains. I suppose you have to take temperment into consideration with a product like this 
My son is 6 months old and was becoming way to heavy for me to carry in the Bjorn anymore. My low back and shoulders we really starting aching. So I decided to see if their was something else out there and I found it! I was torn between the Playtex hip hammock and the Ellaroo. The playtex carrier had so much good feedback that I thought I would love too. I decided to get them both and give them a try. I took the hip hammock back immediately. The material was scratchy and uncomfortable. It felt so synthetic and looked cheap and ugly on. I wanted something I could wear out and still look stylish. When the Ellaroo arrived I was so happy! The fabric is soft and beautiful, it has a really natural feel to it. Now the real test will my son love it too. He did! The second day he actually feel asleep in it. I am able to carry him around for a long time with out feeling crippled afterwards. It is great for shopping as well. It folds up small and goes on in an instant. My son wont deal with sitting in his infant carrier while I grocery shop so I would always end up pushing the cart, holding him with that seat in the way, and minding my 3 year old at the same time. I know you moms can relate. Now he is content riding on my hip and things are a lot smoother for everyone! I highly recommend it! Just checking back in- my son is one year old now and I am still using the carrier on a daily basis. We both are comfy and happy. Now that he is walking it is great to keep him up when I don't want him crusing and touching everything like at the doctors office. If I was just holding him he would just squirm away and get down. The carrier has also gone through several washings and is holding up just fine. My husband jokes that one day my son will be wearing me in it! haha 
Got this stroller pretty quickly from the seller back in December. Very nice, and quite solid. Our daughter loves it. It's clearly an example of "you get what you pay for". My only complaint. I wish the basket underneath could be a little deeper. But overall, an excellent stroller 
I bought a 2006 BOB Revolution. I live in a very small town with dirt/gravel/and brick roads. It is so smooth, my baby doesn't even notice and neither do I. I love this thing so much. It folds up easier than my Chicco. 
This chair was sturdy and well made. It is ideal for grandchildren's visits as it can be easily set up and also stored in a small space 
This has been a great booster seat. We bought one 5 years ago and used it for both kids. It folds up nice and is durable and easy to clean. We used to take it camping with us and strap it to the picnic tables. Best booster seat we ever tried 
We originally purchased this chair 7 years ago, same design different colors then. After two more babies we thought to get a new portable chair for travel, the new ones come with so much more, or so I thought. I bought one with a removable tray thinking that would be nice and-no way. As soon as our daughter figured out that she could fling the tray off it was a waste of space and made a bigger mess!!!( Now she can throw all the food at once!) I miss our simple back-to-basics chair like this one. Also be careful most of the other chairs are not as height adjustable as this model. This is a great economical and reliable choice 
My daughter has been using this chair since she was 11 months old (she is 16 months now) and she loves it. She sits at the table with us and really enjoys the seat, which places her at our level. Also, it's really easy to clean and fold up nicely. Love this chair 
My one year old granddaughter loves these "jingly" instruments. We play music and dance and shake the instruments. During Christmas "Jingle Bells" was one of our favorite songs. These will be used for years to come! 
We really like these toys and we like to take them with us when we travel. My daughter also has the Drum/ Music Set by Parents Magazine which she actually likes better. But these are great to use and encourage musical skills with your children. They are easy to listen to and are very durable 
I bought this set for my baby when she was 6 month's old and they quickly became her favorite. She has a box full of small toys/rattles but she always ends up grabbing for one of these. I like how flat they are which makes it easy to tuck one into a small diaper bag so she can have musical entertainment when we're on the go. My baby is approaching 1 year and still is intrigued by them. I anticipate years of fun with this toy. A great purchase 
My little musicians give these instuments a good workout and they are still in great shape. They really enjoy them and love having their own instruments to play. I highly recommend them for a child who enjoys music 
I really like this stroller! It is super light, easy to manuver, folds up nicely, my girls love it..and the really love being next to each other! With my stadium stroller someone was either kicking the back or pulling hair..and fighting who is in back or front...the only thing I would say about it...it does just about make it through the door ways..it makes it but a tight squeeze. The canopy I can't figure out for the life of me ...but that is minor...cup holder is decent and at least it holds something. No storage bin but I hang everything from the handles...it's a good buy for the money and my kids love it and that is all that matters! 
As a mother with twins, this stoller is a great option as the kids get out of the infant stage. It folds up smaller than most double strollers and is light weight and fairly easy to control. Drawbacks: no real storage for diaper bag or purse and the seat belts are difficult to adjust quickly 
We have three children, ages 2 mos to 3 years, and we use this stroller with all three. The seats fold down flat enough that, with use of the seat belt and a head support, our infant does just fine in it. Our 2 year and 3 year old love it because they can sit side by side and talk, share snacks, etc. The only problem we have had with it is that, in 18 mos worth of serious wear and tear (i.e. a dozen plane trips, two vacations, and weekly use at the zoo), the clip that holds it together when folded has gotten warped and so sometimes pops off. The cure? We wrap a luggage strap around it when flying- the rest of the time it is no big deal. We actually have a double jogging stroller (which cost 3x as much) that, while we loved it for about 2 mos), we haven't used since our second child was 3 mos old. It is big and bulky, and it much more difficult to maneuver. The Jeep double umbrella stroller has been great 
I bought this for a friend who is expecting a second daughter, wanting the new baby to have something special too. Their first is about 20 months and I know she has sleeping issues, so anything to buy them extra sleep with #2 I thought would be appreciated! Well, here is the email we got from her husband yesterday: "[Baby #1] has gotten really attached to the sleep sheep you got for the baby-to-be. She has taken over ownership of it. [My wife] called me to tell me that [Baby #1] was freaking out, trying to find the sleep sheep, when she found it she hugged it and fell asleep. If this works, I will forever be indebted to you both... " So I'm adding it to our registry, expecting #1 of our own in September 
The Sheep is very large, but it does what it says--plays nature sounds. I only wish it had a time selection or remote. 
I bought this Sleep Sheep for my son who was 20-months at the time. He was transitioning into a big-boy bed. He loved the bed, but wanted me to stay with him until he fell asleep. I bought this sheep in hopes of another source of comfort for him, to replace me! It worked! He loves it. The only downside is there is only 2 sound settings he likes. The heartbeart and whale sounds are a little creepy. I would've liked to have a few more options like birds or a babbling brook. But we do love the rain and the ocean settings that are available. I say "we" because I find it very soothing too 
The name says it all, it is soothing for them. It plays for a long time after you turn it on. It's nice that you have many options to play besides the heartbeat sound. My son is 8 months old and we still use it 
Totally worth the money - not only is it cute but works wonderfully. Our baby loves the ocean surf sound... works like a charm - always soothes and puts her to sleep within minutes. Bonus - also works on the hubby 
Great set - not too babyish for my elegant guest room. Great for my grandson - he loved the sheep applique etc. and appropriate for my granddaughter too 
I have the Skip Hop Dash in black canvas and absolutely love it. So, this was just a little added bonus to get for the bag. It holds 2 size 2 Gerber Nuk pacifiers and with its snap strap can be attached to just about anything. We attach it to our stroller so we can have clean pacifiers on hand at all times 
Well, I can't give them too bad of a review since this is the only pacifier my son will take. However, I can't give it all five stars either... For one, this pacifier is really bulky compared to other pacifiers. It almost looks like the nipple you would put on a bottle...it's that bulky. Second, there is an attatcher that attatches to the pacifier and clips to the baby's cloths so the pacifier doesn't fall on the floor, and that is even more bulkier than the pacifier. So using the two of them your baby is almost consumed with this pacifier. I guess my biggest beef with this pacifier is more cosmitically. It's an ugly pacifier. Besides it being ugly, it's a pretty good pacifier. I like that my son didn't have a problem with nipple confusion due to using this. From the moment he was born he just had a high need to suck and I just couldn't spare my breast for the whole entire day, so we had to give him a pacifier. He never had a problem using this pacifier then nursing on me. 
Like the reviewer below, my baby also was sucking on her hands, her clothes...and did not like the Avent pacifiers I had bought for her. My friend told me to try a Soothie, and it worked wonders, immediately. Baby does not spit it out. It apparently is suitable for babies who breastfeed. I would have to agree that the con is the lack of a handle. There are 2 little holes in the pacifier that you could use to tie a makeshift pacifier clip string, otherwise you should get several in case it falls out and gets lost. Side note: it is very cute to watch your baby sucking on this...you can see his/her mouth working through the pacifie 
My twin daughter really needed a pacifier as she was chewing her clothing and this was the only one she would take and she loves it! The only con is that it has no handle 
My newborn son would not take a pacifier for the first three weeks of his life. We tried many different brands (Advent, Mam, etc.) but unlike his older sister who took to the Advent brand on her second day of her life, he did not like it at all. The shape of the pacifier seems more natural to the breastfeed baby. I would strongly recommend this pacifier to all mothers that are breastfeeding. We are so thankful that we found this pacifier, especially at 2 in the morning! 
Ever since our first child was born, I have had trouble breastfeeding. I produce a copious amount of milk and find it is extremely difficult to teach my tiny newborns to latch on properly. Therefore, I have relied heavily on this little electric Medela pump for all six of our newborns. I have read several reviewers say that the pump is sufficient only for occasional pumping sessions, but that has not been my experience. I actually stopped breastfeeding two of our newborns entirely until they were each about six weeks old and could latch on properly without damaging me. I used this pump to express milk seven to eight times a day for those six weeks and never had a problem. The motor kept on going strong until the last baby. Now, all that said, I will say that I am planning on purchasing a double pump for our seventh, due in ten weeks. I anticipate the same struggles with breastfeeding him that I have had with all the others and I would like to be able to pump both sides at once. Pumping then feeding baby from a bottle can consume my entire day, and pumping quickly will be a welcome help. 
I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom, but this is really handy for when we go out and can't schedule around his feeding times. I didn't have any problems with let down. It does make noise, but it's not noisy. I only pump at home so it doesn't bother me. I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever 
Everyone tries to tell you that any breastpump that is any less than a hospital grade will not work if you are going back to work full time. But I found that this one worked just fine, I could pump for 15 minutes twice a day, and it worked great. I ended up not breastfeeding for as long as I had thought, and I am very glad I didn't spend $200-$300 on a breastpump. This one still works great, and I plan to use it for my next child. Not everyone needs a hospital grade pump, don't let people convince you of that. I gave it a 4 because it was a little loud, but not too bad 
When I got this pump, it was because I was a single mother and my mom wanted to give me a night off once in a while. I chose this one because I orginally intended to only use it occasionally and I didn't have much money. Then I developed a Candida (yeast) infection in my nipples that simply would not go away. Nursing was too painful, but pumping was bearable, so in an effort to continue providing the milk nature helped me make I used this pump. Sure, the suction wasn't industrial-strength, and I had to do one breast at a time. However, the pump did the job in almost the same amount of time my son finished his bottles, and I was even able to pump a little extra for longer-term storage. I was able to use this pump with steady efficiency for two months straight...and my son never once had any formula. If you are planning on returning to work, I do not recommend you purchase this particular pump. Go ahead and get yourself the time-saving double pump. However, if you really are going to use this just occasionally, I would recommend this product 
I love this pump. I've been using it since my daughter was born (nine months ago). At first I used every other day but when I returned to work I had to use it twice a day. It works pretty good. I don't have any complaints about this wonderful pump. I'm now using it once a day and still working! I hope this review helps moms out there who are unsure of what kind of pump to buy 
I lived in Nicaragua Central America and the hand pumps here cost US$ 75.00 This one is a dual electric pump and was a relief for our new born baby 
The only reason I gave it a four is because I had one of the same model but a single and it worked bette 
I have had many stroller over the span of the last 7 years and 3 children and this is the best one yet. So easy to push and isn't so wide that you can't fit through the doorway but wide enough so the kids don't fight. My oldest even jumps on the front wheel cover (I know he shouldn't but what are you going to do) and I can comfortably push all three. love it. love it. love it. Get this stroller if you are looking for one 
I've been searching for a stroller that met all my needs and this is it. I have twins that are 10 months old and I have used 4 different strollers since they were born. None of them did everything I needed until now. I needed something for every day that could fit in my van and I could also take on the beach. This stroller fits in the small space (about 19" deep) in the back of my van without having to remove the wheeles. It opens and closes so quickly and easily. You just unfold it and it locks into place. Closing is just as easy with one hand. The seats recline separately, the front wheele swivle is wonderful. I can easily push this stroller with one hand. I have been able to get through all doors, but I will say that there have been a couple places that was a tight squeeze. There is a good basket under the stroller but there is a bar above it so you can't put anything too big. I love that it has seat cushions that you can remove and wash. It has a foot brake but no hand break so I'm not sure if this would be a good stroller for serious joggers. It's great to find something that will make my life a little easier 
I love this easy to push, light weight double stroller. I have no trouble putting it into my car and the best feature is the front wheel. It swivels and locks. So when I run, I can lock the front wheel and when we just take a nice walk, I unlock the wheel for easy mobility. My two boys love sitting in it and there is enough run so they do not complain. Well worth the money I paid for it. 
My husband and I recently purchased this stroller and I can't believe how smooth the ride is! We shopped around before we choose this one as our favorite. This stroller is so easy to maneuver around since it has the swivel front wheel, that's one of my favorite feature about it. Another feature I absolutely love is that the seats recline seperately and how easy it is to recline them. We have 2 kids (ages 1 &amp;amp; 2) and they don't have to turn around to look at eachother anymore. I have to say that anyone who has two little ones, this stroller is much easier to push than any other double stroller out there 
This is the best booster seat we've ever purchased. It sits firmly on any chair, it's very comfortable for my 3 year old and there are no clumsy straps to deal with. It's also very easy to take along wherever you go. We would recommend this product to anyone with toddlers who eat at the "big" table 
My kids love the cooshie booster. Its stays secure without straps and is nice and soft for their little fannies. The booster is easy to clean and is "stainless". I highly recommend the Cooshie Booster. We've had one for over 4 years now and bought our second when our second daughter was ready approximately 2 years ago. Both are still in perfect condition 
let me start by saying I have twins that are 2.5. I have never written a review before and I wanted to do so for this item. I was reluctant to purchase a Cooshie due to the cost and purchased the hard plastic ones from Wal-mart instead. The hard plastic ones were leaving small bruises on my girls' backs right along their spine from leaning back into the hard seat. They also will rub the finish off of the seats of your hard wood chairs without putting something under them. Also the hard plastic ones are hard to clean and difficult to remove from the seats to clean under them, because crumbs will get under it and in it and around it. The cooshie is light enough that my girls can carry it around them selves and they love to sit in them to watch TV. I love the ease of being able to move the seats without unstrapping them in case we need the extra adult space. Mine came with carry bags so we can take them with us to a restaurant and not have to use the germ infested seats there. Cooshie seats are well worth the money. I plan to use ours for several years to come. They are also a breeze to clean 
Our playgroup has lunch together every week. One of the moms bought this booster and brought it for her daughter. Within two weeks the entire group had bought the cooshie booster seat. They come in black, green and blue so far as I know. The clean easily and are very convenient to carry to restaraunts in the carry case it comes in. I am a tough critic of baby products and this one ranks #1! Grayson, GA 
We love it and most important our 2 yr old loves sitting in it. Soft and comfy. A must have!! 
My 4 year old son just didn't fit at our new kitchen table and chairs. We tried phone books, but they moved and ended up on the floor half the time. We pulled out his old hard plastic booster seat but he was just too big for it. I purchased the Cooshie Booster and it is perfect!!! He fits in it with lots of room (and he's a big kid), its not at all as small as the standard plastic booster seats and the super soft material really is great! Awesome product that I highly recommend for bigger kids, since it does not secure onto the chair or have a seat belt, I won't use it for my 20 month old daughter. 
I have a smaller five year old that wanted to sit in a big boy chair, not the stool we had been using. After he destroyed one of our phone books, and scratched our wood chairs with a hard plastic seat, I found the Cooshie. I highly recommend it. It is easy to cart with you and he loves having a seat that can move around. We are looking forward to using it next week at a movie theater. No more coats! Consider this seat if your child is smaller, but no longer a toddler. In addition, he loved the color and the softness. What a bonus 
I have two, one for each of my boys. This booster is great because it doesn't need to be straped or attached to the chair and is very portable. It never moves from the chair either and is so comfortable for the kids. We absolutely love them 
This is the prettiest car seat and the best fit for my baby! She loves it 
I received this carseat as a gift and loved the colors. I researched it online to find out that it is very safe in comparisson with others. However, baby seems to big in it. Even with the newborn headrest, my baby's head can dance in it she was 7.8lb. Overall, good carseat but if you have a small baby you will need additional head suppor 
I love the carseat, my baby is small and she is so cozy in it. This is my third child and I wish I had this carseat with the first. I can not tell you how many compliments I get on it when I go out too! It is so pretty 
Easy to use, lightweight. Clicks easily into the car bases and Graco stroller frames. I LOVE the pink. The strap system is secure and very easy to figure out, even for me! I suggest having a certified baby car seat installer put the seat in for you. My husband (an engineer) and I thought we installed the bases correctly and they still need some slight changes 
Overall I love this carseat but I found out today that I have been driving around with the handle in the wrong position. I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why. The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all. I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was "tested" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash. I think I am going to believe the police officer vs. the manufacturer! 
This is great at keeping my 1 yr old occupied during my big shopping days! I have tried other strollers. Go with the Limited! It has noises on the toys that keep him busy. Not to mention the inquiries I get from other parents! It is not hard for me to get it in my Yukon. Howver, I have to put it in the front seat in my husband's Maxima as it does not fold real flat. 
I purchased this stroller for walking around the neighborhood so the weight/size/fold was not an issue. The tires and suspension give a smooth ride and it is easy to steer. Negatives: seat padding could be thicker, recline mechanism is a cheap toggle, and I laughed when I read others' complaints about getting their finger caught in the harness but it happened to my husband and myself. For the price, it is a great value and and I would definitely recommend it 
Very easy to put together and it rides wonderful on our neighborhood trails. My daughter fits snugg in the seat unlike other strollers we tried. Folds up easily, however its a little awkard to pick up and load in the car. 
We originally wanted a stroller/car seat combo, but we received this as a shower gift. We love it! Our infant Graco Snug Ride carseat actually fits into the stroller (facing whomever is pushing). My husband loves the iPod connection, it works well as best I can tell. The tires are easy to inflate, I was able to figure out the air pump to inflate the tires with out any instructions. I also find that it has a lot of storage capacity for shopping. It is not super easy to steer with one hand as I sometimes have to do when my baby wants out. The stroller is heavy to lift in and out of the trunk and it does not fit in all cars. It can be awkward to lift and stowe ( watch your fingers )and it takes up a lot of space. It does collapse using one hand, but its not as if you could do it while holding your baby or anything else so it might as well be two handed) Also, I find that it is not the best a steering in small isles in stores, it tends to get hung up. However, it will ride over most terrain quietly and with little disturbance to your little one. It has two cup holders in near the handle, but I find that they are usually too small. I read once that they were designed to fit a Starbucks cup--My Avent bottles do not fit well nor do bottles of water. Overall, I would recommend this stroller, its well priced, durable and functional. 
I finally picked up the jogging stroller now that my boy is 17 months old. It was easy to put together and is very quiet. Since its brand new there hasn't been time for it to get squeeky! My only complaint was that it seemed to lean to the right until I walked with it for about a mile. Then it corrected itself and I think it is nice. The other thing was the left back tire rubbed one time on the break that sits up above when unlocked. But that could have been some uneven ground. I have the Sport model that doesn't come with the MP3 thing I think. I'll just listen to the birds and ambient sounds instead. 
ESTE BEBE YA TIENE SU PRIMER CARRO...SU NUEVO JEEP LIBERTY STROLLER....ES PERFECTO... 
This tent was a much needed item after my son 18m climbed out of his crib but then was not emotionally ready for his daybed yet. Since I needed it ASAP I could not wait for shipping so I called local stores. It wasn't at a few baby stores, which surprised me but I found it at Babies r US. I wanted the original one without side enclosures but could not find it. I guess there's a good reason they changed the design and I trust it was from wise consumers input. Anyway, setting up the tent part was a snap but affixing it to our crib was the challenge. We have a convertbable 4 in 1 crib that has a headboard higher than the drop rail side. This means the front and back vertical poles aren't even which causes a problem when trying to secure the super strong velcro fasteners.It would leave it crooked and possibly able to slide since the corners would not be resting stable as the must be. We found a way to level it, since I was not gonna give up. My hubby mounted an old broomstck behind the backboard even with the front and we got it level, well rested and snug on the crib perimeter.My complaint of taking time and effort is based on good safety so I say it for preparation not to disway your purchasing. The velcro hoops are so tough to pry open and then fasten it worked me out. Also, when inserting the mattress we found it much easier if two people do it so they can get it flat and then drop it into the net rather than trying to sinch down the sides. The enclosure is soo snug that it will make it hard to adjust if you drop one side down first. All that to say, my son loves it and was so eager to get back into his crib lastnight. I was a at peace knowing he wont fall trying to climb out again 
This is a wonderful product - we got it to keep the cats out of the crib. However, the zipper wakes up our son almost everytime we try to open or close it. So we usually just shut his bedroom door now. Maybe our next child won't be so sensitive to the sound. Update: now that he's a little older, he isn't waking up to it - as long as we very quietly zip it 
My son was one of those climbers so i had to buy this when he was 18 months. He was able to climb out but had a couple falls that made me nervous. We have had it for awhile now and i absolutely love it. I am also happy to have it for the next child so that i don't have to worry about my son throwing things into the crib. I recommend it to all parents. It is easy to assemble. I have one at my mom's house and home. At first my son was a little uneasy about it but i zipped it up while he was sleeping each night until he just got used to it. Now he asks me to do it. 
This product has been a lifesaver. My newly 2 year old had learned to jump out of his crib and is just not ready for a bed yet. I bought this and within 25 minutes it was completely put together and put on the crib. I did it myself and found it simple to do. I haven't had a problem since. The only downfall I have is that the zipper will wake him if I go in there and want to cover him with a blanket. I found changing the sheets easy-the mattress fit right thru the opening and I switched the sheets no problem. This product is excellent 
We were very pleased with this item. As others have mentioned, changing the sheets requires removing the entire tent, but I didn't mind doing this. Our son thought it was neat- just like camping inside. He did not even attempt to jump out of his crib after this was put on. It fit just fine on our sleigh crib 
My husband and I over-analyze everything and this highchair is the best that we've seen. We started our son on solids at 4 months, which was before he could sit up by himself, and has worked flawlessly ever since. The tray easily slides on an off, even one handed. The cover is easy to wipe down, the tray stores itself on the back of the chair, the harness straps are secure, and when it folds, it really is a "space-saver". The leg separator was annoying at first, but we found that it is detachable (the foot rest is as well). 
We've had this chair for about 6 months now and love it! Our older son had a Graco one but when we stored it we lost the straps, so we had to find a new chair for the baby. I was looking for an inexpensive chair but when I saw this one with all the features I loved it immediately and decided to splurg. So glad that I did! The chair is very easy to clean and folds up small enough to fit between my frig and wall. While the trays are too big for the dishwasher, they clean up really easily with a wet wipe so that doesn't bother me. 
This is THE perfect chair. We love it. My son is 6 months and he seems really confortable in it. I'm sure he'll be fine for the next few years. It's very convenient with all its different positions. I can feed him in the living room or at the kitchen table. He can be vertical to eat solids, a little less to drink his bottle and laying back if he falls asleep. It's very easy to clean as well, and easy to fold. It's just PERFECT. Nothing wrong about it. 
I recently purchased this 6 piece set, along with the lamp, hamper mobile, for our nursery. The colors are vibrant pastel pinstriped shades of blue, sage green, and tangerine with touches of bright yellow. I like that brand new from the package, the material is touchable and isn't stiff as a board. While this is generally listed as 'gender neutral' I think buyers should know there is a *lot* of blue in this set. While that doesn't matter to us, I know some parents prefer more yellows, greens, oranges, etc... for true gender neutrality. The embroidered details (Humpty Dumpty, Cow Jumping Over the Moon, etc..) on the quilt, bumper pad, diaper stacker and hamper are just beautiful. they stand out but are do not take away from the prettiness of the fabric. The accessories are cute but I think if I had paid full price for the hamper lamp that I would be less pleased. The material of the hamper is great, but the wooden structure is very flimsy. I foresee this getting put inside the closet once baby is crawling or it will easily be pulled over. The lamp has a story book with Hey Diddle Diddle (cow, spoon, dish) on it - very cute - but up close you notice it was not painted well. From a slight distance you don't notice it, but it does bug me a little considering the price. The mobile is cute, but I do not care for the fact that the baby will only see the bottoms of the stars, moon and cow. Not nearly as exciting as the ones that position the animals/shapes down towards the baby. Would not be my first choice for mobiles (I prefer the geometric symphony one), but since I got this as a package deal I will likely use it. Overall: *the material is nice quality touchably soft *the colors embroidery are beautiful *the colors do lean a bit more towards a traditional 'boy' room versus a neutral room with light blue as the main color for the bumper pad, the dust ruffle, the hamper and the valance *hamper, lamp mobile not as high quality products as the crib set I would recommend this crib set to friends family sans hamper, lamp mobile. The nursery rhyme theme is classic well put together here by Lambs Ivy. I rated this 5 stars simply for the crib set. For the price and the amount of items included it is a great deal. If I were rating the accessories I would not give them more than a 3 for just being average 
My granddaughters were delighted with the new Princess car seats, I feel good knowing they will remain in them and safe. The service was excellent they were received by them the next day. I had a very positive experience. Thank 
I seriously love this bowl and spoon. The bowl fits nicely in your hand so it's easy to feed a squirming baby. The spoon has a very soft tip so you don't have to worry about hurting their gums. My daughter is a year old and mostly feeds herself, but we are still using the bowl for snacks or I'll put yogurt in one side and fruit in the other. The lid always stays on and the bowl still looks new even though we've used them a lot. I would highly recommend this product 
The baskets are good sized to hold most infant feeding items including spoons, bottles, breast pump accessories and more. My only complaint is that the valve container is a little misleading. The openings are still too big for breast pump valves but nowhere in the information on the product does it clarify that it is actually designed for the larger sippy cup valves. 
I have the basket for my son's bottle parts and nipples and it works wonderfully. It holds the parts to 10 bottles and allows the dishwasher to get them all clean. I've never had any issues with this basket 
I have two of these dishwasher baskets, but I do not have the valve basket. They can be purchased separately at some stores. I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top, but it much more difficult to use. Everytime you opened it to add another nipple, the ones already in there would fall out. These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better. They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into. The best aspect, however, is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened 
My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore. I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time. Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter 
We have used this seat for our son since he was about 10 months old, in shopping carts and at restaurants. It is easy to install and fold up-it has pockets in the sides so he can keep his toys with him and keeps his hands clear from all the germs from carts and high chairs. Plus, he looks so much more comfortable in this seat cover! A must for new Moms concerned about germs and keeping baby healthy 
This gives 100% coverage - even covers all of the big costco cart. There are loops for holding toys and a little side pocket for extras. My son loves to ride in the cart and chew on things - with this I don't have to worry that he's going to chew on the cart. It's also extremely easy to put on and take off - I usually do it one handed while holding my son. A must have! 
This is an amazing product. I had seen other shopping cart covers in the stores but they all have little ties and velcro sides and look quite complicated. Who has time for all of that? With the Floppy seat you just stretch it over the cart, slide the seat belt through, buckle and go. It covers all of the surfaces of the cart, unlike some others. It's so nice and comfy, lots of cushion and I can attach a toy to the loops and put my baby's sun hat in the pocket. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I know it is more expensive than some of the covers that are in the stores but it is well worth the extra cost. This is one of the best baby products we have purchased 
I have used both Kissaluvs size 1 2 with my son, from age 6 months - 2 years. He has never leaked! I never had a problem with drying them - perhaps because I live in a dry climate. My husband loves them too, so they are all we used. Buy them new at about $10 each. I used 2 dozen at a time. My son is such a wiggle worm that I recently bought a few fuzzi bunz pocket diapers. I like them better for his age (2-3 years) because I don't have to wrestle a diaper AND a cover on him. However, they are pricey at $15 each. I'm having a baby this month and bought a dozen size 0 - I will need at least another dozen - but they grow out of them so quickly. I have heard they are THE best infant diaper. High resale value as well. 
These are great if you're looking into buying cloth diapers, very soft and cushy 
As a first time mom I am very nervous about my son getting germs. He likes to lick everything. I got this product and it fit nicely on every cart I ecountered except the Costco cart. The cart was too big. I was still able to cover to seat and the handle preventing AJ from "tasting the cart". I also like the fact the it is easily washable and has its own safety strap. The minor problem I can't seem to fold it up without carefully thinking about it. Otherwise it stays in my trunk and out of the way unitl I need it 
I've never written a review before and to be honest I didnt read the reviews on this item before I bought it. But I also hurt myself at work and the back pain was getting worse especially going into my third trimester. This back support made a big difference for me, it does work and I would recomend it. I only gave it 4 stars cause it does roll down a little on the sides of the back. Other than that its great and does its job 
I read the other reviews and thought I should order the lg/xl. Well, I guess I really didn't need that size, Med would have worked also. It gave me great support and eased the low back pain. I think it works excellent 
My Mom bought this for me, thinking it would help my back discomfort. Well, as I rolled my eyes at the idea I found relief! I was able to be up and about with no lower back discomfort. It is very discreet and I am not constantly walking around holding my back or belly. the belly sling, as we call it, is great and I would definitly recomend this product 
A friend of mine bought this item for me and at first I thought that "wasted" her money. I noticed that she bought it for me in L-XL and of course I thought this will never ever fit me, after all my pre-pregnancy size was a 4. Well, I was sooo wrong! Into my 3rd trimester, I developed discomfort in my lower abdomen and back. I decided to try this belt and it was a awesome! I've been able to continue working out, walking, etc... because of this belt. I love it!! My only suggestion is to buy the bigger size. 
Superb solution to the "where will my kid sleep while we're staying at ____?" problem. - Comes in a cool back pack for easy travel - Inflates quickly with included pump - Deflates quickly to save room in a cramped hotel or spare room - Rechargeable pump holds a charge for a long time - Comfy The only negatives I can think of are minor. The pump nozzle is a tad tough to fit into the inflation valve. The bed is a little large for tight spaces. It does lose some pressure over a couple days. Definitely recommended, though 
Bought this for my 2 year old grandaughter. She's tiny and was afraid of the bigger bed, so this was perfect for her. She loves the bed and sleeps very well in it 
Right from the moment it arrive my daughter loves it. She sleeps perfectly and has a dora stuffed to sleep with her at nightnight time 
Bed is great. Took a while to put together but have had absolutely no problems with it. My wife who weights about 125 lbs has laid on this bed and it has not even come close to falling apart. It states max weight should be 50 lbs but it appears to handle more than double. My daughter loves it and I recommend it if you dont mind the time it takes to put together. Sure it was a bit tricky but I believe the way the poles are made is for it to have more support. Loved the fact I could use the mattress from her crib. 
the first time we ordered this bed half the parts was missing. i called the wonderful customer service people and they sent a replacement bed. after a long wait it finally came. it was a little hard to put together but with good &amp;quot;know how&amp;quot; this bed can be put together within 30-45 min. it is very sturdy, i had my husband test it out, he jiggled and jubbled it and it stayed together perfectly. my daughter loves it 
This bed had easy to follow instructions which clearly state it is made for children under 50 pounds. It has stayed firmly together as we have read and followed the guidelines for proper assembly and use. My daughter is 2 and a half and weighs 32 pounds and we have had no problems with this bed! She loves it and so do about half her stuffed animals!!! I recommend buying this with the toy storage system she loves which makes it easy for her to pick up her room: 
Super cute bed, but my husband and I had a hard time putting it together. My daughter liked it for about 3 months and is now in a twin bed... It's great for her baby dolls 
This potty seat fits on the toilet and does not slip around. the child is secure and comfortable, rather than doing a balancing act. This goes a long way for a child trying his best to learn. Also, its easy to clean. 
Very sturdy chair and perfect size for our 16 month old. The quality is good, especially for the price. I would recommend this product 
Those looking for an inexpensive alternative to $45 wooden stools should consider this. My two year old can carry without risk of pinching fingers as well 
Our baby's been getting fussy. We started with gas drops and that nipped the problem in the bud. Then a couple of weeks ago, feeding time turned into a battle zone. Screaming, back arching, twisting and writhing, spitting formula while passing gas, burps sending formula up along with air. We were desperate. So I ran out and bought these bottles. The Good: The moment we switched, the screaming stopped. HOORAY! We still get a little screaming if we didn't get the bottle assembled properly and we have leaks, and it seems slightly harder to get burps out of baby, probably because there's less air going in so it takes longer to build up a good solid burp. The Bad: These bottles in the 3 pack only come with the stage 2 nipples. The flow on those was too fast, baby was drowning. I bought a bunch of stage 1 nipples and WHOA, we went from 125 mL per 30 minutes to 45 mL in an hour. I tried letting baby build up her sucking strength on these stage 1 nipples for about 3 days, then finally, out of desperation, came here to read reviews and see what others had to say. I bought the narrow Dr. Brown's Level 1 nipples. Baby's sucking had evolved by the time I got those home, and unfortunately, she sucks so hard after having used these crummy Playtex stage 1 nipples that she drowns some more when we use the alternative nipples. This solution would have worked well had I got these nipples the DAY that we noticed how slow the stage 1 Playtex nipples were. Needless to say, I thoroughly read through the instructions since the screaming had stopped and I was able to process information again. It recommends that you bring the nipple tip where the hole is closer to where baby's lips come together, meaning, don't allow more than 1/2 the nipple in baby's mouth while she's sucking. This has worked perfectly and we are now back to 100 mL in 30 minutes. PTL! The Ugly: In addition to needing a stage 1.5 nipple desparately (Come ON Playtex, Puuuuhleeeez!), the parts are a bit awkward. Not like Dr. Brown's, but you have the nipple, the ring, the bottle, the disk, and the vent cap. Lots of pieces to clean and keep up with, but easy to handle if they keep your kid from screaming at you for hours on end. Also, you are not supposed to use a bottle warmer on this. Guess what, I tried it anyway. Sometimes a bit of formula will leak thereby requiring cleanout of the bottle warmer. But it isn't too bad and we have been using the bottle warmer anyway, seems to be working out just fine for us. Take my advice-ASSEMBLE THE BOTTLES WHILE BABY's SLEEPING, YOU CAN'T SLAP THESE THINGS TOGETHER DURING A SCREAMY BABY EMERGENCY OR YOU WILL HAVE A MESS ON YOUR HANDS (and everywhere else). Bottom line is that our baby is eating again. So I would recommend, I just take away one star for the bad/ugly portions of my review. Edit: These bottles WERE a TEMPORARY answer to our prayers. However, we have switched to Avent bottles and they have worked great for us for two weeks now. My advice to parents looking for bottles to solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days. If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it. But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found "The Answer" 
When I registered for my baby shower, I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles (which is what I was wanting), so my review will discuss both types. NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIRE For starters, the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding, because the milk doesn't flow out when the bottle is tipped over. The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple. Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time. Approximately 40-45 minutes. However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily. So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked. I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles. He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well. He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes. These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles. REGULAR VENTAIRE Now for the regular Ventaire bottles. I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us. Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks. So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn't confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us. The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples. He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow. We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth. I didn't notice him getting choked, and he doesn't have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles. These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle. Now for the operation of both types of bottles. They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that. On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom. On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it's in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out). We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water. So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out. If you don't, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby's hand if s/he can hold the bottle). This isn't really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of. Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle. I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles. My son still burps just as much as the next baby. Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don't think it makes any difference 
My son was very fussy when he was new and had lots of gas. I had about seven or so of these bottles from an inlaw. I decided to use them and no gas and no more fussy baby. I continued to use them up until this month. I have no time for bottles with so many parts. My son is crawling and pulling up..so I am busy all the time. The bottles are great!!! I never in the seven months had a leak problem the wasn't strickly human error (mostly by my husband). It is a good idea to put them back to gether when clean they do consume time if you are in a hurry. You can buy replacement parts in my area( the nipple and bottom seals). Great bottle, Great buy!!! 
My baby is mostly breastfed, but Dad gives baby a bottle at night so I can get a few hours of uninterupted sleep. Baby loves this bottle and it really does keep air bubbles out of the milk. The only downfall is all the parts and putting them together. If I had it to do over, I would have tried the Playtex premium bottles with the drop ins 
This is a good quality gate which was not too difficult to install. We use it for 2 cats, and so we don't have to lock unlock the gate to pass through it, since the cats can't push the gate open. I liked the pressure gauge that was included with the unit. Very sturdy, very solid. It was well worth the cost 
My Pacifier holder came in a timely fashion and was just what I wanted and looked just the same as the picture on line. Thank you for your great service. Becki 
I really like the pattern on this changing pad. It matchs up my diaper bag; this is the only reason I bought it. I wish my diaper bag comes with this changing pad so that I don't have to spend extra money to buy it. Really I don't care about the pocket. 
With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money! 
We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the toilet when she wants. The Toilet Trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start 
When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward) 
We were given this potty (in blue) by a neighbor, and my son has had some great early success on it. It's comfy, and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend, in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair. Within days of his first success, he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success! However, we didn't find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use. We've purchased two others. One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son's "privates" landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down. Another had a high splash guard, but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down. He's become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it. No more. We're buying a 2nd Baby Bjorn right now and I'd highly recommend that anyone about to embark on the potty training journey with a boy do the same. Simply the most well-designed potty chair out there 
We bought 2 of these potty chairs. They were so easy to clean and stayed brand new looking that I sold both of them for 75% of their original list price when we were done with them. How cool is that? They maintained their value. Note: When potty training, don't forget to buy the character underwear. We bought Elmo Underwear with the baseball cap (sport theme) from ebay and it worked great. Trained within days!! 
I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works. Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things. She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read "the potty book for girls" She was immediately sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away. We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself. It is very basic and sturdy. My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front. I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the "big" potty 
I love the design of this chair. It's all one piece (except the bowl) and it's very stable. I like that there is a back for support. The removable bowl is convenient to empty and clean. I bought this for my third child, but I wish I had had it with my other two. 
These are great diaper covers. They seemed huge at first until I got the hang of them. They clean easily and dry fast, no special washing required! I think the elastic feels rough, but my little one doesn't seem to mind and there are no marks on her legs from them. These are great diapers for all kinds of cloth, prefolded and fitted diapers 
This is one of the best covers on the market and great for the price! You can use these with flat or prefolds without using pins or fasteners or it works with a fitted diaper 
I got these and the imse vimse covers for my daughter. At first I thought I'd like the IV more, because it seemed as though the fit better around the leg, but I changed my mind quickly. Not only do these fit just fine, but they are MUCH MORE DURABLE! After a few washings, the IV began to loose shape and the velcro began to warp (and I cold water wash and line dry). The BUmmis look just the same as when I got them (except for some stains). These covers will last me through the next few babies, I'm sure of it! My only complaint is that once your baby begins to push the weight limit it takes a little practice to get the velcro tabs to stick right. When my daughter weighed 14lbs. if I didn't fastened the tabs in just the right spot they would come undone, but it didn't take long to figure out and correct. After comparing these covers with others (my IV and the Bummis original the a friend of mine used), these covers COME OUT ON TOP! PS - I did wash the covers in cold water at first to make them last longer, but it's best to wash covers in hot water to disinfect. I started washing the Bummis in hot water (with my diapers) and they're still holding up fine. In response to the other review....these diapers DO have fold back tabs for the laundry. I bought these exact covers from this exact page and mine have them 
Like most reviewers, I too like this bather. It is much softer than the plastic tubs and folds for fairly easy storage (at least it is smaller to store than the plastic ones.) However, my son's little jaw chatters because he gets chilly because he is so far out of the water. I DO fill my tub up high with water, but the angle of the chair doesn't allow for him to have enough of his body safely submerged. I think it would be great for warmer weather, but January and February in the Midwest are cold. I also wish that the manufacturer would make the washer and bold on the underside a plastic piece. It has rusted on my model too 
I purchased this as a baby registry gift for an out of state friend. They keep raving on how great it is. 
We started with the tub to seat bath complete universal bath system by first years, but it was way too small for our baby and he slid around in it so much that we switched to bathing him in the sink while we supported him. When he outgrew the sink, we needed an alternative, so we bought this bather. It's a lot like his bouncy seat, which he loves and is very comfortable in. This is much easier than supporting all of his weight with one arm and bathing him with the other while he squirms around. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it's lacking 2 things that would make it perfect. One is a strap like in the bouncy to keep him from sliding down, though he doesn't slide too bad (not like in the tub), the other is that it needs suction cups on the bottom to hold it in place in the tub better 
I was given a hand-me-down changing pad that I used for my 1st 2nd child but it was really looking bad when baby #3 came, so I broke down and bought this. I love it! My covers fit on snug but easily and the strap has been so nice to hold baby on for a few seconds while I grab something instead of making one of my other children stand beside the baby to keep her from rolling! My child also loves to play with the strap and it keeps her occupied during changes 
I have been using this changing pad for two years and it works great. The only problem is it can rip. I am buying a new one for my next child but this time I will buy a changing pad cover to go over it 
I purchased this pillow for my son as I was tired of seeing him slumped over in his car seat while he slept. With the RestUpRight pillow, he is secure and alligned in his carseat and sleeps with a straight spine. The pillow is adjustable and the fabic is really soft. Also, its VERY easy to use!! It is well-made and it comes with straps so that the pillow goes over the seatbelt and it does not slip down while he sleeps 
I've been stumped in trying to find something for the car for my son to use that wouldn't bother my other two kids (we have a Lincoln Town Car, so it's tight in the backseat) and this pillow has been our pillow SALVATION! Works perfectly, my son's head doesn't loll around and it's narrow design keeps him in his own personal space! AWESOME!!!!!!!! I'm ordering the adult version RIGHT NOW 
Ok just so you guys know, as a student of child development and safety, your child WILL NOT suffocate due to a use of bumper pads. The only reason this has happened is because the parents have not securely positioned their sleeping child and the child rolls over, buries his or her face in the bumper, and suffocates. You should, however, remove the bumpers once your child is able to pull him or her self to a standing position in the crib, since the bumper can be used as a step to climb up and fall out. I hope this puts some of your minds at ease. 
I recieved this bumper as a shower gift and I really like the colors and the quality. The only thing is that it doesn't come with instructions on how to attach it to your crib and its not as self-explanitory as one might think it would be. The picture on the packaging shows the pattern facing inwards towards the baby, and no bumper on the sliding side rail so I guess you have to double it back on the sides but the ties end up weird that way. We'll see how it works out, but otherwise its a good quailty bumper 
I received the safari bedding as a shower gift. I have the comforter, the bumper pad, the dust ruffle, two fitted sheets, and the rug. I also received the nightlight and valances as shower gifts. I was able to find the safari border at a Target Greatland in my area. It really adds to the room. I was also able to find the wall hangings, but I'm not sure if I will use them or not. Everything is well-made, and we hope to use it for baby number one, as well as other children that we might have in the future 
For safety reasons I was reluctant to purchase a bumper. After looking at this one in person and seeing that it had ties on top and bottom I decided to purchase it. My daughter did fine without it but I like the color it brought to the crib. I wanted her to be able to see the cute animal design so I have the pattern facing in toward her. Her crib has a drop down side so I have the bumper pad running across the back and ends of the crib. I took the excess pad and wrapped it back around the outside of each crib end and tied it. None of the solid blue shows. I am very pleased with the quality of this bumper pad and highly recommend it 
I love this bumper. The embroidered animals are plush and very cute. Colorful too. Just about any color in the set you can use to paint/decorate the rest of your nursery with. I just wish the inside of this bumper also had the patchwork/animal design on it. Instead it is just plain blue--like the trim on the outside. So, when you walk into the room and look into the crib, what you will see is basically a blue bumper. Other than that, its a nice bumper--the set is great 
Relatively easy to hang. We used additional glue for pre-pasted paper because we read elsewhere that it was necessary. Overall a relatively good product 
I bought this border to accessorize my Froggy Tales collection. It matches beautifully with the set. It is a little tricky to hang. I found that just adding water to the prepasted back was not quite enough to make it stick well. I added wallpaper paste to it to assure it's adherance. I also liked that it is a double roll and covers 30 feet rather than the standard 15 of most wallpaper borders. It makes my Froggy Tales Set complete 
This is as light as an umbrella stroller but performs like a big bulky one. I will be able to use it as my grandson grows. I would recommend this to my friends 
Awesome item that is the right size and works great 
My daughter just turned 1 year old. She's on the tiny side so I was concerned as to what type of carseat I was going to purchase. I read many reviews on Britax and it seemed like the company to go with. I loved the print of this and my daughter looks so cute in it. Not to mention that she finds it much easier to fall asleep in this seat than in her infant carrier. My husband said it was fairly easy to install and I know getting her in and out as well as adjusting the straps is a breeze. It was a perfect buy and I would recommendend to anyone 
We purchased this car seat for our daughter when she turned one and was 20 lbs. We loved our Peg Perego infant seat but she was clearly outgrowing it and uncomfortable. So far she loves this seat and I love the safety profile and color. She enjoys riding in this seat as it has plenty of room and fits her size well. The only 2 flaws that I find I personally dislike is 1. that you do not hear a distict "click" when you buckle the 5 point harness. For me this is juat a reassurance that it locked. 2. I dislike the rubber strap covers and may consider cutting them off. They make the straps harder to maneuver. I do like the velcro attachments on the side that allow you to pull the straps apart when you put the baby in. This is a real time and effort saver. Overall we really love the seat. We also purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our secondary car and it is a good seat overall but not as nice as the Britax. Plus the Britax goes to 65 lbs and the Graco only 40. Britax is definitely worth the money and the better seat for the primary car 
My thoughts about this product, I hope they will help you to decide. I had already purchased a Britax car seat that was a neutral color, thinking I'd be happy with that. Wrong! So I return the neutral color and went for the Floral pattern, which I love looking at and so does my husband! The price was more than I thought the "next level" should cost, but well worth it. I spent a good amount of time at the store looking/feeling the other car seats. This model is very durable, good feel of the material, and it's going to last!!! My only disappointment is the velcro tabs, which is a great idea to hold the straps to the side to allow you to place your child in the seat. The velcro tabs are located about an inch too high. 
I love this car seat, but more importantly, my 7-month old baby girl seems to love it too. We switched her to this seat when she was 6 months old, and car rides have been a whole lot better. She has plenty of room and it reclines better than her infant car seat (Graco snugride), and it is well padded. We call it the princess' throne. My husband was shocked at first at how much this thing costs, but now he understands why. This was so easy to install and very safe. I love the latch system--the thing barely moves. You can't put a price on safety. Plus this will grow with her until maybe she's about 5. Also, you cannot go wrong with this beautiful fabric. I love it--not another pink, but very girlie and sweet. I LOVE IT! WELL WORTH THE $$ 
What a great seat!!! Excellent growth for the long term. I especially like the sides of the seat that offer great side impact protection. Also a five point harness that accomodates a child up to 65lbs and 49" in length. The 5-point harness was super easy to use and adjust. Seat installation was a breeze with the latch system included. I bought my seat online at travelingtikes.com who's prices were far lower than any other advertised price by more than fifty dollars shipping included.....right on! I purchsed the tan seat "portland" that best matched our car interior. Im so happy that Britax is rated so well and that their seat is such a household name which made my purchase that much easier to research. My little guy is styling!!! 
My wife and I each have seat in our car for carrying our 18-month-old toddler. She has a Britax Marathon convertible car seat. I have a Cosco Eddie Bauer Deluxe 3-in-1 car seat. Neither of us has had any problems using the Britax seat with thick harness straps that don't twist. The lap-buckle system on the Britax harness is easy to use and can be undone with one hand. The seat cover was also easy to remove when my daughter spilled juice all over her seat. In contrast, within 2 weeks using the Cosco seat and wrestling my toddler into the harness, the thin harness straps on my Cosco seat were a twisted mess, that just kept getting worst. The overlapping buckle system is a pain to line up and use. I've finally decided to give up on the Cosco seat. I got tired of trying to straighten the harness straps and to fasten the complicated buckle. I just ordered another Britax Marathon 
I just love this high chair so does my 7 month old. It puts him right up to the table with the rest of the family. It's easy to attach to the table and easy to dettach it and store. And its easy to fold up and take it with you. 
The Easy Diner is so nice to take with you anywhere. It sometimes can be a little hard to fold up or I would have given it 5 stars. I just hope it lasts for a while. 
My son is one years old, and he's about 27lbs. This Chair is very strong, and steady once clap on the table. One shortcome is it has to be installed on a very strong or heavy table, otherwise the table will not stay put with the weight of my son. So I'm not able to use it at all restaurants though 
This item works wonderful and is very easy to clean. The cover slips off and can be thrown in the washer. I prefer this type of high chair over the larger free-standing ones. Very convenient and can be taken anywhere 
If you have a baby, you've gotta have a Regalo Portable High Chair. It is the most convenient item I've seen since strollers. It is very high quality in design and materials. The directions are a breeze. It washes easily, travels easily, looks nice and is just the perfect item if you are granny and live in a small apartment but want the grandbaby to eat with you often. The parents love it too because they take it to restaurants to avoid using the "contaminated" restaurant chairs. It is perfect for so many reasons. Get one today. You'll be glad you did 
I recommend this product to all new moms without hesitation. This product is awesome! My baby slept for much longer using the Swaddleme. I'm only sad that my baby has outgrown the size large at only 15 pounds (at 4 months), but he seems to have lost the startle reflex, which is the reason he badly needed the Swaddleme in the first place. This is one of those items that is a "must have," and I will be buying for all baby showers. I tried another brand of a similar blanket and wasn't nearly as impressed; the velcro did not stay attached. The microfleece is warm and washes well. 
This was a good buy for me. The baby wrapper is ideal for newborns 
Had a few swaddle blankets...my son HATED being swaddled...so this blanket worked out well for us...he would fall asleep at the breast and then I could lay him down ON this blanket and wrap him up in it while he was asleep (no battles) and he was snug in his blanket which helped him sleep longer and better...but the other blankets required wrapping and flipping under him, etc...which woke him or if I swaddled him while awake, he would cry and fuss...so this was my swaddling savior...I have since bought more for my baby due sooN! :) 
We swaddled our daughter every time she goes down to take a nap. When winter came around, we wanted something warmer to swaddle her in (because we don't use blankets with her) and we came across these. They are super easy to use and the microfleece makes them warm enough for our New England winters 
I *LOVE* this product. It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro. In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles. I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out. On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme. However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot. Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty. It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling. On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free. The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures. It is trickier to find, but worth the search. The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier. The velcro is quite versatile. 
Shortly after I found out I was pregnant with our 2nd child, I bought a SwaddleMe on a whim. I knew the benefits of swaddling a newborn from having done so with our 1st child, and the SwaddleMe caught my attention with its design and overall ease of properly swaddling a baby. At that time, I didn't know exactly how handy this little blanket/wrap would be. Our baby is now 2½ weeks old and this product has become one of the most important baby items we own. Our daughter was fussy and just couldn't seem to settle down...until I pulled out the SwaddleMe and wrapped her up in it. The instant change in her personality was unreal. She's now a happy and content baby and the fussy crying has all but stopped. The only time she doesn't "wear" her SwaddleMe is during diaper and clothing changes and in her carseat - any other time of the day, she's snuggly wrapped up. Swaddling a baby with a regular blanket can be a bit tricky, but this specially-shaped wrap makes it super easy. The velcro tabs ensure that the baby can't accidentally loosen the wrap and unswaddle him or herself. I highly recommend this wonderful blanket/wrap to anyone who is expecting or has a newborn baby 
When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
Very well constucted. It was a gift and the new parents loved it 
My husband and I bought this because our baby was born right before we would be moving back to the US. We are very happy with it as it makes traveling with a baby a breeze. We never have to worry if the hotel we're in provides cribs, or if they are safe for that matter. We have had it for almost three months now, using it exclusivly, and the only thing wrong is a small tear in the fabric. I had no trouble setting this up, however I did try it out before the baby came so I wasn't exhausted at the time. I don't think it would have gone the same if I was. I can't imagine what we would have done without this thing 
I purchased the mini co-sleeper for my first child. She slept in it at our bedside until she was 6 months old. I really feel that her being beside me helped us all sleep better. If she woke up and was fussing, I could just reach over and pat her, find her pacifier, etc. without having to get out of bed and walk to the nursery every time. Often I could comfort her before she really got good and awake/upset and I could get her back to sleep faster. At 6months, she was getting too large for it, so I transitioned her to her own crib in the nursery with no problem. The only drawback is that it is not very easy to fold up for travel-I had to get my husband to do it for me every time. BUT, I have yet to find a portable crib that is very easy to fold up (we have a Pack and Play too). When you do get it folded up and put into its carrying case, it doesn't take up that much room. Can be used as a co-sleeper by the parent's bed or as a free-standing bassinet. Overall, I have been pleased and will use it again with my next baby 
If you want to have your baby near you at night, the co-sleeper is great. It makes getting in and out of bed a bit of a challenge, but it is nice to be able to look over and see my infant daughter sleeping, or to comfort her back to sleep with a little rocking with my hand if she is not ready to get up. VERY easy to set up and sturdy. My only complaint is the sheet- it shrinks a lot in the wash, gets tangled up because of the velcro, and is not easy to change quickly. Also, replacement sheets are expensive (@$15). Instead, I recommend using a bassinet sheet- they are exactly the right size, are softer, and are around $5 
I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It's perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do. Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room. Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average. They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper. 
So when my son got to the toddler stage, I was worried about how to keep him warm in his stroller. We live in the city, so travel by stroller is a way of life. He loves to be outside, but really dislikes being covered up - you can see the source of needing this product! Overall, we have found this product to be very good - it is machine washable, it is warm for my son (16 months at the time of purchase), there is room for him to grow into it a bit this winter, it fits our Maclaren Quest stroller nicely, and it is attractive. The only downsides we have noted are that we wish it had one zipper up the middle, instead of having a zipper up each side. The reason for this is that we think it would be tougher for our son to get his hands out of the bag this way - he is nothing short of Houdini-like, however, in his ability to get himself out of outwear and protective items like this bag, so it may not matter at all. The other thing is that is does not attach to the stroller as securely as we would like - it has a tendency to slide down the front, and eventually, usually on a rainy day, the bottom of the bag drags on the ground a bit. However, going back to the fact that it is washable, this is not a huge complaint either. This may also be a function of the stroller with which you are trying to use this. I would recommend this product to anyone with a squirmy toddler who loves being outside as much as my son does 
Just received the bag. The material seems very strong. A reviewer on another site mentioned that the only thing missing is a cushioned shoulder strap, so what I plan to do is use the removable velcro cushions that came with my daughter's infant carseat and put them on the straps so that my shoulders won't hurt. Haven't used it yet but plan to take it on a plane real soon, I'm just happy that the booster seat is so awesome and that it folds. Update: didn't need the cushions because it's pretty light anyway. carseat fits well, it protects the seat well when you check it at the airport. 
When I first saw this set I was in love. The colors are really girly, fun, and prettty. I have the the entire set from this collection and I just adore it. Great for when you little bundle of joy gets older too since it is not to 'babyish' 
My only complaint about this potty topper concerns the stick-in-place double sided tape. The peel-off backing is difficult to remove from the tape with out tearing the potty topper. It takes a bit of time to get off, and if you have a toddler dancing around the bathroom stall, doing the pee-pee dance, you don't have the luxury of a lot of time. Also, when the 'deed is done', and it's time to remove the potty seat cover, you again need to be very careful, or the tape will tear off the cover, and remain on the toilet seat. Then you have to pick it off with your fingernail - YUCK! I think a 'post-it note' kind of stick-in-place would be much better than the double sided tape. The seat cover doesn't need to stick to the seat forever, just long enough for my toddler to tinkle. Other than that, this is great. After my toddler finished, I used it too, and found it to be very comfy. It was cushiony, and provided a warm layer over a cold toilet seat. I didn't have to worry about anything leaking through, as it seems to be water-proof. It was large enough to cover the enitre seat, even those large public toilet seats. I will continue to use these, as they do provide the layer of protection I am looking for, but I will need to be extra careful with the tape, until something better comes on the market 
Really cute, very portable "plush" sports bag w. various balls...and the best part is it's NOT Electronic!! Each ball makes some sort of jingle or crinkle or "boing" sound...but they're great for baby to just handle or chew 
Love the boing sound in Tigger and rattle in Eeeyore. Fits good and holds a sippy cup too -or some snacks! Great value.. 
We bought this just for travel purposes. For a couple years we've traveled extensively with our big bulky stroller and while that was great for holding carry-ons, it was a pain to move around. So this one is fine for what we use it for: quick trips to the park, moving our two year old around the airport and to toss in the back of the car just in case we need it at the mall. It is a rough ride and kind of squashes him on the sides (he's now 31 pounds) but like I said, it is not our main stroller. I'm 5'5" and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5'11" husband thinks it is fine. We live in CA so being able to fold up the back for a little air circulation is handy but not used so often. I would definitely recommend this if you need to save money or have need for a good quality cheap stroller 
We purchased this stroller to take to WDW. We were pleased with this stroller. We were able to easily collapse to get on and off buses, it is very easy to manuever. Despite it's light weight, I was able to put three to four jackets one bag on the back of it without it turning over -- even without my three yr old in the stroller! (It did tip over once or twice, it just took a lot more than I expected it would to tip.) I didn't have problems with the handles being too short (I'm 5'7"), but my husband did (6'3"). But overall, the only way it could have been better would to be to have one little cup holder. I've had three different umbrella strollers and this is by far the BEST one I've owned. It's ability to maneuver through crowds and turn quickly is simply excellent! For the price, I would not / could not have purchased a better umbrella stroller 
We are both tall hubby is 6'2 and I am 5'10 and this is not a back breaker like most strollers. Great ite 
I already bought the Noah's Ark design for this type of display; we keep it in the living room (I reviewed that display in more detail). We purchased this one for our son's bedroom. I wish the canvas came in more colors than just red, but the natural wood is beautiful. It was very easy to put together - only took a couple of minutes. It's sturdy, but light-weight. It holds all sizes of books, and can hold anywhere from 12 to 36 books depending on their size and shape. The 1st Guidecraft book display help us teach our son to respect his books. He took such good care of them (like putting them back in the display instead of throwing them on the floor), that we have been able to introduce paperbooks to our 18 month-old, and he doesn't try to tear them apart. I think this type of book display is more practical for children's books than a traditional bookshelf, due to shapes and sizes 
Very cute way to cleverly protect your child and keep them close. We have a two year old and going to an amusement park with his other sibilings, having to have him hold your hand (yeah, right--not all the time). He likes to be independent and loves dogs and backpacks so he feels like the older kids. This helps, and doesn't look like you have your kid on a leash 
I got these when I developed cracked and bleeding nipples with my 2nd child. They are the ONLY thing that helped. No amount of lanolin would relieve that initial latch pain. Once I started using these, the pain went away. It was a miracle! I had to use just a couple pairs. They may seem expensive, but you don't have to use a new pair at each feeding like you do with other brands. With my 3rd child, I used these from the start and never got sore. And now with my 4th, I will be sure to have them on hand 
A few days after I got home from the hospital I was thinking of stopping to breasfeed because my nipples were so sore and in such pain (even though baby was latched on just fine). These pads worked miracles! Put them in the refrigerator and the apply them to your nipples right after feeding. You will feel GREAT! These truly saved me. Now baby is 6 months old and still breasfeeding...I'm sooooo glad I did not stop....thanks to these pads (and chamomile tea applications). They might be a bit pricey but VERY worth it! 
It does take a lot to get this lock open, but it's literally the only thing that worked in my house for more than 24 hours. Everything else was too easy to pull off. 
I've been using these bibs for my 8-9 month old son, and they work great. They fit the baby well, provide good coverage and are waterpfoof. I like them a lot and wanted to get a second set, but they are so easy to clean and dry that we just use the same set over and over 
What else can I say? Fits my Bugaboo perfectly and never fails me 
I don't have any stroller age kids, but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack. The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification, and it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom, but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle! After it broke I found the Valco, which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar. It seems a lot tuffer, and some closed handle mugs will fit. Best thing is I'll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas 
Looks great with the set. Better than the green sheet. Get 2 of these instead or try the carters/tykes safari print sheets. Colors are cheery and fabric is soft jersey material 
I GOT THIS PUMP AT THE HOSPITAL AND IT WORK GREAT FOR ME. I CAN PUMP MORE MILK WITH THIS ONE THAN WITH MY ELECTRIC PUMP. I USED THIS ONE INSTEAD THAN MY ELECTRIC PUMP WHEN WATCHING TV. IS A MANUAL PUMP SO YOU WILL GET A WORK OUT USING IT. IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE ELECTRIC MEDELA PUMP THATS GREAT, BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PUMP OFTEN THIS WORKS GREAT. IS VERY EASY TO TAKE WITH YOU AND HELP IN TIMES YOU ARE ENGORGE AND THE BABY CAN'T LATCH TO DRINK 
I have really used this sunshade this summer. If fits really well with both the single stroller and the jog stroller that I own. It comes on and off easily and doesn't interfer with anything. It provided both sun protection and wind protection (when pulled all the way down) so I ended up using it on cooler days also. The SPF is also a bonus as you don't realize how much sun can be directed at the little one even with a regular shade 
This item is GREAT! I have a 5 month old and a 3 year old. I was looking for something to help protect the baby from the sun so we could still be out doing all the fun summer things with our 3 year old and this works great. I have used it with my single regular stroller, my umbrella stroller (it has a small canopy to attach to, and on the front portion of my sit n stand stroller. It has worked great with all three strollers in all weather conditions and it wraps up into a small carrying case! Think I am getting a double to attach to the rented theme park strollers for the rest of the summer 
I love this item for a baby that is only going to take an occasional bottle so mommy and daddy can have a date, etc. I use mine a little differently. I put the liner (I use the cheaper soft bags) directly into the bottle. Then I screw on the collar and pump adaptor. I pump directly into the bottle then screw off the adaptor and screw on a lid (nipple ring with a plug in it). Then when the baby sitter goes to feed the baby, she does not have to take off the collar and risk loosing the bag of milk. She just screws off the top lid and screws on a nipple (using a contrasting color nipple ring with the plug for a lid may help distinguish which part should be unscrewed). (This also solves that problem of having the milk raised above the readings on the bottle.) Only thing I don't understand is why they don't give you more of the plugs that go in the lids. You wouldn't need the lids if they would just give you the plugs, you could put them in the rings that go with your bottles.... I know this is confusing; you kind of need to be looking at the pieces to understand what I'm talking about. For occasional bottling, 1 newborn gift set and 1 breastmilk storage kit is more than enough for what I need. My babies definately take to the nurser nipple easier, so that is how I ended up with this system. Everything washes in the dishwasher, so clean up is easy 
I wish more people knew about this storage system. It is so convenient - pump straight into the liners, twist on the caps, and store in the fridge or freezer. Once the milk has frozen, pop off the caps, pop out the liners and store them in freezer bags. When needed, just pop a liner back into a nurser and it's ready to go. The bottles heat quickly and easily in hot water. It's so easy to clean the pieces - just soak in hot soapy water for a minute and rinse. I bought 4 or 5 storage systems - I can bring 4 caps to work, send 4 bottles to daycare, and have several bottles stored in the fridge or freezer. My son, almost 5 months old, has had no problems bottle-feeding with the Playtex nursers and the NaturaLatch slow flow nipples. Highly recommend!! 
I absolutely love this storage system! After showing it to one of my girlfriends, she replaced everything she used for baby #1 with Playtex and used the Playtex system for baby #2. It is a very clean and simple system and minimizes the risk of contamination since you do not have to transfer milk from one storage device to another. It worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style; you use the same bag for pumping, storing and feeding. I have a deep-freeze chest freezer and used this for storage. I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to double bag for freezing. I never had any problems. If you want to see how much your baby is eating, with clean hands, simply lift the bag out of the ring and drop it directly into the bottle shell (the ring is heavy-duty enough that it lifts out easily). Remember, when you are breastfeeding baby directly from the breast, you don't see how much baby is getting. Dr. Sears says, "A baby who is getting a sufficient volume of milk will usually have at least 6-8 wet cloth diapers (4-6 disposable diapers) per day after the initial three days of start-up time. Enough wet diapers tell you that your baby is safe from dehydration." Everyone has different preferences, but I honestly can't see how anyone could be dissapointed with this storage kit. I only purchased two kits because most of the time, I fed directly from the breast, and eventually, dd wouldn't take a bottle, but for moms who plan to return to work, I would recommend more kits. I really only used my kits in the beginning when I was pumping a lot because I had so much milk 
Works perfectily withthe embrace double breast pump!!! We were in need of storing milk and getting alot of it stored when my wife went back to work. Now I can just go to the fridge and take out a bottle and warm it up and ready to go! Also helps out alot when we started taking our son to the babysitters 
I bought this product thinking that it would work well with the other playtex bottles, nipples, etc. that I already have. It seems to be working out great. I can pump using my Medela pump right into the storage receptacles and then put them right into the fridge. If I'm on the run one afternoon, I grab one and go. It's so easy and even the cleaning is easy. Only a couple things to wash and you're done. That means a lot to me when you're constantly cleaning other things around the house. I'm one very happy customer 
I really like this booster seat. The cushioning is soft and comfortable for my son. I also like the head rest. Some reviews I read talked about how the head rest acted like blinders for their children. My son doesn't mind them at all and they keep his head stable when he sleeps which I love 
We purchased Britax Bodyguards for our children when they first came out because they were the first booster to provide side impact protection for their heads, just like the more current Parkway model. I had the same complaints as others at first about the seats impeding the kids' views, but they quickly grew accustomed to the seats (and I loved that their heads were well-supported when they fell asleep on long trips). Last week, my daughter and I were in a car accident where we were blindsided from the right. Thanks to those 'wings' around her head, she doesn't seem to have suffered any injuries from what was a serious collision. I bought new Parkways for each of the kids the day after the accident, as I wouldn't want my kids to ride in any other booster seat 
This seat is a wonderful transition from our daughter's Roundabout. The reasons why I could not give it 5 stars are the following: poorly designed cup holders; an early tear in the fabric; no secure anchoring. Cup holders: we've already spilled juice that's been left in the cup holders. They are completely useless and should have been better designed. Fabric: though the material looks resilient, a tear has developed near the lower left corner where her leg sits... I am assuming that this is because the chair is mounted behind the driver's seat, and therefore it gets a lot of traffic as our daughter boards and disembarks the car - nonetheless, we expected something a little more durable. Anchors: the seat wobbles around and doesn't really hold our daughter in place. She is often reaching over to pick something up, and the seat nearly topples over. I am not sure why this wasn't considered in the design. It makes it easy to remove and install, but I'd rather have something a little more stable 
I bought this for my 4 year old daugher. i liked the safety review for this seat. my daughter loves everything about it. I don't have one bad thing to say about this seat. i've had it for about 3 months and it looks like it did when i pulled it from the box. she has spilled everything you could think of on it and you can't tell. it even still smells new! the cushion is just as good as the first day she used it. i will buy another for my 18 month old daughter when she is big enough 
The seat worked great. We bought the seat because we could not stand the way my 3 yearolds head would hang when she went to sleep in the car. This seat offers support for sleeping children. However the same neck support prevents them from looking side to side with ease ( kind of like blinders) 
I tried a few boosters before settling on the Britax Parkway. First we tried the Jupiter booster. My daughter is a tiny girl (5yrs.old- 36 lbs. 43 inches tall). She was way too tiny for the Jupiter. The shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder and her head wasn't supported when she slept in the car. Another thing i didn't like about the Jupiter was that the padding under her bottom felt too thin and she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides. Then we tried the Graco. It is a good seat. But no head support unless you lay the seat back a ways. I didn't like the plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter's cheek sleeping on it. Next we tried the Parkway (Britax). This booster is by far the best booster on the market in my opinion. I am a huge Britax fan. All my kids have been britax babies. My 3 year old and 4 month old currently sit in the Marathon (britax). This booster has enough padding to keep the kids comfortable, the head rests keep their heads from flopping. My daughter likes the way the fabric feels (she is very sensitive). Even though the Graco booster seat looks like the Parkway, and the Graco is $50 less than the Parkway, I still didn't like the fact that the red seat belt guides (on the Graco) looked like they would hurt to rest my head on. Britax thought of everything with this seat. I HIGHLY recommend this seat. Fork over the extra cash and splurge on your child's safety!! You'll be glad you did 
My wife and I are very happy with this highchair. The adjustable height works well, as well as the reclining positions for the back of the seat. It folds up to be relatively thin for storage, and the wheels are a nice touch. Unfortunately, the entire tray assembly, while great in its ability to chose how close or far it is from the baby, requires two hands to remove or adjust. Thankfully, the 5-point-harness will keep even the squirmiest of babies safely in place while you use those two hands to take care of the tray. It would have been nice to have a few more themed toys or gadgets. The tiger-teething-ring is nice (attaches to the tray so it won't fall on the floor), but most other Fisher-Price high chairs in this price range come with a LOT MORE for the baby to do. And that's our only hangup. Otherwise, this is a good value 
I purchased this crib because of its price and the colour. I was nervous about buying without seeing a model one first. My husband put it together in a couple of hours with no major drama. My daughter has used it since she was 6 weeks old, she is now 14 months. I love it, it is sturdy and beautiful, the drawer underneath has valuable storage (we are in NYC), it was easy for me to lower as my daughter grew. I think it is practical that it can be converted into a bed 
I was a little worried when ordering this crib because several people said they had problems with shipping and they said they never received the product. I didnt have any problems with the shipping. I received the crib withing the number of day's stated when I ordered (7-14 days). We had no trouble putting the crib together. I would suggest having two people put it together just because it is easier if one person can hold parts of the crib while the other person screws it together. It looks very nice. I have no complaints. 
I shopped for months to find a 3 in 1 that was of good quality but wasnt to pricey. We just moved our 7 month old son from our bed to this crib. He transitioned nicely. It arrived 1 day later than projected. It was fairly easy to put it together (I did it by myself, my hubby is mechanically challenged). I did break a plastic piece as I assembled it. The company sent a replacement, free of charge. I received the replacement in 4 days. The only thing I could complain about is the latching system, it works fine, but I feel they could do a better design 
My son was born premature. I breastfed for as long as I could but after he was diagnosed with severe acid reflux. I needed to find a bottle. He needed cereal in every bottle to thicken it, along with medications for pain and to help move it along his digestive track. First I tried the playtex bottles with disposable liners. The amount of gas and spit up was still quite a lot and I still had a unhappy baby. Then my doctor told me about Dr. Brown's bottles. They are a bit more expensive then others but WORTH EVERY DIME!!!! The clean up is fine too if you just throw all the pieces together in a nipple basket in the dishwasher. I will never use another bottle with my future children ever again. I am so happy I found these. My son was like a different baby from the FIRST time he used these bottles. The gas was GONE, the spit-up was decreased by well over half the previous amount. I tell every mother and soon-to-be mother I run into about Dr. Brown's bottles. I'll never buy another brand 
My baby boy hates to eat. At 7 months old, he was only taking at the most 4 oz of milk per feeding. We tried all kinds of nipples and bottles. I picked up these bottles and right when i got home, he ate 8 oz. in one feeding. Since then, he still doesn't like to eat, but at least we get some milk in his little belly. 
When my baby was 2wks old she developed excessive gas and was very cranky, she would not allow me to put her down at all. I bought a 2oz Dr. Brown bottle and fed her that night. She has not suffered with excessive gas since and is a much happier baby. I truly recommend Dr Brown bottles 
I initially tried the Avent wide-neck bottles for my newborn and didn't like them. Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them. You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal). The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk. My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles. My son doesn't have reflux but I can't imagine using any other bottle for him. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy agai 
My son was born nine weeks early and had trouble when the NICU started bottle feeding him. The hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking for him. Once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find to try. Dr. Brown's was the third one we tried and it worked fantastic for him. The nipples fed him slow but did not require too much effort for him. Once we started him on this bottle, he started eating exactly as he should and has not had a problem since. We also had to use Nutramigen formula which also helped with gas and reflux, but for us it was the nipple and the ease of use for him. The downside for us was that they don't fit well in our dishwasher so we hand wash all of them. When we go out we put dry formula in each bottle and carry bottled water with us. When we need to mix a bottle we take out the inside pieces, put the cap on and screw the neck and nipple back on, shake it well and replace the inside and we have no problem with shaking - just take out the inside piece. 
My son was born seven weeks early, and was bottle-fed in the NICU. When he came home, we had a few frustrating days trying to find a bottle he liked. These bottles are great! They are the only ones I could find that offered a preemie nipple. The other bottles drowned him, but these were just right 
Our baby had some problems with gas when she was very small, even though she was nursing. When she took a bottle, we started using these and we did notice a difference. I can imagine that they're not quite as convenient when mixing formula, since it says all over the instructions not to shake liquid in the bottles 
I love these bottles and have been using them for my twin girls since week 2 of their lives (week 1 was spent fighting with the wide necked version of this bottle) Once we figured out how to prevent all leaks, these bottles are amazing and speed up feeding time since baby can drink continuously. HELPFUL HINT for all Dr. Brown bottles: When pulling nipple thru the collar, everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle. Eliminates leaks completely. And do NOT over-tighten collar onto bottle. Again, will prevent leaks. We learned all of these tricks the hard way! :) Mother of twin girls from Texa 
Children have been seriously injured or killed by televisions falling on them. This product is a great idea, as long as it's secured to a stand or shelf that can't move. This one's definitely worth the $ to keep your child(ren) safe 
My monitor is excellent as the others reviewed, but be careful with ceiling fans! When my fan is on the sensor is detecting movement when it shouldn't (baby is not in crib). If you have the fan on the movement detection is inaccurate. Be sure to test this under all circumstances (when you have something in the room on that vibrates/moves, etc...) 
I absolutely love this monitor. If I were to recommend only one baby item, it would be this. In 2.5 months, the monitor has gone off twice. I have no idea if they were false alarms or not, because by the time I sprinted to her crib, she had already been startled out of her deep sleep by the beeping of the monitor, which I like. Even though she was a healthy, full-term baby with a 9 on both her Apgars in a non-smoker household and the risk for SIDS is low for her, I have a great peace of mind knowing her breathing is monitored at all times 
Both my babies slept through after three weeks, and I found myself sitting next to them half the night checking their breathing. So I got the angelcare, and only checked for one night, found that it worked (it is easily tested by taking the baby out, the alarm goes off after 10 secs), and had peaceful nights ever after. Happy to recommend it to everybody!!! 
We received this monitor off our registry. For a long time we never used the sensor pad. We felt we didnt need it. A few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach in the middle of the night unbeknownst to us. We would turn her only to find her moments later, or even hours later, on her stomach. We finally let her sleep on her tummy becuase it was obvious that was where she wanted to be. So the pressure pad is so sensitive that it picks up a 3 month old's breathing. we have only had a few false alarms but that was becuase she was way over in the corner of the crib. Hope that helps 
We splurged a little to get this monitor but we are very happy we did so. I sleep much better at night knowing that my baby's breathing is being monitored. The instructions indicate the sensor pad should be placed under the mattress directly under your baby with no bedding or padding in between. However, I've found the sensor will work even through a mattress, bedding, and a one inch thick sleep positioner. It's SUPER SENSITIVE which is GREAT! One thing to keep in mind - You should not have a ceiling fan on at night or have a strong draft in the room (such as an AC vent blowing directly onto your baby's crib). The unit will pick up air movement in the room. I highly recommend this product! I would not be resting at night as peacefully as I am without it 
This monitor gives us such peace of mind when our son is sleeping. So many of our friends have the video monitors, but even though you can see your baby, how can you tell they are breathing? As far as false alarms, we only had one and it was because he wiggled off of the pad. We would recommend this monitor to anyone with children. 
My youngest could NOT sleep without this sleepsack. We bought the very biggest ones available (XL) so she wouldn't outgrow them and she used them most of her first year. A fantastic shower gift, too 
How many times a night do you go into your baby's room to make sure the covers are still on them? Yeah, well, you can stop doing that now. Just buy this. The sack zips in the opposite direction so as not to catch on baby's skin. I must have washed this thing a trillion times and it held up wonderfully. Just put your baby in his/her pajamas and zip them up in the Halo Sleep Sack. It doesn't look like much but it certainly keeps them warm! I must have pointed and laughed at my daughter for a good five minutes when I put her in this for the first time. It looks pretty comical on, but in a cute way. She also had plenty of room to move her legs and feet around . . . kind of like a mini sleeping bag that stays put. I highly recommend this and it makes an excellent baby shower gift 
This has been a great help for our infant daughter. She's been in sleepsacks since practically birth. She stays warm and snug and can't kick it off. We only use it at night, so when it goes on, she knows it's bed time. It's part of the routine now. Highly recommended 
These are great! Our triplet girls have been wearing these sleepsacks for bedtime and naps since we brought them home from the hospital. They were so easy for sleepy parents to use during midnight diaper changes. We have gone through the newborn and small size and are about to buy the next size up because they work so well. We also don't have the constant worry about SIDS issues like we would with blankets. We highly recommend these for any new parent. 
All sizes of the SleepSack are available at BabiesRus.com. You should also try the new SleepSack swaddle if you want to swaddle your baby easily. It turns into a regular SleepSack when swaddling is no longer needed/wanted 
The Halo sleepsacks are great! The best part is that it zips from the bottom. I thought this was weird at first until I needed to change her. You just unzip to her stomach, change the diaper, and the zip back down. we had a few of the cheaper sacks and they zip from the top which always wakes our little girl up. It's totally worth spending a little extra money for these 
It really works (baby's fingers and toes used to be cold). It's a little nerdy and it smelled when we got it. But it keeps her little toes warm and it's such a relief to know that baby is safe 
WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE TO TRY OUT B/C OUR BABY WOULD KICK THE COVERS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WE LOVE FOR THE HOUSE TO BE COLD.. I WAS WORRIED B/C WHEN I WENT TO CHECK ON THE BABY, HE WAS ALWAYS FREEZING COLD. SO I WENT TO BABIES R US AND FOUND THIS... YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.... EVERYONE NEEDS AT LEAST 2 OR 3 OF THESE LITTLE OUTFITS... WE EVEN BOUGHT IT BIG SO HE WOULDN'T OUTGROW IT..!!! SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET AT LEAST ONE.. 
I bought this sleepsack for my 4 month old daughter and she totally loves it.She sleeps all night now,where as before she'd wake up at like 5 am.She gets cold easily so I still put a light blanket over her even though she's in the sleepsack,plus it gives her that added security,and me some peace of mind knowing she's not buried under a pile of blankets.But I got mine at Marshalls for $13.00,sure beats paying almost $20.00 
Looks good, seems comfortable. They're light and don't take up much space. I bought two. My kids love them over the big toddler seats they were in before 
This is a wonderful backless booster seat. Much more plush than most you find for sale. Light weight, comfy, and nice fun color. My daughter loves it 
Avent nipples have been wonderful for my baby. I did not experience nipple confusion when I started my son on bottles and I am still breastfeeding. I am very happy with there products and would recommend them to everyone 
This is an excellent nipple that mimics the breast when brest feeding is not feasible 
I love this jumper. I first used it at "Grandma's" house and I was amazed at how long it entertained my then 4month old for. So when I got home a week later, I ordered a different one from toys r us. It had all of the gizmos and gadgets and I just knew she would love it. But she couldn't even jump in it because of the placement of the leg holes in the seat. So I returned it and bought the Graco jumper like Grandma. The bumper around the seat is a must have. Along with the tray where we put toys and soon snacks. She was soo happy to jump again, she wouldn't let my take her out for 45 minutes! 
We bought this for our son last year for Christmas when he was 3 1/2 months old. He liked it but we had to stuff blankets in to help him sit up. We bought this over an exersaucer because we did not have room to store anything large. He has really liked it. He is now 15 months old and walking but still likes to jump in it. I put him there when I am cleaning and he has a great time 
Well she does...She jumps like a rabbit. I put a mirror in front of her so she can see herself. She get a huge kick out of this. They should get this item back in stock 
I love thi sling for many reasons but the top three are the following: 1) my baby calms down right away when she's carried in it. 2) she doesn't get scared of strangers when we visit new people or go to a party (she's in the middle of the stranger anxiety phase). 3) Most of all it helps nursing really discretely in public without ovrheating my baby. Before Itried to use all kinds of blankets and scarves but my baby was getting so swaty and hot. instead the fabric of maya wraps is very breathable and my baby remains at a comfortable temperature, even in Texas 
Both my husband and I love the sling bag. He enjoys not having to carry our big pink bag - too girly for him! Fits EVERYTHING we need. So many compartments and very comfortable. Keeps hands free and not having to keep a big bag on your shoulder! I love it - so easy for those short, quick, busy trips! ALL MY FRIENDS LOVED IT! One friend wanted one for her twins...that much room. Another friend said it would be perfect for her upcoming plane trip. A third friend said it would be a perfect Father's Day gift 
I've had the Essentials bag for about a week now, and I absolutely love it! I had a small size Eddie Bauer diaper bag, and it would constantly slip off my shoulder when I was carrying the infant carrier, which made things more difficult. Not only is this bag stylish, its functional as well. My baby is almost 6 weeks old, and I can still carry all the major necessities that fit in my other diaper bag. If you get the black gray model, Dad can use it also! This is what I currently carry in the bag: Bottle Holder - 1 4 oz. Dr. Brown bottle, can definitely fit larger bottles in the future Large Top Compartment - 3 diapers, baby wipes case, and small bottles of hand sanitizer and baby powder, disposable changing pad Middle Compartment - 2 4 oz. Dr. Browns bottles and a formula dispenser Bottom Compartment - Extra Sleeper and Shirt, my wallet, and keys Small Velcro Compartment on Strap - loose coins Cell Phone Compartment - my cell phone of course Small Zipper Compartment - Chapstick and Lipstick - there is also a nifty pen holder next to this compartmen 
I have had the pretty Petuina Pickle Bottom bag, the baby Bjorn diaper bag, and the baby sherpa bag and I have to say none of them functioned for me. For other moms I am sure those bags worked great for them but this tiny compact bag is the greatest. I wish I had this bag when my son was first born. Although it looks small it holds everything! And it gives you a chance to have your hands free without even feeling like you are wearing a bag. I am in love with this bag. It is so nice to go out and not feel like I am moving in. With my other bags they were so big and bulky and with this one it is like I don't even have it. Again it is a must have for all moms!!!! If you get the Black and Gray it is great for the dad's as well. 
I ordered the essentials bag after struggling with a bulky regular diaper bag and my newborn. The essentials bag fits a blanket for laying the baby on to change, a new outfit, at least two diapers, a wipes case, three 6 oz. bottles, a formula dispenser, my wallet, keys, pacifer, burp cloth, and cell phone. Everything has it ones compartment, which makes finding everything easy, no digging around in the middle of a big bag, and due to the design it feels much lighter than a larger bag. I have not had issues with the seams coming apart either. I also recommend the Bundle Me, by JJ Cole, it makes winter travel with babies so much easier than a snow suit 
Every since I found out I was pregnant, I've been dreading the purchase of a diaper bag. According to my friends, I carry a ridiculously small purse for a mom (I have a 12 y.o. already)--it's really just a cell phone holder with one pocket with slots for cards and another zippered pocket for cash. I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives --after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag. But, at the same time, if my memory serves me well, a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear, etc. on a daily basis even harder. So I was thrilled when I saw this bag. It came in the mail today (from another merchant) and like another poster, I've been trying it out. It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it --a few diapers, change of baby clothing, etc. And so far, it feels very comfortable. Even when worn in tandem with the PreMaxx New Edition baby carrier I also bought. I will post again once the baby arrives to give an update on this product 
Love this bag and so does my girlfriend who wanted to steal mine at first. It fits most of the essentials to go out for the day to the mall or to run errands. It even fits my wideneck bottles and wallet. There is not enough room for change of clothes, changing pad, or toys but that's what the bottom of the stroller is for. It is very comfortable to wear even over a jacket and does not hurt your back to carry it. And it's never in the way of maneuvering your way through the aisles. 
For the size and shape, this bag holds more than you would think! I also love that your hands are free when you wear it and that your cell phone is easily accessible. We bought it for our first plane trip with our 3 month old and have used it back home more than our other bags. My only complaint is that there isn't a pocket big enough to hold a fold-up changing pad... but I can fit in the disposable ones 
This Bag will hold about five diapers. It is also male friendly as it does not look like a traditional diaper bag. This one is good for short trips. 
Mommy and baby enjoy this purchase very much. It is very well made, good materials and the stitching and sewing will make the blaket very durable for a lon long time. The colors are bright and cheerful 
I got this comforter for my babyshower. When i registered for it, i thought it was kinda cute, but when it came I really fell in love wtih it!!! The colors, the feel, just darling. &lt;br /&gt; I recommend this set for everyone, who is looking for a neutral set with wonderful colors.&lt;br /&gt; 
I ordered the Safari comforter, dust ruffle, sheets (yellow and green!), rugs, fleece blankets with animals in the corners, and bumper pads for my boys' room - and it is all so cute!!! It is restful and fun at the same time. I love that you can order only the parts the you need. Only one of my boys needed bumper pads, but both needed everything else. I had a hard time finding a place where I could get a comforter and dust ruffle without the bumper pads. I prefer the yellow sheets over the lime green. We have lots of guests, and everyone comments on how cute the boys' room is, but even better is that the boys love it 
Overall, I've been very impressed so far with this nursery collection. Specifically, I like the quality of the quilting work done -- which, to be honest, I wasn't expecting after just viewing the web picture. Since we live in a warm climate, I decided to use the comforter as a wall hanging above the crib. It looks very lovely, brightens up the room, and shows off all the embroidery on the comforter. Anyway... whether you use this quilt as a blanket or art, I think you get your money's worth 
I have bought the crib dust ruffle and mobile so far and plan to buy several other pieces. This set is so cute. Our nursery is a Noah's Ark theme and this set is perfect. The quality is great. I have seen similar sets elsewhere for a LOT more money. If you are thinking about purchasing this, I say Go for it! I am known for being picky about getting the best for my money and I am not at all dissappointed with these pieces 
I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one...I highly recommend this set to everyone.. 
I am extremely happy with this product. I am disappointed that the line is disappearing off the internet fast though... when I first ordered this there was a diaper keeper which I planned on getting if I liked the pattern, but it isn't available now :(  I highly recommend this blanket and the entire collection 
I ordered this pattern for a friend of mine who is having a baby shower the end of september. I had no problem receiving my merchandise and I love the quality and the colors of this item. I bought her the comforter, the bed ruffle, and the bumper and target was right on target delivering it to my home. This is the first time I have ordered oline from target and I am very happy with the shipping of my 3 items (that came all at the same time within 3 days) and the quality of this item. Thank you target! Sincerely, ROBIN C 
I love this set. I looked high and low for neutral, bright nursery bedding and decor and was prepared to spend a lot more money on a set when I stumbled across this in the store. The actual store didn't stock very much of this, but I was able to complete the set on-line and I received it all within 2 days or placing my order. I have the quilt, mobile, hamper, bedskirt, bumper, light plate, wall-hangings, valance, crib sheet, and lamp shade. The quality seems to be excellent and it's so cute. I can't wait to put the entire nursery together with these great decorations. 
We bought this carrier after owning an older one that has started to look quite ugly. I must say, this company thought of everything! There is a place for my cell phone right on the shoulder straps and the padding for the parent in the shoulder and back area is superb. I never thought I would use a canopy on this type of product but I have and it is a great feature to keep your little one dry. Great job Chicc 
I'm a first time mom, so before my daughter was born, I buy a bassinet, but babies grows so fast, and start roll over, that in 1 month it no longer fit. I buy this, and I think that is great! Low Price, practical ( you can leave anywhere) and very comfortable!!! I LOVE IT!! 
Excellent Bibs. They cover a large area, the velcro lasts forever (unlike others we've used), the pouch at the bottom is great, and saves many a spill. 
The best bibs! Pricey yes but worth it. Cute patterns too! 
We love these bibs. They wash up easily and fold up really small for easy packing. They're soft, light, and totally water proof 
This potty is perfect for keeping in the trunk of the car for emergencies on the go. The lid closes, so it fits into the trunk with no problem, and you can throw a package of wipes into it to have handy. Put a 2.5 gallon Hefty zip-close bag over the removable pot so the child can urinate right into the bag, then you can zip up the bag and toss it. Easy and clean!! There is also room to fold up 5 or 6 more bags and store them under the cover. I never go ANYWHERE without this potty for my son! The pee guard does fall off easily, but you don't really need it and I threw it away once my son could aim downward into the bowl 
I used this potty for my daughter and had no problems. She loved going on it. As with all potty training, everyone has different experiences and always will. For us, this potty was just fine. No bells and whistles which was great because my daughter had the Royal Potty and instead of concentrating on the concept she was too busy playing with the sounds. This is a basic potty and it worked perfect for us. We also placed it right next to a basket of books :-) Good Luck 
When my daughter was born I planned to strictly breasfeed her for the first month at least. However, complications from jaudice forced us to introduce the bottle on her 5th day of life. The Avent system with the Newborn Nipple allowed us to provide her with both expressed breastmilk and formula supplements with ease. Since then I've tried other bottles &amp; nipples. Nothing compares to the gentle flow of the Avent Nipple which feeds her at just the right pace to avoid gas and spitting up later. We now use nothing but 
When my baby was a newborn, I felt I didn't have enough control to safely carry her in this sling. It just seemed uncomfortable for her head - it's not like the picture of the (very THIN!?) woman with newborn - they must have proped the baby's head up to take that picture. I felt like she was getting lost in the folds. HOWEVER, now she's 6 months and I can wear her on my hip. The New Native sling is awesome - it's simple, the material is very nice and soft, I can take it on and off easily and most important - she is totally comfy, secure and entertained, watching my every move! 
I bought a cheap carseat. I got it home and could feel the plastic where the baby's butt would be. It was horribly uncomfortable. I went shopping around and come across the Comfort Sport. It's so comfortable and has tons of padding. The cover is a snap to get off and on to clean. The seat is plenty big for my child. The straps are easy to use. It's used in the middle of my Ford Explorer and my boys have plenty of room with it between them. I think this is a good seat for the price. The cheap carseats are just not worth it. I want my child to be comfortable and safe. It was easy to install. I highly recommend it 
When buying a convertable car seat for our daughter, we were looking for one that was not only safe and easy to install, but also would be extra comfortable. Both mine and my husbands families live a day's drive away, and we wanted a car seat that would be extra soft and comfortable. This one has turned out to be wonderful! Very easy to install, has the 5-point harness which is the safest way to strap a baby in, and the padding is thick and cozy. Very simple to turn it from rear-facing to forward-facing. I've noticed that I cannot loosen the straps unless I completely take it out of the car, and I'm going to have to get the manual to figure it out, but I'm sure I'll get it. (Side note: I also took this as a checked item on a flight, and the car seat made it without a scratch! 
I love this car seat! It was a present from my sister and mom. My baby is almost three months old and we have had no trouble at all out of this seat and the directions that we got with it are so easy to understand. The only complaint I can think of is that even with the pink carseat , pink blanket, and pink outfit our baby will be wearing, they still ask "Girl or boy? 
I love this seat. Its light, easy to use, and its PINK. Have you looked for a girlly carseat? Its hard to find one that looks "ok" for a girl. Can't believe I found a PINK one. I hated using the seat without the base for my other kids (4). So I purchased the extra base before I even new I "needed" it. 
This is a pretty good chair. Over all I'm happy with it, though I do not like the handle, my daughter is now 16pounds and it isnt easy to carry her with it. But for the most part, she likes the seat its a pretty pink, it fits well in the car and I'm 99% satisfie 
I bought this potty for my kids over 20 years ago and bought it again for my grandson. I must agree the plastic is not as heavy duty as it was 20 years ago but it works just as great. It is easy for the child to place on the toilet by themselves. Encourages independence. The handles are well placed for them to turn around. The step is adjustable to give your little boy the opportunity to stand and go. I think this product is fantastic 
We really like the potty trainer but the rubber feet inserts were missin 
I think this item is very good. The only problem we are having is the steps could be just a bit longer to fit our toilet better. When he goes to set down the steps come up off the floor and it gets a bit wobbly. But he really likes the idea of climbing a "ladder" and using the potty (big toilet) himself. Potty training must be one of the most challenging things to teach a child, every little thing that can make it a bit easier is great! The only thing with the steps is they really need to take off their pants/shorts before stepping up. They can not step up and get turned around with them pulled down, and the steps are not secure enough to pull down their pants once they are up there, at least my son can not do that yet without feeling like he will fall. But, if it gets him more willing to use the potty this item is doing its job IMO 
My son loves this bouncer and so do I. The bright-colored spiders slowly and slightly move up and down and are just the right size and colors to keep his attention and keep him busy "talking/singing" with them. The toy bar is perfectly positioned for the baby to kick and/or grab the toys and it is removable for easy in-and-out with the baby. The music is quite pleasant so I usually keep it running all the while it is keeping my baby busy. This bouncer definitely does me the favor of allowing me to get things done while keeping my baby happy. I highly recommend this product 
These fit on all baby bottles that are not wide-neck, so I bought a couple packs to have extra lids for breast milk storage, formula mixing, and travel. These work so much better than the two-piece lids to prevent leaks. And my Medela bottle lids cracked, so I used these as a replacement. None of these sturdy lids have cracked 
Having played the non-electronic version, this upgrade does help game play move more smoothly. There are a few drawbacks however. It's easy to accidently reset the game by pressing the wrong button, and since teams are designated #1 and #2 on the controller AND the controller travels around the room, it's easy to get confused and give points to the other team by mistake. This happens a lot, especially if you're playing with a group who has not played recently or are not familiar with the game. The fact that there are no multiple parts is a big plus. This is a very good group word game once everyone gets into the groove 
... I plowed relentlessly thru virtually all of the cards in the original set. We even considered making our own playing cards, so satisfying is the game. So we were all thrilled to discover that there was an electronic version. 'Catch Phrase'is fast paced, easy to learn and play, and the game setup, with discrete categories, while not to my personal liking, offers a bit of variation. The only glytch is the scoring feature, which does not allow for mistakes, but this is a small quirk. .. 
This game is extremely fun. I have played it with multiple groups of different people and the game is requested every time. In fact, the worst thing about this game is that it is addictive! People who are wanting to head home for the party early find themselves staying for "just one more round" over and over. I have also played the non-electronic catch phrase and it is fun as well. It's also cheaper. Either way, this game rocks. It is along the same lines as Taboo, just more fun. I highly recommend this game 
We recently used this with my 26 month old son on his Britax Marathon. It was so simple. With my husband's help, we were able to attach it to the carry-on while my son remained sleeping in his seat. My son is a real busy body and hates strollers, so I worried that he would not want to sit in it during our layover after being stuck in a plane for 4 hours, but he loved it. He actually couldn't wait to sit in it and be wheeled through the airport. Once we got to our final destination, he actually threw a fit because we would not take the seat out of the car and wheel him inside the house 
I was quite skeptical when this small strap arrived in the mail because it looked so simple. But it worked very well and was a real life-saver. It was affordable and easy to use. I recently traveled alone with my 13-month old and didn't want to bring my stroller. I simply used the Traveling Toddler to attach our Britax Marathon car seat to my carry-on suitcase. It allowed me to "wheel" my son through the airport by myself, while carrying all of the stuff I needed to carry. I had a backpack as a diaper bag, and I was good to go! So simple I even had a hand free. I couldn't believe it. A flight attendant helped with the seat once I was on the plane. The only drawback was going through security and having to un-do and then re-do everything. But once you have the straps adjusted to the right tightness, it's easy to put back on without having to readjust the straps. 
This product is really wonderful when traveling by airplane. It just hooks to your carry on luggage on wheels and the child sits right in it as you stroll through the airport. So many people made comments about it as I walked through airports while traveling. They thought it was the neatest thing. I was 6 months pregnant when I first used it and it was great to not have to lug a big stroller around and I had less things to take with me. I gave it 4 stars only because it does take a short time to hook/unhook it every time you get on or off the plane. I had to pull to the side and keep my daughter with me while I hooked the seat back on to the luggage. But other then that it is one piece of nylon and not a huge stroller and I will take that anyday 
I traveled this summer with my 18 month old. I planned to take our car seat since we were renting a car when we landed. I had a layover each way, so I was looking for a way to move him through the airport with little fuss since airlines have strict stroller policies. So, I found the Traveling Toddler and thought I would try it. It was awesome and so affordable! It was easy to use, even when I had to unhook it for security and when boarding the plane. My toddler (who was nearly 30lbs at the time) loved riding through the airport and loved the security of sitting in his car seat. Make sure your luggage has a locking extension handle so that you can push or pull your toddler. A great product! I have recommended it to many. 
We purchased this to travel over the summer and it is great! I researched many options and, not only was this the most economical, it was the easiest and most efficient. It is very easy and quick to use and very small to store when not in use. Plus, my daughter loved it because it allowed her to travel in her own seat where she is very comfortable. Not only did we love it, I had three different people stop me in DFW and Denver international airports asking where I got it because they wanted one too 
We have one Eddie Bower seat and this Britax Roundabout. It was well worth the extra cost for the Roundabout. We knew Britax Car Seats got great ratings, but we wish someone had told us how much better they are than the other seats. It's a huge difference. We're considering throwing out the other car seat and getting a second Roundabout. Bottom line: it's easy to use and super comfortable for our son. 
awesome product, well worth the money. The only car seat I will ever buy again!! Comfortable, attractive and withstands wear and tear of kids 
This carseat is the absolute best. I purchased this seat when my daughter outgrew her infant seat and my only regret is that I didn't buy this seat from the very beginning. It is comfortable and easy to use. I looked at other Britax models but didn't find those as easy to use. Do yourself a favor and invest in this seat 
I bought this car seat for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She is now 2 years old and it is still in perfect condition. The straps NEVER get tangled. It is also so easy to adjust the straps. Everything about this car seat is amazing. My mother in law has a Cosco and I HATE it. Spend the extra money it is worth it. 
after debating about spending the $$ on this seat, i purchased this and 2 others to try in our small SUV. (we have a land rover freelander.) the others were bulky and harder to install. this was by far the best of the 3 i bought. (i returned the other 2!) not only is it comfortable for my baby, who has so far used it from 3 months to 9 months old and it still looks brand new... but it also is easy for me to put her in. the straps don't twist and i love the velcro that holds the straps to the side as i put in/take her out. this model also rated the highest in consumer reports crash tests!! my daughter will use this one til we have another baby that needs it, then i will buy a big girl Britax seat for her 
After searching for just the right seat, I'm happy to say I love this one. The instalition was so easy. I have an Acura and I was afraid it wouldn't fit well into the car rear facing, but it fits very well. With room to spare. I would highly recomend this seat. 
I found this car seat to be much easier to use and instal than the other car seats we have used (COSCO's Alpha Omega Elite Convertable. My daughter is large for her age and it was nice that we were able to keep her seat in the rear facing position until she was one year old. If you have a big baby (over 9lb at birth) this is your seat. 
We are extremely happy with this carseat. We saw no need for an infant/detachable since we use a sling to carry our baby. One note though: If you plan on using this seat for a newborn, make sure your purchase separate head support. Our baby was small, and for awhile even having double headsupport wasn't enough to keep her head from falling forward. We just tucked a folded blanket under her chin to help give her support. One major bonus, she's very comfortable in this seat. When she went through her fussy, oops I mean high need ;) period, just sitting her in this seat (not even driving anywhere) calmed her instantly! We love the fact that this is the only carseat we'll need to buy. When you take that into consideration, not having to buy an infant and then another carseat later, the price is not bad at all. Britax= quality safety 
I really like the suction bowls. The different sizes and lids are great. my only complaint is that the bowls often come un stuck so every few minutes you have to reach over and push them back down 
Since our bedrooms are upstairs it is really convenient to have this product right in the same room. There's no need to go downstairs and leave the baby crying until you get her bottle ready. It takes some time using it to get used to the right temperature since the amount of water it states to use in order to heat up the bottle sometimes does not warm the bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much. I don't go by the amount of water stated to use for each bottle size. Regardless of the size of the bottle or the amount of milk in it past 4 ozs, I fill the vial with water up to 9-10 and push the button. From time to time I take the bottle out and check the temp. Once it is the way I want it to be, I just take it out, shake it, and feed the baby, letting the rest of the water evaporate on its own. This way I know I will always have a warm bottle since once it is turned on and shuts off, you have to wait 10 minutes to warm it up again. Who has the time and patience with a crying baby to tend to? Overall, it is a great idea and has saved me many trips to the kitchen 
I bought this product for the arrival of my second child. I bottle fed my first child as well. This product is a timesaver/lifesaver! I only wish I had it 4 years ago with my first child. The key is to read the directions carefully before using this product. If you use more than the recommended measurement of water for the warmer you will scald the bottle and formula and it won't cool down easily either. As long as you read the instructions and follow them, this product is a wonder and joy to use. The cooler is especially nice because it cuts down on the nighttime feeding process, but you must take special care not to chill bottles longer than the recommended 8 hrs. You'll love the convenience and peace of mind! If I only knew then what I know now... : 
After having a potty seat that you take on off the toilet, we finally tried this Potty Pal seat. My almost 4yr old daughter can easily take the proper seat down to go to the bathroom. The childs adult seat is light will not come slamming down. They all fit in the seat cover nicely is not akward as an adult to use. Highly recommend wish I would have bought this after she outgrew the stand alone potty seat 
Can I just tell you how much easier my life has been since I got the Potty Pal? What a hassel it was to have to put the removable seat on in a rush and take it off ten times a day. And when company came over . . . Aggghhh. Now it is as easy as flipping up the lid. My daughter doesn't have accidents standing in front of the potty waiting for me to adjust the seat. My guest aren't faced with that awkward situation of what to do with the potty seat when they need to use the toilet. Thank you Potty Pal! 
We call him Seizure Dog because the color scheme is, frankly, almost nauseating to grown-up eyes. But babies react to this little guy like no other toy I've seen. It was really the first thing that my daughter ever responded to outside of food and people. She used to fall asleep holding some part of Seizure Dog's anatomy and would wake up playing with one of the various dangly bits. The high-contrast and bright primary color scheme really draws infants' eyes, especially from generally (and appropriately!) sedate and relaxing nurseries. We now buy Seizure Dogs for all of our friends with babies. The next one we get will be the 6th one of these we've purchased, so I'd have to say we highly recommend it 
We have had this toy since my son was 3 weeks old...he is almost 7 months now, and he has loved it all along. It still looks great and still barks, when we travel we are always sure to take "red" Thomas' favorite toy! It has lots of 'chewable' pieces and it attatches to almost all of his travel gear 
I have had Pupsqueak attached to the carseat since my son was born. He is now 7 months and loves him more everyday. He holds him and plays with him on every car ride. This toy is a great value for your money and a wonderful, colorful, durable and captivating playmate for baby 
Right around the age of three months, my daughter started to really become interested in the things around her, and Pupsqueak was no exception! She absolutely loves this toy and we take it everywhere we go. I can lay her on the floor with this and she will move it back and forth, grab at it, and pull the ring into her mouth. She absolutely loves the sound the ears make. A great toy to teach your child grasping 
My 4 month old daughter loves this toy. The bright colors and textures are great. The pupsqueak keeps her busy. One of the best toys we have purchased 
My 4 month old has enjoyed her Pupsqueak for a month now. She can lay in her bassinet up to an half hour staring at her new buddy. The bright colors and textures seem to facinate her. The puppy's ears contain that "noisy" paper, but that's ok. Sometime's that's how I know that she's awake via the child monitor. She isn't old enough to press his nose make him bark, but I'm sure once she's old enough she'll enjoy that feature too. I highly recommend this product 
Our little girl has loved this toy from the moment we purchased it when she was 4 months old and able to sit in her stroller by herself. She is now almost 8 months and is still discovering new things to do with it. It has held up well and she hears the laughing &amp; ribbits just fine - she thinks they are hilarious 
I don't know who likes this toy more, my baby or my husband and I. This is an awesome invention with lots of gadgets and toys to keep baby occupied. Fits really nicely with a Graco Quattro Tour stroller and doesn't have to be removed when the stroller is collapsed. This will be on my gift giving list for any baby I have to purchase for 
I looked into these bottles because I was going on a camping trip and wanted to make life easier on me. I was using the Dr. Brown bottles but they are such a pain to clean especially if your camping. I read some reviews on these bottles and heard they were better then the Dr. Brown bottles so I tried them out. my son was still spitting up a little with the Dr. Brown bottles but now he dosen't spit up at all! I am sold on these bottles. I would say the liners are kind of a pain only because you have to buy extra and you have to make sure you have extra in your diaper bag. But it is worth the change in my son! 
I have used these bottles to supplement nursing for the last eight months. Since the liners are steralized, all I have to do is wash the nipples and other parts in very hot water and let dry. These are convenient and easy to use. Try the rubber nipples as well as the bottle series with the solid color tops that close down on the nipple - I like those the best because they are so compact. 
I never wanted to use this bottle, but a friend of mine gave them to me and i gave them a try.(we were using avent... my daughter had very bad gas with avent) I fell in love bought a million drop ins and now at 6 months old i need to stop using them. while i was driving my daughter learned how to squrit the milk all over the car. great bottle for gas bad bottle for car.: 
This bottle system is wonderful. The liners are so easy to use and they're even better for keeping everything clean and sterile. They're wonderful! My baby goes between bottles and being nursed and she has no problem at all 
After trying the Avent bottles and my newborn hating them, a friend recommened the Playtex Nurser. My daughter has done very well with them from 2 weeks old to 7 months old. The soft nipples are more like breastfeeding. 
While we were preparing for the arrival of our daughter, we were hoping to use these bottles because of the convenience, so when our pediatrician recommended them, the decision was made. These bottles are wonderful!!! They don't have to be scrubbed inside with a brush like one-piece bottles. We just throw them in the dishwasher and they're done. Our daughter has reflux, and the silicone slow-flow natural latch nipples work well for her. Our doctor (along with other doctors in the same group) says that these are the best bottles to cut down on gas. I would highly recommend buying the premium nursers (featured here) instead of the older original nursers that are slowly being phased out. (We have some of each.) The premium lids are a MAJOR improvement-they're easy to pop on and off one-handed, unlike the original lids that you have to pry off with your fingernails. You can interchange all the parts from both systems (use any holder with any ring with any nipple with any lid), but I think the premiums are much better. Also, the premiums come with the silicone nipples, but the originals usually don't. The liners for these nursers are very inexpensive, especially if you use the coupons that come with the bottles or if you buy the store brand liners (they work just as well). The only downside to this system is that there isn't much room at the top of the liner to put in a full 4 ounces of water plus powdered formula and shake. But that problem can happen with any bottle, and I don't think it's a big deal. GOOD NEWS for those who use these bottles! I just discovered today that you can buy extra rings and lids on www.teebop.com. (I got the info. from Playtex over the phone.) I plan to get some extra premium lids to take the place of the few original nurser system lids that I have (and to make up for the ones I will inevitably lose along the way). 
I used this for my daughter starting when she was only a few weeks old, and she loved it! She would just lay there and look at all of the colors. Later on, it really helped with her hand-eye coordination as she tried to hit the toys or grab them. The bars unsnap easily to put the pad in the washing machine, and the toys are easy to rotate. It's also easy to travel with, the bag it comes in is durable enough to use as a storage case, which helps keep it clean. This would be a great gift for a baby shower 
This entertained my daughter for 2 hours of the day. Make sure to buy extra hanging toys. It comes with 3 hanging toys. A musical toy, a bell ringing mirror and a rattler is your childs starter kit. It had my daughter reaching and rolling for the first time plus focusing great. The colors and characters had her talking and kissing them 
This little gym kept my daughter busy exploring, touching, feeling, and hearing new sounds. I would highly reccomend, in fact I bought it for all my friens who were expecting 
My 4 month old was losing interest in this toy until I purchased 4 new things to add on and now he loves it again. The nice thing is that you can keep changing and adding toys as interest fades. I think this will still be fun for a toddler to climb under the arches as a sort of obstacle course type play. The durability of this product is excellent too. I have not been able to keep my 6 and 8 year old children out of it! The 10 year old thinks it's pretty neat too. Not only do all of the children use it, but 2 dogs love to climb all over it as well. Durable and entertaining 
The Gymini is wonderful! I have used it since the day I brought my son home from the hospital. It helps a baby to develop focus and tracking skills and increases alertness in the first couple months. It then helps with hand eye coordination. You can dangle an assortment of toys from the arches. We never purchased any of the extra ones you can get because I'd just add some of his other toys with the clip-ons you'd use with a stroller. It is hard to find an educational toy for a newborn that can be interactive as well and last! This fits the bill. You can lie on the floor and talk to them about what they are looking at..sometimes my baby is just happy to have his playtime and can play independantly for about 20-30 minutes. It is portable. We have folded it up and taken it in a suitcase with us 5 times now! Because it is so lightweight and folds up easily it is great for travelling. Then you can set it up in your hotel room or at grandma's house and baby is in a familiar environment to play in which gives you some hands free time and baby some fun as well. It has amazed me how much older children play with it to! Thanksgiving and Christmas at Grandma's all the nieces/nephews from ages 4 to 14 were playing with it on their own and with the baby. Now at 4 months I think my son gets a little bored with it because he likes to be sitting up. Yet he will still play with it for a good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me on this, if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea in the morning while it is still hot this is a good thing!). I tend to rotate his toys now so I think this will still bring entertainment for up to a year. Toddlers we have had over like to crawl under the arches and past the dangling toys.. 
If there is one thing you are going to buy for your baby - buy this! Both my children went under it from newborn. The toys were fascinating for them to watch and the mat is nice and soft to lay on. As they grew they would bat the toys to make them swing and grab them to pull a leg or tail into their mouths for chewing. They learned to make the noises that each toy makes. The arches are soft and bendable so when they are rolling around they move with the baby so there is no risk of getting caught up in an odd position. It's portable, just folds in half, so you can take it with you. It washes up extremely well. It's just a great toy! 
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!!! She plays with it for at least 30mins Which is time that I can get things done. I work 4 days a week and brought this to daycare and she plays with it all the time. I highly recommend this produc 
These cups are great. I bought them for the 2 year old I babysit. 3 months later, and they're still in great shape. The graphic on the front is starting to wear a little bit, but that's not really a concern of mine. They don't leak, which is great 
My 2 year old loved this cup, before he wouldnt drink out of a sippee cup only a prober glass but would alway spill it. This cup is so bright he cant help but look at the items and tell me about whos in it, it helps also being bright I never lose it. I hope this cup last over to be used by his brother. The wide top makes it feel different than a reg cup. I am buying more oif these 
GIVING THIS ONLY FIVE STARS IS AN INSULT!! IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH! THANK GOD FOR THE SECURE-ME TRAVEL SEAT!! MY LIFE IS FOREVER CHANGED!!! FIRST OF ALL IT TAKES ONLY 5 SECONDS TO SET THIS UP IN A SHOPPING CART. I HAD MY "SQUIRMY" 9 MONTH OLD BABY IN ONE ARM AND MY HUGE DIAPER BAG IN THE OTHER AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF "HOW IN THE WORLD AM GOING TO DO THIS"? BUT, LOW AND BEHOLD 5 SECONDS LATER IT WAS IN, SHE WAS IN AND WE WERE READY TO STROLL THE AISLES. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST $14.99 I HAVE EVER SPENT IN MY LIFE! IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER BRAND YOU ARE JUST CRAZY!! 
This is a great item -- register for it -- you will need it as soon as your child is out of the infant carrier car seat! which my daughter was out of already at 4 mths (she's very long and outgrew the height requirement). The secure me travle seat works great -- it is easily adjustable and works in many situations (regular chairs, restaurant high chairs, carts, etc. 
Started using when he was 5.5 mos sitting with help. The wrap-around-belt that secures baby even helped him sit up in a cart kept him secure from sliding or tilting! Now it's even more useful at 7 mos as he reaches for EVERYTHING. The wide strap really holds baby secure keeps them from leaning over grabbing things. I hook toys to the strap with 'links' and his pacifier with a clip he is good-to-go for even an hour+ in a store. I liked the look of the "other" kind that covers the whole basket - but this one is less bulky has the wide strap for keeping him where I want him! Update at 1yr of age: I ended up buying one of the other types of cart-protectors. The other one was great until a few months ago, when baby just can't be kept still in the cart leans or pulls feet up. So the other kind became easier as he never hits his head on any part of the cart and also it can be used in restaurant high-chairs 
This is a must have for moms who like to keep their kids secure in a shopping cart, as well as clean from yucky germs. My son is small for his age and the regular strap in the shopping cart doesn't fit around him corrrectly...he is 2 and we still use it. I tried the big cart cover that covers the entire seat and he just swam in it...this keeps him secure and safe. As well as away form the germy, yucky cart handle. I also like that this fits in my diaper bag better than the big full cover cart cover. A must have by far!!! 
Yes, I bought this so I could hear my new Black Lab puppy at night on the first floor. This thing works great, he whines I come down let him out and everyone is happy! The night-light is a great addition, my daughter-in-law says she likes mine better than hers and she paid more. Great Product! D. Michael - Bowie, MD US 
We used this gate to separate a large room into two sections to keep the little ones out of the big kids' activities. For the price it was really worth it to us. Basically now we have two rooms instead of one, minus the scary paranoia that babies may choke on the small part toys. We've had it for 6 months, it is still perfectly intact and looks superb. Since we are APO (overseas US address) the shipping is always very tricky. Usually companies charge huge rates and ship it slow boat making tremendous profits alone on the shipment. This company, the Pegasus Shop/Safe baby Shop did exactly the opposite: small shipping cost and ultra fast shipment. We got it just in a few days to our surprise. Since then I had to deal with the business with other inquiries and they are wonderfully honest and helpful. 100% satisfied 
This was our third baby monitor. We bought this one as a backup at Grandma's house and we ended up liking it so much better than the ones we had bought at double (quadruple) the price! The night light is wonderful and the sound is good. 
Easy to install and covers the outlet entirely. Other safety faceplates I tried never covered the outlet completely and my son could stick a straightened paper clip through. Not this one! They are very easy to use for an adult as well. : 
I've had this pump for about 5 months and I use it before I go to work in the morning, twice at work, and once when I get home. I was a little concerned at first because for such an expensive pump the motor only has a 90 day warranty. I plan to keep my daughter on breastmilk until she's at least one and wanted a pump that would last. I tried one of the Avent manual pumps, but I had to be engorged before I would get a few ounces out of one side (nothing out of the other). The Medela pump is so much easier and does all the work for you. The pump has held up so far and I'm really happy with it. I bought extra shields and bottles to pack with me to take to work, and keep the rest at home. The only downside I saw to these bottles is that they are made to fit only with Medela products. Otherwise, the pump is great and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something durable and easy to use 
I've been using this pump every day for 4 months, and I'm absolutely satisfied with it. Since my son was premature I had to pump exclusively in the beginning, and I can say without reservation that this pump works just as well, and quickly, as the hospital pump. It empties my breasts in 10 minutes, it's easy, and it travels well. Also with certain bras (not the Medela bras, as they seem to require some type of adapter) you can pump hands free by simply hooking/securing the nursing bra cups over the breast pump cups. One last comment I will make which speaks to quality, is that I ordered extra membranes and tubing to have available "just in case," but have yet to need them as the original ones are still operational. I can - and DO - recommend this pump to all nursing moms, and if you think this one is expensive, consider two things: 1. the value of your time and convenience, and 2. the total cost after you end up replacing the cheaper one when you find that it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down 
I was debating between this and the Avent pump since I have nothing but Avent bottles. In the end, Babies R Us was sold out of the Avent and I bought the Medela backpack with an adaptor set so you can pump straight into the Avent bottles (Avent doesn't advertise this well). I'm so glad I did. The Avent doesn't have a battery pack so I don't know how you'd use it on a trip unless you don't mind standing in the middle of an airport bathroom pumping. I, myself, prefer the privacy of a stall. Also, no one can tell its a breast pump. The backpack is very stylish and I was able to fit additional items in it so that I could use it as my only carry-on. The design is very innovative which you learn the more you use. Most importantly, I can get 5 oz per breast out in less than 10 minutes so you don't feel like you're waiting forever while pumping. I'd recommend this to anybody 
Would recommend.....clean great, work well as long as they are screwed together properly 
I bought Gerber comforthold bottles and Playtex Ventair natural shape bottles ,there were stage ones. My son didnt like Gerber's nipples since the nipples are too short and he hardly get any thing. i end up buying more PLaytex bottles and threw away Gerber's nipples and use PLaytex nipples for gerber bottles as well since they fit Gerber Bottles.Another thing i like about these bottles , obviously he got less air after feeding him i didnt have to burp him like i used to with other bottles. the shape of bottles are easy to hold to me and my baby as well. NO LEAKS RECOMMENDED!!! 
I have read and re-read reviews for bottles and have found that the only way to really find the right bottle is to try them out (no wonder this is a multi-billion dollar industry). We tried Playtex Drop-Ins and were frustrated about 6 weeks in that feedings were taking an hour with the Slow nipples. The Fast nipples drenched our son in formula. We moved to Avent with a Stage 2 nipple and found ourselves in the 50% of people who can't get them shut properly. Loved the nipple shape and speed, couldn't deal with the leaking. We tried Playtex Ventaire. Although this bottle claims to not let air in through the nipple, we apparently couldn't get these closed correctly either. Air entered through the nipple at every feeding and caused gas and spit-up problems. We eventually made our way back to the Drop-Ins, our son now old enough to handle the Fast nipple, we like these the best. I still feel reviews are beneficial, but know that your kid will let you know if he or she needs a change. Find what works for you and go with it. I give the Drop-Ins 4 stars. If Playtex would put out a Medium flow nipple, it would be 5 
I have tried many bottles for my daughter. She originally used the nurser bottles for supplementation while I was breastfeeding(low supply). They told me to pump so I got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles to pump into so she could drink directly out of. She started having all kinds of stomach upset. We then tried the Dr. Browns bottles. They were good but she had trouble with the nipple. We switched to the wide neck Dr. Brown bottles, which she did better with, but still didn't like the nipple. Finally I got back out the playtex nursers. Upset stomach problem got better. She still has reflux, I think always will, but the gas is only occasional now. Don't waste your time or money with other bottles. Easier to clean too. You can't microwave these liners, but what I do is mix up a days worth of formula in a pitcher that I keep in the fridge and pour into the liner just before ready to feed, I then put the liner with the formula in a glass of hot tap water. It only takes a minute or two to warm up. Then drop the liner in the bottle and you're ready to feed. My favorite nurser bottles are ez feed with the slider to get the air out. They are sometimes hard to find but are really easy to use. One comes in the newborn set or you can purchase them individually at BabiesRUs or Publix Grocery store. If there were more than 5 stars these bottles would get a higher rating. Can't say enough good things about them. Also easy to travel with 
Calvin tried 6 other bottle systems - including the Dr. Browns, and the drop-ins with the latex nipple were the only one he accepted. Introducing the bottle can tough for breast-fed babies, and this one seemed more natural than the others. I can't stop bzzing about how good they are. Hope this helps you on your bottle selection, Amyco 
I bought these bottles when I knew my son would have to be away from me and need to get breast milk by bottle. He had no problems going from my nipple to these and I liked that you could get all the air out of the bottle. Now that my son is on formula I do find it difficult to prepare it in these bottles. It is almost easier to put it in a seperate cup and mix the water and formula. It can be done it the bottle but it is a little difficult to mix it well. I have now mastered how to put the formula in and how long to shake it but it took some practice to get it right without the formula clumping a lot. Warming the bottles is also a problem since you cannot microwave the liners (or so it says) my mother did it once without realizing you aren't supposed to and nothing bad happened but since it advises against it, I wouldn't recommended trying it out. Now that my son doesn't really care for warm milk it isn't an issue anymore anyway. I still love these bottles and the fact that if I have enough nipples to change out, I don't have to worry about having a "clean" bottle on hand since I can just drop in a new liner. I currently have about 6 extra nipples in case this happens but it hasn't yet but it is nice to know that the option is there for us. 
I had my first baby in 2004, and being a new mom spent tons of money on the cute little bottles with pictures and designs on them only to come to realise that they gave my daughter the worst gas ever. I switched to the playtex bottles right away, and didn't have any trouble after that! My second baby came in 2005 and being in denial, tried the cutsie bottles again thinking maybe it was just my daughter. Sure enough tummy ache, and lots of gas! Playtex bottles came back into our home right away, and never had another problem. I just couldn't believe that they worked so wonderful. They are so much easier to wash, being the pre-sterilized liners just pop right in, and the larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples that some bottles have. My sister in law had her first baby in November, and I swore to her that they worked like a charm. I bought her tons for her baby shower, and she started on them, mixed with the breast, and was also amazed that they worked miracles! I would guarentee positive results to anyone who asked, and wouldn't recommend anything else. Those cute bottles may be calling, but itn't worth your little one in alot of pain and discomfort 
i hate having to wash bottles every night and these are a great time saver! Just throw out the liner and you only have to wash the nipples. Baby just loves them and so does hubby he does like to wash bottles either and he likes how once you push the air out baby can feed in any position as long as there is suction. i don't premix because you can't put them in the microwave but we have a bottle warmer so it works just as well. put the powder in the bottle first before the water or it won't mix as wel 
Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies. My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only. My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean). You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost. Another bonus is there is less clean up. Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding 
I love these bottles and so does my son. They really do keep the gas out. And the nipple is great when you are also breastfeeding, my son didnt seem to notice the difference. The only problem though, is the measuring... I'm fine now that my son drinks regular milk, but when I had to mix formula it was hard. You can actually only mix 6 oz. of formula in the 8 oz. bottles. What I ended up doing towards the end when my son was beginning to drink 8 oz., was mix the formula in another container or bottle and then transfer it to the playtex. Other than that its great not having to wash bottles over and over 
I live in Northern GA and when I got pregnant I lived in Southern LA, never thinking I would need something heavier than a blanket for my infant son. After the first morning of scraping the frost off the front of my car with my 4 month old son waiting patiently inside the house for the car to warm up, I realized that I was wrong. I have the Graco Windsor Snugride travel system, so I ordered the Celadon Bundle Me, thinking that the two greens would match. It is not a perfect match, so I probably should have ordered the graphite instead, but as far as the product goes, my son loves it. I even unzip the top cover and use it as a mat when we play at friends' houses or when we visit family as a top cover in his Pack and Play. My son likes to snuggle down into the Bundle Me and I like that I can just unzip part of it while we're driving if he starts to get hot. I definitely suggest this for anyone who lives in a somewhat chilly area. I will probably invest in the Lite version once spring arrives; anything so my son doesn't have to get bulked up with a sweater or jacket just to be comfortable in the weather 
My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train. He's about 27 pounds age 21 months. Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you're good. (Wear gloves and wash your hands after too.) Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue 
Although I am a die hard Baby Bjorn fan, I am not a true fan of the LITTLE potty. It's small in design, with no removable bowl which makes it very hard to keep clean. Save your money and upgrade to the Baby Bjorn regular potty which is well worth the money!! We keep our little potty in the minivan for those unexpected road trip emergencies. 
I had not heard about this product/brand until my 5th baby was born. We are doing "elimination communication" with him this potty works well for his first potty. Currently (he is almost 4 mo.old) we set the potty on the changing table hold him. For safety reasons, we never let go of him while sitting there. When he can sit up on his own, we will sit the potty on the floor. Eventually he will out grow it. We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer, eventually he'll use that next. In the meantime the next older child is able to use it. I like that this potty is all in 1 piece. So easy to clean (no crevises to worry about). We dump the contents into the toilet. Add a little water, to the potty, from the sink (the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water) dump rinse water into toilet. The size is nice for storing...it won't take up a lot of room. The size is nice because (eventually when he is older) he'll be able to get on off it easily himself. I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue...but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option (After an additional item was purchased with my order, I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon). The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from. I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area. We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store. Then we would have also paid sales tax our costs to drive there. I was pleased with this purchase through Amazon 
This potty has been great for my daughter. She started using it when she was 15 months old (3 months ago) and seems comfortable on it. I love the simple design and ease of cleaning. I also love that my daughter will use it! The only problem we have faced with this potty is sliding. Our daughter cannot sit on it without help because there is no traction on the bottom of it. We've tried various methods to fix this and it's not much of an issue now 
I bought this toilet when my son was less than 2 when I was tired of all of the typical childrens toilets. The potty was perfect because of how portable it is, my son could have it near at all times. The biggest problem is how small the potty is, even for my son it was somewhat tiny. He outgrew it very within 6 months but I feel that for $10 it was well worth it. It served the purpose I needed for the time 
I love this little potty for car trips. My 3 year old is petrified of automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair to use on a recent vacation. She loves it. It is really easy to clean. I just keep some clorox wipes in the car with the seat. It now lives in the back of my minivan incase of an emergency potty stop. We are also using a second one to train our 23 month old son. The splash guard is great and he is very comfortable on the seat 
BabyBjorn did it again. Small and portable, easy to clean. Great to take when you leave the house, so your child doesn't have to sit on not so clean public toilet seat.. 
I thought the monitor worked really well. I picked this one out because I loved the glow light feature. It is so much better to use the low light during nighttime feedings....but the light bulb in the receiver is not replaceable :( I have only used it for 6months and it burned out on me already. It goes off after 15 minutes and the directions say it is long lasting. Well, not long enough and I am contacting the comopany for the warranty. hopefully they will fix it 
I think that overall this booster is great. It is lightweight and large enough to accommodate children as they grow. My 3 year old son (about 30lbs) looks kind of tiny inside of the seat and he can slouch in the seat, but the seatbelt position is at a good height on small children. This seat would do well for a child who easily goes and remains in the seat...but not for a child who likes to climb out of their seat 
I bought this booster seat after considering other seats from Cosco and Britax. This one stood out for value, simplicity, safety, and convenience. At first, I considerd a convertible booster seat that also has the latch system along with 5 point seatbelts, but decided against it because my son at his age and weight (3.3 yrs, 35 lbs) does not need all these extra features in an extra bulky be-all car seat. The latch and 5 point features are intended more for a recent 3 year old, while a toddler from 3.5 years to 10 won't need it, so why bother with all this extra stuff? You don't need the added bulk and complexity for features that will only be used for .5 more years. The B510 premier is the top of the line and latest from Compass, which has more durable fabric, wider side supports, and a carry bag. My son loved it at first sight, and it works great. There is no neck support though, so you may need to buy one of these separately for long road trips. My son was literally propping his head up with his arm on the arm rest when he passed out in the car. The price of the B510 was $[...] with free shipping, and given the free carry bag which has a retail value of $[...], it makes this booster seat about $[...], which is the price of the older B500 model. The only thing I have had to get over is that booster seats in general are not secured onto the car seat with a latch, but instead, rely on the seat belt to keep my son and the seat in place. When driving around without the kids, seats like this need to be secured even if a child is not sitting in it. The base of this seat doesn't look like it'll rip into my car's leather seat, and the headrest adjusts vertically easily. I will need to buy a seat protector anyway though, since my son uses the car's seat as a step stool to get into this booster seat. Also, you will need to train your kids when they can unbuckle the seat belt because it's easily reachable. The only shocking thing to me was that this seat comes with an expiration date, and is not recommended for use after 7 years from date of manufacture. Therefore, it's not meant to be kept forever and used as a hand me down for siblings 
Muy buena adquisición. El bebé se siente cómodo y confortable 
These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms. While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow. I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one. Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one 
These are so awesome! I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets. One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night, so I put a blanket over him - well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing. Very scary. So if anything, make sure you have more than one sleep sak. 
I searched all over every store in what seemed like the world just to find a sleeping wedge for my 3-month old preemie son. He has very bad acid-reflux and sleep apnea (he forgets to breathe when he's sleeping) so he absolutely had to have one. I bought this for him and he's been sleeping trouble-free ever since. The height may only be 2-3" but it works really well, because any taller than that (I actually bought another one to try under the first one) and his poor little head will fall over and he can't breathe. We have him in a cradle and thank God I found one that fits it 
No probs with this picking up neighbors or interfering with our existing FP 900 Mhz monitor for our 2 1/2 year old. We had to trash a Safety First cheaper one and invest in this, but it's worth it and we really like it. It's clear, and we also like that it comes with two receivers. Much easier, even in our smaller home. 
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS. You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below: Pros: -You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! -Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me. -Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. -Lightweight and compact system. Cons: -The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock. -With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. -Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground. -A bit expensive. A little of both... Pros/Cons: -Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. -Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. *Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.* 
I was wondering the same thing about this stroller - i.e. how does it convert to "stand" mode? etc. I had seen the version of this stroller on the One Step Ahead website, so I called Baby Trend and they told me it is the exact same stroller. It is just marketed differently for the different vendors... and they are different colors. So, you can go to the One Step Ahead website to get more views of the stroller. I still have not purchased it yet, worried about the quality and the overall length of the stroller. But it does seem to be one of the lightest double strollers available. Good Luck 
I'm thinking about getting this stroller, but I need to know! Thanks 
I have the baby trend sit n stand from one step ahead which is basically the same as this stroller. It has rubber wheels a cup holder and few other changes. I like this stroller but I am not thrilled with the quality. The wheels don't look all that sturdy and the stroller has some play as you turn corners. Since this is our third double stroller (2 used ones before) I think this is the way double strollers are so they don't weigh a ton or cost a fortune. For the price, this is definetly the best double stroller out there. I love the hinged front tray so you can easily get a toddler out. My [...] son loves the sit n stand options and it collapses very easily. Putting the back seat on and taking it off takes a little time but not too difficult. The second sunshade is also a great option during the summer. This stroller is going to be especially wonderful at the zoo and the mall. 
Great stroller! So easy to use. It's smooth and lightweight. It fits just fine in the back of my minivan. My 3 year old loves the options to sit or to stand. My 6 month old fits nice and snug in the front. I have no complaints and have showed it to my friends, who also really like it. I compared and researched a number of strollers and am so pleased with this purchase. The parent tray could be larger, but that's my only beef with the stroller. I have back problems and I think that it's easy to manuver and steer and I don't really notice a weight difference between this and my single Peg P. stroller. LOVE IT! 
I have a 23 month old and a 6 week old and initially thought the Joovy Caboose would be the stroller for us. Thank goodness we had the opportunity to try one out before we bought it! With the Joovy, if you have an infant carrier in the front seat, there is no room at all for the older child to sit on the jump seat. Also, for some strange reason, the jump seat slides back and forth which seems very unsafe. So if you have an infant in a carrier and your older child wants to sit, the older child is out of luck. What's the point of that? With this stroller, the older child has 3 options - sit in the back seat, sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform. The back seat can be removed fairly easily and stored in the basket underneath and my little girl (who is tall for her age) has plenty of room. She sometimes dangles her feet over the foot rest but this is not an issue. Our infant carrier easily slides into the front seat and is secured with a belt. This stroller opens and closes easily and is very easy to control as it steers beautifully - it's not nearly as long as I thought it would be but both children have plenty of room. Since it has the footprint of a single stroller, it fits through doors and entranceways with no problem. It is a little heavy when folded but I don't think I would find a stroller with these features that's not. The basket is nearly impossible to get to but I can live with it. Overall, I'm thrilled with this purchase and every single time I use it, someone stops me to ask about it. One woman even said, "That's the most practical double stroller I've ever seen." I have to agree 
I keep this stocked with diapers and wipes in the back of my car, so when I go out with my daughter for short trips I don't need to worry about bringing a diaper bag. It's also great to bring to the mall, etc. and attach to the stroller 
It's a good size diapering kit. 21" by 24" and is padded. The plastic wipes case is a bonus 
We love this compact changing do-it-all kit. It's got a travel wipes box, 2 mesh pockets, one for the wipes, one for 2-3 diapers. It rolls/folds up and then velcros closed. VERY HANDY! it also has a strap that you can velcro onto your purse handle, stroller, whatever. We lost ours and I'm purchasing a new one because I just can't live without it! ha ha 
My son is now 6 1/2 months old and he loves it. He kicks away at it until he tires himself out. It is a bit heavy and you must make sure you tie it tight so that it doesn't fall or get pulled off. The sound has 2 settings, low and high. I read the review that said it was very low, i suspect it might have been on the low setting. Overall, i'd like to see a better way to secure it to crib but my son loves it 
This is great for when i need to get ready, I put her in the crib ans she kicks away. Music to your ear 
My baby does enjoy this toy. He likes to kick it and hear the music, and I like that it has 3 modes - it will just play music for 10 minutes, the baby can kick it to play songs, or it can be set to play like a keyboard when kicked. The only problem (one I see with many crib toys right now) is that it doesn't fit my crib. It has 3 ties that are meant to be attached to the spindles of a crib. The problem is most cribs now (such as mine) have solid ends, and you can't tie anything to them. This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib, and it simply won't fit. If you have a crib that has slats or spindles on the ends then you will be fine. I don't, so the only way for me to use this toy is to hold it while my baby kicks at it.Fun for him, but not for me. 
We got this as a shower gift. My daughter is two months old and already loves it! I put it on it's continous play mode and she will just sit there watching it and dancing her feet in the air! I am able to get my morning showers in because of this... now you know it's worth it just for that! haha.. 
works great and i use it often to see things and not wake up the baby. the item is a very dark orange when lit almost red. (i might try the yellow one next time. i hope it is a little lighter. 
The ordering process was easy and it was delivered in a timely manner 
I absolutely love these wall hangings - they are a great addition to the nursery! They match perfectly with the other Zanzibar products. I haven't had any problems hanging them - they came with loops on the back that worked wonderfully 
We bought these wall hangings from Babiesrus. They didn't have the hooks on the back. So we just nailed it on the wall with holes on them. Then, when I recently went to baby depot I saw the same item but it actually had the ribbons on it so that it can be easily put on the wall. Very weird! Other than that, we love it 
We love these wall hangings! They come in different textures, just like the Zanzibar bedding set. Ours came with loops for hanging, so we haven't had the problems others seem to have had. 
I love this little pouch. What a great idea rather than going though your whole diaper bag looking for the pacifier. Another great thing about this Pacifier Pod is that by the feel of this little bad (since it is connected to the outside of the diaper bag) you can tell if you have a pacifier in it so you don't leave home without one and end up needing to buy another 
I spent a lot of time researching double stollers and even test drove as many as I could and the BOB is super! It really does turn on a dime and is extremely easy to push. I have twins so getting outside for a jog/walk is crucial to keeping my sanity and shape. It is pricey, but comparitively extremely durable, easy to fold, feels a lot lighter than it appears, and I lOVE the separate sun canopies. The ride is very smooth (due to the shocks) even on bumpy terrain. 
This is the best stroller!!! We've had a single BOB Revolution for 2 years and now purchased 2007 Duallie since our second daughter was born. Our 4-month old loves sleeping in it and our two-year old enjoys the ride and comfort. Unlike most dual strollers, this one can be pushed with one finger. This stroller is not small but still fits through most doors. If you are looking for a double stroller, don't waste your money on anything else and just buy this one. 
I am on my second time around nursing and I have tried a ton of differnt pads! These ones keep my breasts feeling good. All the others seem to keep the moisture in making my breasts feel sore. These Gerber Ultra thin breast pads are the best! I will only use these. I have waisted to much money on others that only seem to cause soreness. Trust me! These are the best kind to use 
I have tried many other brands of pads and so many of them leaked and barely held any milk. I've also dealt with fuzz sticking to my nipples from one brand. I tried the medium and heavy of these and they worked great. I can wear them all night, or all day at work, and have no leaks. I used the ultra thin ones when I was leaking a little and they worked fine, although I'm sure they wouldn't work if they had to be in for very long. They are visible through clothes, but I haven't found ANY that aren't. I read reviews of so many who don't like them, but for me, they are the best that I've found. 
The Gummie Rail Guard was a good investment. My daughters crib has larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn't fit. The gummie guards will fit any size. The only problem I found is that the tape which holds them on isn't tacky enough. Don't get me wrong... they work but my daughter found an edge and started lifting off of the crib. I had some left over and put the new piece on and she hasn't bothered with it. Maybe I didn't put it on correctly the first time? Gummie saved my daughter crib from her teeth 
This is by far the nicest looking bottle drying rack I could find. I love it. I've never used the brush, though, as I use a different one. Others have mentioned their brushes breaking, so I'm not sure how it holds up. Easy to take apart and clean when needed 
I have loved having this drying rack for baby bottles and nipples. I don't have to have a soggy dishcloth on my counter anymore and it's really kind of cute 
I bought this system after experiencing frustration with other wireless monitors. For some reason this unit worked well even though I have a wireless computer network and portable phone. The flexibility is excellent since both the monitor and cameras can work with a re-chargeable power pack,batteries (monitor) or AC power (camera.) Because it worked so well we decided to import and resell them. 
Although this product isn't perfect, I really couldn't imagine traveling without it. Pros: 1. Able to have hands free (to push stroller, hold child, or other luggage)while seat is on your back like a backpack 2. Travel case folds up small and nicely - can fit under plane seat 3. Sturdy (I didn't have any issues of rips/tears like some other reviewers) Cons: 1. It can be a bit annoying trying to get the car seat in it, but it does fit 2. Strap buckle dug into my shoulders; tried to adjust it, but wasn't able to make it much better 3. The carrier flips occasionally while in the stroll mode All in all, DEFINITELY buy this product if you are traveling with a child. I don't know of a better alternative and I can't imagine being able to carry everything through the airport without it! 
This is a great product for big trips or small. Traveling alone with a toddler by plane is not easy with luggage, a stroller and a car seat. This product makes it easier. You have the option to roll it along behind you or carry it on your back freeing up your hands to push a stroller. It may take a little practice to get the car seat in at first but once you've done it it's easier every time. It also holds up to airport luggage handling coming out with a few scrapes but intact and ready to roll along. I also love that it does double duty as a sun shade for the car seat keeping it cool for your little one. I highly recommend it. 
I am really impressed with the potty protectors. First of all, they came quite quickly. Secondly, the size is pretty generous, so it fits larger toilets. I feel better about my little one using public toilets now. 
This booster seat was rated as the safest booster seat by consumer reports. Safer than any other booster seat, even the ones with backs. It is also very easy to use and to move from car to car. Highly recommend it. 
My daughter actually picked this one out, she really wanted pink. Other than that the cupholders are convenient for her "treasure" and sippy cups. Other cups we have to be careful with for fear they will spill out. Overall it functions very well and very easy to change between cars 
This is a great booster, easy to move from car to car since you don't have to strap it in. Cup holders are perfect! Good quality 
We bought this mattress for my daughter 3 years ago when she was 6 months old, and it's now on her toddler bed! It has survived uncountable jumping sessions and has been SO easy to clean - literally just a soapy spongeing does the job. It finally got a tiny split in the vinyl cover, but I put a two inch piece of duct tape over it, put on the sheet and it's back in business! When we do replace it, we'll just get another Pediatric 1000. An excellent value 
We are very happy with this mattress, but it is a little less firm than I expected. The first night that my daughter slept on it, she slept for 11 hours - so the firmness doesn't bother her 
Excellent product, fast deliver 
I have had this mattress for 3 years now. My daughter started using it as a newborn and is still using it on her toddler bed at age 3. I have had no tears or springs popping as described in another review. I guess you could buy a 200 dollar mattress for your kid, but does it really matter? Have you noticed how little kids can sleep on ANYTHING? Kids can sleep in the car with their neck bent 90 degrees to the side for 3 hours just fine. They also fall asleep on the floor without complaining. This mattress is soft and fits cribs nicely. What else do you need? Mine has held up just fine. All in all it has been a good crib matress and I would probably buy it again. If you like wasting money, you should buy a pillowtop mattress with 12,000 springs for your kid. Otherwise, just save money and buy a basic one like this. 
My 19 yr. Old daughter just gave birth on July 14th, 2005 to my grandson and I have to say the product turned out wonderfully, Jordan sleeps in his crib peacefully and and it fit directly into the crib with no extra space!! so thank you amazon!! 
This is a great product. It washes great and fits great on my contoured changing pad. It doesn't get pilly or anything. Parents--this is the one to get 
This stroller completely serves its purpose. My little girl is almost 3 and 31Lbs, I think this one is perfect for the little one who still needs a place to be when your out and about, we tried umbrella strollers (too small) and searched for too long for the perfect one, then I found it here on amazon at the best price (and I did look everywhere), I read complaints about the handles being to low and it made it uncomfortable to push, well not for me, I am 5'6 and it was just fine for me and my husband is 5'8 and we had no problems. The only drawback is the storage under it, but it is such a small price to pay, you can still put stuff there but not as much as a full size stroller. I would recommend this stroller to anyone I could who will need a transitional one, size and all 
WONDERFUL stroller! So compact, easy to fold, comfortable for my baby and toddler, easy to maneuver, great 
This is our second Combi stroller, and we like this one as much as the first, except for the clasp on the belts. We actually cut the belts off our old one and sewed it onto this one! The stroller is sturdy without being heavy, and our children love to have the bar across the front and they really like to be able to sit forward if they want to which is difficult in a regular umbrella type stroller. I have read other reviews saying that if you're tall, it's difficult to push this, I disagree. My husband is 6'1", and he finds it very comfortable to push, as does a friend who is also over 6' 
After trying just about every toddler spoon out there, we got these for our 20 month old. She gets so frustrated when the food falls off before it reaches her mouth, but with these the food stays on! Finally eating is becoming less of a battle and she is really taking an interest. Great product for self feeding 
It is very good for toddlers that are starting to learn to hold the spoon, the size and the handle are great 
this spoon is the only one that keeps my little one from getting frustrated and losing interest when self feeding. the food actually stays on the spoon long enough for him to place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down and him getting upset because of it. plus the curve of the spoon provides just the right angle for him to hold it and enter his mouth as he turns his wrist. other spoons which have a straight handle cannot do the job. it takes too long to reach their mouths and food falls right out. hooray for sassy once again! other manufacturers should follow their example on this one 
My six-month old daughter loves these spoons. The yellow and blue colors keep her interested while im feeding her. The curved shape make them easy for me to hold and then manuver it into her mouth. It's nice that two come in a pack 
While my son was still riding rear facing in the car, he would often lose his pacifier. Without a pacifier keeper, it was next to impossible to locate. I had trouble searching around the carseat because I could not see where to reach. I found this pacifier keeper useful because I always knew Spencer's pacifier was near. Now trips in the car are less stressful. He is even big enough to find it himself! I never have to worry that it has fallen on the floor of the car, either. What a great idea 
I spend a good fifteen minutes every day searching for my baby's pacifier. I hesitated getting a pacifier keeper before because I worried about the length of the cord, afraid it would choke her. However, all that lost time and wasted effort have finally gotten to me, and I have given in and purchased one. It's not as bad as I thought. The cord is not too long, and I always leave her in view where I can spot her if she gets in trouble. The keeper is "a keeper" 
I just recently bought one more changing pad for my second daughter. I have a few other of these changing pads and I like them a lot. They are nice and soft and very durable. They haven't seemed to wear out at all, the colors don't fade and the terry cloth stays soft and full. 
I love these covers. Bought several 18 months ago when my son was born and just recently purchased some other colors when my daughter was born. They last through multiple washing, don't fade, or shrink. They will have some strings that will start to unravel, but it is no different than a terry towel. Tried other covers, this one is much stronger and has significantly deeper side pockets. The colors are great too. Definately recommend 
I think I practically wore this every day for the first 6 months of my child's life. It is awesome! It is great to sit up in bed and feed because it gives you back support. The child feels very supported as well. The cover is very easy to wash. I used it for a photo prop as well and to help her sit up when she was older. My only complaint is that I did not invent it 
You only need ONE bib forever! I have a two-year-old who has only used this bib his whole life, and it's still in great condition. This bib is almost as soft as fabric but completely waterproof! I wash it in the sink w/ a scrub brush after every meal, and it is always dry by the next meal. I buy this bib for everyone I know who has a baby 
I bought a set of three of these bibs when my now 7 1/2 year old was a baby and I still have them and they still look great! I just went ahead and bought more for our new little one. You can wash and dry these and they come out looking great. I always preferred to wash them in the sink and hang dry 
This is a good car seat. I can't quite get it to be level with the ground like it is suppose to be when the base is attached, but it works the same still. Also, the clips for the buckles get turned around sometimes on the strap. That is the biggest pain I have had with this. My daughter loves it 
I am very happy with this car seat. It came very quickly even though it was around Christmas. The car seat fits well in our car as well as in our truck and our daughter seems to be very comfortable in it. 
I am totally satisfied with this carseat. It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky. My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant). There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby. I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping). But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns. My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one 
Love this seat it's nice and cozy for baby and doesn't move around when hooked in correct. The only down part is if you take it apart to wash everything be prepared to spend forever putting it back together. 
I LIKE THIS SEAT! IT WILL LAST TILL MY SON IS OUT OF A CAR SEAT. IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE (WITH THE CARS SEAT BELT)WITH THE BOSTER SEAT STILL ATTACHED, BUT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF IT WORKS JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. I HAVE NO COMPLANT EXCEPT THAT IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE IN THE CAR WITH THE CARS SEAT BELTS. I HAVEN'T TRIED THE TEATHER SYSTEM 
I shopped around to find an umbrella stroller that wouldn't break my back to push as I am 5'11" and this stroller is perfect. I found it at Target. It's so light and folds up easily which I found helpful when traveling and going through security at the airport. I would definitely reccomend this to others 
This is an excellent stroller and well worth the money. My husband and I purchased the red one from BuyBuyBaby. We intended on purchasing a similar Chicco one for about ½ the price. However, after test driving them (and other brands) in the store, the Maclaren won hands down. The handles are higher (good for tall people); it is sturdier than most other umbrella strollers; it steers well; and the canopy actually works to shade the child from both sun and rain. I would recommend purchasing the organizer that allows you to carry water and other bottles with you. It is worth the extra $20 or so. When we fold up the stroller, we just flip the organizer over the front 
I love this stroller! I bought a cheaper umbrella stroller and it was not near the stroller this is. The handles are at a comfortable height and my son sits comfortably in the stroller. The basket is perfect for a diaper bag and a couple of shopping bags. I highly recommend this stroller. It is a great investment and worth the money 
Handles are at a comfortable height. Stroller is extremely lightweight and has a convenient carrying strap. Classic design. Good for bigger, taller children (their feet won't drag on the floor). Bigger wheels equals comfort on different types of terrain. A brand I would buy again and recommend to others 
I absolutely LOVE this stoller. I bought it because I am tall and my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller was causing back pain and I kept kicking the wheels while pushing. This stroller is SO much more comfortable to push. The fabric breathes easily and my daughter doesn't complain when she has to get strapped in. The only drawback is there is no cupholder. I tried to get a generic one to attach, but then the folder wouldn't fold up. arg. All in all, totally worth the investment 
The angle of the rear wheels and the handles make walking comfortable if you're a taller parent (unlike really cheap umbrella strollers). It folds up very small, so it's easy to throw on the floor of the back seat if you don't have trunk space available. It also has a nice carrying strap so you can throw it over your shoulder like a gym bag, which was nice when I walked from my office to day care several blocks away. I always recommend this to my friends for ease of use and good value 
These shells work really well in early breastfeeding to occasionally protect sore nipples. They also work for increasing milk supply throughout the day without added pumping. I use them to collect milk on the opposite side during my nightly feedings, and have stored up a lot of milk that way. The only reason they got 4 stars is because they are kind of hard and sometimes feel kind of obvious under certain clothing. 
These were a huge help getting started on my first baby. I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad. They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple. They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples. Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups. They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse). Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace. They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting. I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage 
For my first breastfed baby these were my salvation. It helped relieve soreness while breast is in bra. It keeps the sore nipple suspended in midair and off of rubbing on your bra. It also helps the nipple stick out a little, which I found made attachment (of baby's mouth to nipple)easier as a first time breast-feeder. You do need to check the shield now and then to dump out any milk (or some may save it). The only way I see a product could improve in that area, would be to have a bottle size attachment to your boob and whom of us would really want to walk around with that? There are holes in the top of the shield to allow air circulation. For me esp. at night I would put a nursing pad over the holes so that it would help soak up any leakage. But by FAR this product is worth it. I'm due soon with baby #2 and am back to buy more. I gave mine to a mom friend who was ready to give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all the time and her breasts were unbearably sore. She swears these shields are the reason she didn't have to give up and is extremely grateful. Definitely worth the try 
These breastshells helped me during pregnancy and post. During pregnancy they helped draw out my flat, and what I know now as small nipples. Post-pregnancy they helped relieve engorgement because they exert a small amount of pressure on the areola. This helped my baby latch on better b/c the breast wasn't soooo full. (I have a lot of milk). The shells catch milk really well, and if they are sterile you can even save the milk. The other great thing about these breastshells is that they prevent sore nipples from rubbing on your bra. I'd put a little lansinoh on my nipples, then the breastshells, then the bra. Just felt better. Only precaution: Make sure you put them on with the holes on the top or else you will be soaked, and they really can't be worn outside your home. They are obvious and unattractive 
They look awful but if you have sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they are the only thing that will really fix what's wrong. The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies- you won't have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time. They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell. These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don't have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over. I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me. NOTE: don't use them to collect milk to give to your baby as one reviewer suggested. The milk collected in a breast shell is to be discarded as it states in the package instructions. 
I found them very comfotable for my sore nipples. They also collect leaking milk...but don't bend over as they will spill all over your feet (my first try). Other than this and having to wear a loose shirt to hide them, I will use them everyday instead of pads that get wet and irritate my nipples. 
great for the other car or grandma's car!! easy to use and secure! 
This is our second Combi stroller, and we like this one as much as the first, except for the clasp on the belts. We actually cut the belts off our old one and sewed it onto this one! The stroller is sturdy without being heavy, and our children love to have the bar across the front and they really like to be able to sit forward if they want to which is difficult in a regular umbrella type stroller. I have read other reviews saying that if you're tall, it's difficult to push this, I disagree. My husband is 6'1", and he finds it very comfortable to push, as does a friend who is also over 6' 
Gave as a gift to my son and his wife and they rave about it. They like it's compact size, light weight, carry strap and especially the swing out arm so their toddler can climb into it herself 
Okay, so the canopy. Well it was touching my sons head, however there is a natural bend in the metal that holds the canopy up (that slides through the canopy like a curtain rod)(where it connects to the stroller)and I took it out and put it though the other way and my son has like 2 inches between his head and the canopy. For the other people that had or will have this problem, this is an easy fix.I hope some people who already left reveiws will come back and read this. I give it 4 stars now instead of 3 on my other reveiw. My other reveiw is labeled kamarina 
I got this as a gift when my second child was born and I absolutely lvoe it! My children are a year apart and are both very comfortable in it. The ride is magnigicent! We can hit a bump and the kids don't even notice it. It provides excellent sun protection from a wonderfully deep canapee. I would recomend this to anyone who needs a double stroller. Then only drawback, and it is small is tht it is not portable. It doesn't fit in the trunk of our car. But other then that it is a great stroller! 
I decided to purchase this stroller after testing our neighbors. Our street is full of parents with babies and on Sundays the street looks like a stroller racing track. That was great for me and my wife. We were able to see and test many strollers as they all seem to be on our street and in the area. I was lucky to push some other brands that are more expensive and I must say this stroller just felt better then the other strollers we tested. This stroller is fully loaded with all the features a parent and child could ask for. I especially like the individual lower recline feature. The stroller rolls with such ease and the rain cover being included is a great idea as they cost around [...] which takes the base price up on many other strollers. Our little guy's both a year old now (they are twins) have a great time in this stroller and seem to be very comfortable. I was thinking of purchasing a model with front swivel wheels but I just did not like the way the swivel wheel felt. I tested three different brands. The one I liked sold for more then [...] and compared to this stroller I just could not justify spending that kind of money. The other two front swivel wheeled strollers that I tested had a rattle feel to the front wheel area which I was so surprised about considering they both sold for more then [...]. I am not sure if that was because they were 12 inch wheels or if it was the designs. This stroller is one of those purchases I am very pleased about and it has held up perfectly for us over the last year 
This is exactly what we needed to keep our baby from getting hurt on the bath tub spout 
This is a great product and has tight fitting lids. It is also dishwasher safe and microwaveable. This vendor also ships to APO addresses - thank you. 
This dish is great for those parents that are on the go and need to take baby's meal with them. The snap on cover is good and it's all dishwasher safe 
This dish is the best - especially if your child will be with a sitter at all. You can prepare meals with a hot dish and cold fruit that can be kept seperate during heating. I am getting several more for our second baby 
This is one of my favorite gifts to buy new moms...they'll get more use out of this gift than just about anything I can think of! Not only is it easy to use, it's dishwasher safe, it can fit just about anywhere, you can store anything in it, the colors are bright and kids like to play with them. I think it's also economical and enviornmentaly friendly since ziplock baggies are so expensive you'll end up saving a lot of money by using the snap apart dish. The best part is that these hold up really well while keeping your snacks/food fresh...I just love these!! 
I ordered this carseat after reading all the great reviews it got- it is a really nice, attractive, and comfortable carseat! Only thing is the plastic latch that snaps in front of the baby's chest can be kind of hard to "unsnap" sometimes, but overall I love this carseat! Matches the black interior of our car too 
This car seat is magical. We had ot switch to this seat when our boy turned 4 months old - when he grew out of the infant seat carrier. He is so comfy in this seat that he never cries in the car and he easily falls asleep in it. Sometimes he falls asleep the instant he gets put into the seat! This is a baby boy that used to cry cry cry all the time in the car. I am so pleased with this purchase! 
I searched for months before buying this seat for my daughter. I read lots of reviews on the internet and had a hard time deciding if I should spend $219 on this seat of just buy a cheaper one. I am so happy that I went ahead a spent the extra money. This seat is SO worth it. The print is great and the fabric is very easy to clean. My daughter loves to snack in the car and can make quite a mess. I just vacuum the crumbs occassionally and wipe down any other messes with a damp cloth. The restraint design is great and very easy to access and use. The straps have never gotten twisted or tangled like some other cheaper seats do. I used this seat in the rear-facing position for about 3 months until my daughter was big enough to turn forwards. It was very easy to use in this position as well. I love the button you push to loosen the straps and it was still easy to use even in the rear facing position (this is a problem in some other convertible seats). I have a Nissan Maxima and the seat fit very well both front and rear-facing in this relatively small car. I highly recommend this product!! 
You can download your own music into an mp3 player or an ipod. Great sounding speakers, latches onto crib 
We have this system on our baby's crib, and he seems to like it more than just having music playing on a nearby stereo. The sound quality is good at low volumes, which are appropriate for a crib at bed or naptime, but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it at all. So, if you are planning on using this for yourself, think again - but that's not what it's designed for. I do agree that the no-A/C adapter option stinks, but having caught our baby holding on to the IPod charging cord when the IPod was in this device, I realize that having an A/C adapter would just be a hazard - rechargeable batteries would be a great addition - that's the only reason I'm giving it four stars. Our baby LOVES to look at the lights. The 15 minute timer is great too, as that's all he really needs. I'd buy it again, and plan on getting it for friends with new babies 
After throwing my First Years crib CD player literally in the trash can (don't get me started on what a complete hunk of junk that thing was), I was on a search to replace it. That is when I came across the iCrib. You really can't beat the price - I'm guessing it is reasonable since most of the controlling is done from the iPod itself. Granted I have only had it a few days, I cannot rave enough about it! It mounted perfectly on the crib and I think the sound is fantastic (I have only tried classical and not music with lyrics so I cannot comment on that sound quality). I inherited my husband's older iPod Shuffle after I gave him a Nano for X-mas. I searched and searched online but could not figure out whether the iPod Shuffle would work with it. Muchkin's customer service verified that it would because it came with a few adapters to accomodate different MP3 players. Now, I don't really think they made one to specifically fit the Shuffle, but it did fit well enough in the "small" adapter they included so I was happy (see the picture I posted of the Shuffle in the iCrib). The iCrib itself has 3 modes - light only (iPod is off), light and iPod, or just iPod. You can also have it play for 15, 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off. The light is actually what I would consider a "light show" with the light slowly changing colors which I think is rather calming as does my baby (or at least it seems). The only things I would change about the iCrib is that I would really like it to have the option of playing longer than 60 min. I would also be happier if it had the option of providing a steady, soft light to serve as a constant night light (no "light show") to guide me during the middle of the night feedings. Otherwise, I am thrilled with the iCrib 
Bella, my seven month old daughter, was recently given the opportunity to try her very own sound system. She was enchanted by the nightlight display and soothed by the music. Bella is easy to please, Mama is a harder nut to crack, a product has to meet several criteria to be deemed developmentally appropriate, or at the very least not harmful to her children or those of her readers. Cost is important, with all the available products on the market for babies and children you want to get the most for your dollar.[...] Quality and safety are essential, not only do you get a system with superb sound; Munchkin has added a volume control device to the unit to protect baby's delicate hearing from undue noise levels. I love this feature, because many baby products and toys have been found to be so loud they reach levels high enough to cause permanent hearing damage. Bravo to Munchkin for the added protective feature. Extras are always nice when spending your hard earned dollar, this unit offers a nightlight feature, a delicate display of changing hues bright enough that mom or dad can check baby in the crib, soft enough to encourage sleep. The iCrib can be used with or without the nightlight. The iCrib also has an auto shut off allowing for 15, 30 and 60 minutes of play. Ease of use is important when you are running a busy household. Set up and installation is simple, and if it easy for me, anyone can do it. You pop your MP3 player into the back of the iCrib, then hang it on the crib railing with the adjustable Velcro straps found on the back of the sound system. The unit can also be used for travel or enjoying in another room as it has the ability to stand on its own. Munchkin's iCrib was found by Bella and me to be an excellent product. It exceeds our expectations for cost effectiveness, quality, features, and ease of use. The recommended age for the iCrib is 0 and up, making it a wonderful gift either for the holidays or a baby shower. 
My new great-granddaughter looks like she's wrapped in the wings of an angel in this blanket. It's very soft and unique 
The blue cat cushystraps are SO soft! They are very easy to install, and have the added bonus of helping to keep the straps straight in her carseat... this way, when I go to put her in the seat, the straps are not and don't become twisted in the process. That used to be a bit of a problem with our Graco seat before we used the cushystraps. My 3 month old daughter loves to rub her face and mouth on the straps. I imagine theywould have helped hold her head too, when she was a newborn 
This wrap is soo comfortable. I initially purchased an over the shoulder ring sling and found that no matter how I positioned my baby my neck and back would end up killing me afterward. Then someone at my mothers group introduced me to the Moby and I fell in love. No more aches and pains and my baby loves it. Whenever he is fussy and he sees me take it out, he calms down. It looks complicated to put on, but with a few practice runs you will soon become a pro. I just started carrying him facing out and he is really enjoying it. This carrier is a great investment since it works for all ages (newborn - toddler) and there are so many different ways to wrap it. There is even a wrap for nursing, and one for carrying twins! I cannot recommend this enough! 
I received a different carrier and both me and my baby hated it. he couldn't see what was going on and it seemed to smother him and it hurt my back. I decided to purchase the Moby, and I am so happy with it. You can wear it a million different ways (well, not a million, but a lot) and it's so comfortable. It only took me twice to get the hang of how to put it on. My son loves it too. My shoulders or back never hurt after carrying him in it. I also love the book it comes with to show you the different ways in which to wear it. If you lose it, you can go to the manufacture's website, and you can download and print from there. I've bought two more for my friends since I got mine 
This is number one on my list for how my husband, daughter and I have survived her months of colic! What we like about it: - The Moby wrap was able to be used the day we brought our preemie baby home from the hospital. - The Moby wrap swaddles your baby snuggly to you. If your baby likes swaddling as much as our does, this is the baby carrier for you. - It spreads the weight out evenly across your back and shoulders and feels much better for longer periods of time (in comparison to our Baby Bjorn). - There are a variety of ways to wear your baby with this carrier. We have used it 4 different ways so far. Being able to pull the cloth completely over her so she can sleep soundly is a plus. The instructions are easy to follow and while it looks difficult to put on, it really is quite simple after you've practiced it 3 or 4 times. - The Moby wrap is easy to clean with being machine washable and dryable and there are no parts that can be broken or lost. What we don't like about the Moby wrap: - If you plan on wearing your baby to go grocery shopping or other things out in public, you need to put it on before you leave the house. It can be difficult to put on in the car or in places where you do not feel comfortable with the wrap touching the floor (parking lot, public floor, etc.). This is not a big deal, but important to remember before you run out the door. During the cooler months, I put the Moby on, then my coat. Bottom-line: The Moby wrap was an excellent purchase. Putting our daughter in it and walking around or bouncing on an exercise ball was one of the few ways to calm her during the height of her colic. Our daughter is now 5-months old and still enjoys the Moby. We expect to continue to use our Moby wrap for many more months 
Well, I don't have any children nor do I plan on changing that, however, I bought this Moby Wrap for my best friend for a baby shower gift and she was absolutely thrilled. She told me it's very ergonomically designed and comfortable for both mother and baby. She's been coveting one since the birth of her first child (she's pregnant with #2 now). She also told me that if you are creative there's all sorts of different ways you can wrap the dealy to attach your child to yourself, so that should be fun. The Moby wrap comes with a little packet detailing different adventures in child wrapping. I'm very happy I purchased this for a gift 
I've tried a lot: fleece pouch (my 2nd favorite), Snuglies, Maya Wrap, OTBH ... The Moby Wrap is comfortable and flexible (you don't have to worry about size) It's not too heavy or bulky, no buckles, rings, snaps or straps. It's great 
The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby. I don't have inverted nipples, I have 38 DDD or E breasts which were not to easy for a little baby to get a hold of the nipples with all of the extra flesh smothering her face, I know that sounds weird but hey... everyone has their own problems with breastfeeding in the begining. I just needed an extra boost so that my daughter could get a good latch. I stopped wearing them after a couple of weeks after she got the hang of it. Like I said... The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby. It really calmed us down in an already stressful time 
Our son was born in the middle of September. During the first day we definitely had problems. The day after having him my lactation consultant suggested these and hubby ran to babysrus to buy these. I wore them for an hr before feeding time and our son truly fed for the 1st time and was able to stay latched for the entire 40mins that he took. They were effective immediately and these were such a godsend. You dont have to worry about the nipple confusion etc that you might have with a shield, and previous review is right, most of the time I would easily forget they were there and would have to check to make sure. Also they are not noticeable under clothing so you can wear these anywhere. I also wore these when I had leakage problems and I never had to worry about leaking through my clothes in public or something. Our son is now 4mnths old and I havent had to use these since he was 2mnths old. I'm saving these for any future kids of ours and I recommend them to anyone with inverted or flat nipples 
My daughter was hospitalized and forgot how to nurse and would naw and get frustrated. The nipples on the shield are long and she was able to re-learn how to nurse using these shields. I highly recommend these for moms who have trouble nursing 
these works wondres. I have flat nipples and was getting very frustrated with breastfeeding. This was my last resort before I was going to give up. They have worked great with drawing out the nipple. I noticed a different within the first day of wearing them. They also help sore nipples too 
We are expecting triplets, and needed three cribs. Though affordable, this product does not look cheap at all. My husband assembled them all by himself in three hours. It fits a regular crib mattress. Although one of the height-adjustable sliding frames had a problem with its spring and the drawer is somewhat unstable, we are still more satisfied than disappointed. Hope the babies will love them too! 
I ordered this crib for my daughter who will arrive on or before March 30, 2007. We received this crib one week before the actual delivery date, so that was a nice surprise! My husband and I put the crib up with no problems at all! The wood is not the best quality, but what do you expect, you paid $180 for it! The finish is nice and makes it look like an expensive crib. There was only one scratch mark and it was on the back of the crib, so it really was not a big deal! Overall, we are extremely pleased with this crib and cannot wait for the arrival of our daughter 
Like the cherry to suit our bedroom furniture and it is not very flimsy as the other cribs we saw for similar price range. The box arrived in time and had almost everything in good condition, except for the rails. Called the storkcraft customer service number and they shipped the brand new rails in time. Overall a pleasant experience. 
Me and my wife have two toddlers, the older 3 years and the younger 9 month old. We searched for a sturdy twin stroller for quite a while that would be comfortable for the kids and comfortable to use. In short this stroller is a dream! The Duallie Revolution is by far the best twin stroller on the market and the BOB products seem to be built to last. Highly recommend 
I have a Bundle Me already, but it has been getting too warm for it. However, it's still chilly enough and at times windy that I still needed a cover. I love the Original Bundle Me so much I invested in this liter one and I love it. My little one loves it as well! It's so soft and still keeps her cozy! Highly recommend 
I love this little Tigger jumper. It has a Tigger head on the front and a little tail on the back. I read reviews of kids getting injured from other jumpers that had trays, which is why I chose this one. We also have a Jumperoo, which I like too. 
this is a great item the only thing i don't like is it is hard to get child in and out of otherwise baby loves it 
I have a 5 month old and a 23 month old they both love it, the only thing is that it is REALLY hard to get them out that is why it got 4 stars 
Twenty-five years ago my son had a Johnny Jump Up! We spent hours laughing at his antics and he loved it. This item is a definite improvement over the old. It's higher and gives more support, it's cuter... and most important.. it's actually washable! Now I know not all kids will like these. I've heard of a few who just hung there and refused to bounce, but chances are your little ones will love it. My new grandson sure does 
The Bouncing Tigger that we purchased for our daughter is wonderful. I love how the front and back of the seat come up high and it supports her. Also how it is washable. She has so much fun bouncing around in it. Also the clamp that holds it in the doorway is extra tight. I feel secure in knowing that it is going to support her while she is playing. 
For tykes that are always creating new things from playdough to serving tea. This folding table and chairs are just great 
Love this. I've washed it a few times, run a mop over it, and even had the vacuum on it as well. Not one part of it is falling apart. Nice grip on the bottom too. Love it, and it doesn't have some silly cartoon character printed all over it!! My kitchen doesn't have to look like a nursery -- yeay :- 
I got this mirror as a baby shower gift. I absolutely love it! I can just look in my rear-view mirror and see my son in his car seat. I like that I can check on him while we are driving. It's great 
Product arrived in record time. It was quick and easy to assemble. Best yet it fit and looks good in the hard wood hall way entry we needed to place it in to keep our pet from entering a Music study/practice room where my wife keeps her precious Baby Grand Piano and Persian carpets. 
This was a really nice buy. The toys are very bright and colorful, and they were pretty well together. My niece loved them. The only thing that I have as a con is it comes in one box and some pieces were loose. Other than that, very nice 
I purchased this stroller for my newborn and a 2-year-old. I originally planned on getting a tandem (front-to-back) stroller, but when I test-drove it at the store it felt like a huge, long, heavy and clumsy tank (and that's without the kids in it!) There is no way I'd be able to maneuver the tandem stroller on the busy city streets. Then I tried this Aria Twin Side-By-Side stroller, and it felt so much better then the tandem - it was so light and easy to maneuver. So I purchased it, and I really like it. It says that the stroller is from 6-month-old and up, but I successfully use it with a newborn - the seat reclines almost fully, and the newborn lays in it and sleeps. This stroller fits through all standard doors and most supermarket isles. The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff. Walking in the city with my 2-year-old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller. The only major downside of this stroller is that it doesn't hold a car seat. 
I am very happy with stroller car seat combo. I take it everywhere because it does not weight a lot. You can store it anywhere. Very convenient to carry. It is highly recommended. The price of the set is terrific 
I received the Combi Ex Travel System for my baby shower. It looked like the perfect size/ weight for city living. Unfortunately it did not work out that way. The stroller began squeaking and falling apart from all of the bumping around on brick and cobblestone through the city. The basket is also very very tiny and is inhibited by a large bar through the middle. I would reccommend this stroller for use on smooth surfaces. The carseat is great and easy to use, but the stroller was not what I expected. One tip for the urban parent-- sink your $$ into a good stroller with shocks. It's worth it 
after checking it out moving things around open and close a few times took the seat out and put it back and I love it! Easy to use, very soft, and perfect for me but I'm 5'10" 
I received this travel system yesterday and couldnt wait to put it together. The car seat comes fully assembled but the stroller needs to be put together. I didnt find it difficult at all since everything just snaps into place. I gave this 4 stars because I find it a little difficult to attach the carseat to the stroller. I find myself having to try quite a few times before it snaps into place. The other thing is that closing the stroller needs some practice before you can get it right. Other than those two issues, the stroller system is very classy and different from others out there. The material is very soft to the touch and the huge wheels make it a whizz to push around. 
I purchased this stroller for my grandaughter and I can`t say enough good things about it!The stoller and carrier are beautiful.The color teal is true to color,it`s very suttle.My daughter is a young mother so she wanted to have a stroller that`s effective and looking good at the same time.This stroller is the best 
I went through many AA batteries before discovering this little gem. This fits my Medela Pump-In-Style Advanced pump. I've heard that it doesn't fit all Medela pump models, so just verify first 
I too bought this for a road trip I was taking. It worked like a charm. As a little warning: I usually pump on speed 5, however, with the vehicle adapter, I guess the power is that much stronger, I could only pump on speed 1 or 2. Don't go cranking that baby up at first. The cord was nice and long, so I was able to pump from the back seat. I keep it right with my pump just in case 
I purchased the car adapter for a 10 hour drive that my husband and I were making with our toddler and infant. I pump exclusively (not able to breastfeed) so the adapter was a Godsend! We didn't even have to pull over. Just make sure you are well covered and don't end up stuck in traffic next to people who are probably wondering what you're up to (unless you're into that sort of thing) 
This seller provided this great item ( hard to find locally ) quickly conveniently, at a great price. The diaper pail works great - wonderful that you don't need special bags. Very pleased 
I have placed the stinkiest and most foul diapers in this diaper pail and TRUST ME It works! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I do have to change the garbage bag once a week and I feel that the bag is only 1/2 to 3/4 full. I read the others reviews about the odor seeping out, but that hasnt happened to me. My husband even throws diapers in this pail unwrapped (poop hanging out everywhere) and we have not had any odor problems. I think this is a wonderful buy 
I purchased the stroller sight unseen, no one around here has it in stock yet. I have a 20 month old and a 7 month old. YES, it is STILL heavy, but Graco never claimed it was LIGHTER, just more COMPACT, so I just figure it will help tone my arms up! It gets around great! The only two things I found I would change on the stroller are 1) the cupholders are small in diameter and do not accomodate most of my sons sippy cups....and 2) I have a hard time lowering the cargo basket, maybe its just my model? I received the stroller with the brake shattered, but called Graco and they immediately sent a replacement free of charge.... great cust service. I'd spend the money again 
I have a 19 month old daughter and one due in August, so I have been on the look out for a double stroller that I actually liked. When we saw the quattro duo we couldn't wait for it to come out. We waited for it to hit the shelves which did not happen around here yet. So we nervously ordered it online without a test drive. Our nerves were settled when we recieved it the other day. Yes it is heavy, but I manage fine. It is longer than the picture but if it was any shorter you could not fit 2 children in it. This stroller has too many nice features to dwell on the small negatives. The best part besides the easy fold down is that it fits easily with room into my car (I have a Mazda 6). This was a big worry, but not anymore. I love this stroller and and very happy with the purchase 
I have never been so excited about a new gadget. Put it together in ten minutes with the assitance of my very excited toddler. I was getting very impatient waiting for this stroller to come on the market, but couldn't be more pleased that I did. I had researched them all and was going to buy it sight unseen, which made me nervous. Went to a local retailer yesterday and after an instore test drive with my almost 3yr old and my 3 month old bought it immediately. I can't say enough great things about this stroller. Especially as a mom of toddler and infant. It handles like a dream all the bells and whistles are fabulous. Folds like a piece of cake. Which I can't say about my perego. The basket drops down so you can access it without changing the rear seat position. My 3yr old thinks it is the coolest thing ever and she loves the fact that her baby sister is right behind her. Yes it is a little heavy, but I am a small woman and can manage just fine. After all my oldest weighs 28lbs. It is a little longer in person than in the photos - (no big deal) We all went for our first family stroll after dinner last night it was amazing. Handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need to prop up the srtoller to get over a bump. So STURDY - feel like both my girls are snug and safe. Love that the five point harness is attached to the seat, unlike the perego. Really if you have to children (particularly a baby and toddler) this is the way to go!! 
I just received this stroller yesterday. I am 9 months pregnant and I was able to bring it inside and put it together by myself in less than 15 minutes. I did notice that the right break had been crushed in shipping. I called Graco this morning and they are sending me a new one for free, no questions asked. The stroller is a bit longer than it is portrayed in the picture, but it is still smaller than the Duo Glider, and it handles wonderfully. It is definately something I would not mind taking to the mall! I love how the rear basket can be dropped down, not being able to access it with the baby seat in was a peave of mine with my quattro tour single. It is a little tough to get the baby seat in and out because there is not a lot of space, but it is nice that it is so compact. I am sure I will get better with practice. If you are looking for a double stroller, this is the one to buy! 
After receiving no help from Babies R Us in trying to order this, we decided to go ahead and purchase this without even touching it. It made me nervous, but after reading everyone's reviews, I figured, lets give it a shot. Wow, love this stroller! I am still working on putting the infant seat in and out, but as far as menoovering this, it is great. I have a son who is almost 3 and loved it so much that he wanted to be pushed to his bedroom in it, and this thing went around corners with no problems without even bumping the walls. Now, I know the purpose is not to use it in the house, but after reading a review that this was hard to steer I had to make sure I put this comment in here. This stroller is so much more attractive than the old Duo Gliders', I feel like a hip mom 
I have been researching strollers for months. I also considered the Combi, Aria twin, and Maclaren. I test drove the side by side strollers but they couldn't fit through tight store aisles. I liked the Combi and the Aria's width but they were awkward to steer and I didn't care for the storage in any of them. I agree with the above comments but the pros outweight the cons. It is heavy and it doesn't fold down as compactly as I would like but my son absolutely loves climbing in the front seat. I am 5'2" and I liked the handles and found it very easy to steer. I love the storage baskets and my infant seat fits great. I am happy with the Metropolitan fabric. It seems like I can wipe clean. I fit most of my grocerys in the basket underneath so I don't have to put both children in a "germy" shopping cart. Cup holders are nice too. Very easy to fold..easier than my single Graco stroller. 4 stars because it is heavy and a bit awkward to carry. 
I owned the Quattro Tour single stroller, and was so excited when the Duo version came out. I ordered it without ever seeing it, and it has definitely lived up to my high expectations. Simply stated, this is a heavy duty deluxe version of a Duo Glider - worth the extra money if you can afford it. The seats are large enough for growing children - I have a one yr old and a two yr old, and I foresee they will both fit in the stroller for a couple of years. I "test drove" all other double strollers at Babies R Us and Baby Depot, and they all seem to have low seat backs, which won't give any head support if the child falls asleep. The stroller itself is heavy, so if you have to lug it around or upstairs, keep this in mind. I keep mine in the back of my truck, so just getting it in and out is no big deal. I read other reports stating it is hard to steer, and I have had no problems with steering at all. One thing I can say, is if you are a tall person, this stroller is awesome because of it's higher handle grips. I am 5'9", and my husband is 6'4" and we both use it with ease. The underseat basket is large, and there is an additional "cubby" under the front seat great for extra storage. Parent cupholders and child trays/cups are designed well. Fabric is high quality. The only minor thing I am annoyed with is the low quality seat restraints ("Seat belts"). My single Quattro Tour and DuoGlider both had high quality padded seat belts with much better buckles. This one has very low quality nylon straps and marginally acceptable buckles. (I also received my box in very poor shape - open crushed on one side. I only noticed scratches to the stroller, so didn't feel it was worth going through a return process for cosmetic issues. What is up with the shipping???) ***ULTIMATELY*** After hours of "test drives" and quite a bit of research, I would recommend this over all other equal and higher dollar strollers. It is overall very high quality, and for those worried about style, it is a very sharp looking stroller in person 
I received my Graco Quattro Tour Stroller last week after waiting over a month for it to be released. It was SO worth the wait! This stroller is so easy to steer and both kids have plenty of leg room! There is a large storage basket underneath and plenty of cupholders. It pushes like a dream, even with my 2 boys who are over 30 lbs each! I have owned Duo Gliders in the past and they were so much bulkier than this and so hard to steer. I HIGHLY recommend this stroller. On another note, I was very pleased with the service I received from Amazon.com! 
My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them. I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct! All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see! 
I absolutely love these bottles. I have used them with all 3 of my children with great success and my oldest is almost 15. Gas was never a problem and my babies hardly ever spit up. Everyone always commented on how nice my babies always smelled because they never had that sour smell that babies that spit up so much do. I worked in numerous daycare centers and any time a parent had problems with a gassy baby that spit up all the time I always recommend Platex Nursers to them. 9 x's out of 10 their problems were drastically reduced thanks to Playtex. I am now pregnant with my 4th baby and though I plan to breastfeed as much as I can if I need a back up bottle or nursing doesn't work for some reason then Playtex will be my bottle of choice. Of all the new bottles out there on the market Playtex will still be my number 1 bottle of choice. If there would be any drawback at all it would be the cost of the liners. But I often got lucky and would find some at yardsales or on sale and would stock up. Also some store brands carry liners just as good. I had a few plastic bottles around just in case of running out but my babies didn't like them nearly as much and I could always tell a difference in their happiness because they would get gassy again. Buy the Playtex Nursers. They are well worth the money 
We recently just bought this tub after having one of those convertible tubs which we hated. This tub is great and my daughter loves it. Her long legs aren't scrunched like in the other tub and we don't have to worry when she squirms because all the sides are soft. It is easy to fill and drain and travel with. The bottom isn't slippery so although she can't sit up without assistance she is able to sit up in this tub without slipping. We highly recommend this tub. The Jr. size is perfect for the younger months....she just turned 4 months and maybe we will even get the bigger one...the deluxe!! This makes bathtime enjoyable for us all! 
I have twin girls (8 months old) and once they learned to sit up they no longer wanted to lay back in the original tub I bought them. I tried to fix it so that they could sit up, but it was complicated, and they were just not comfortable. I bought the Snug Tub Jr. so that they could have a place to sit and enjoy bath time safely. Even better... I bought two of the snug tubs and they both fit in our standard tub. They sit up, face each other and the inflated sides make me feel comfortable that they won't hit their heads. The only bad thing I have to say is that it is a little hard to close the plastic stopper. But overall, we LOVE it 
The gate is wonderful--once you get it in right. The instructions don't give you clear enough directions and I ended up putting the latching piece on upside down the first time. The pictures were pretty useless, but once you figure out the right way to install it goes in in a snap. To make it more stable you can keep the gate locked to swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching on it. We had to move our once our kitchen remodel was done and it came down simple and went up in a new door way really easy. The latch itself on ours has to be pushed down as it will not latch into place by itself now but it is a very solid gate. And for being over 2 years old it has held up great. The latch handle can't be opened by anyone with small hands as you have to squeeze both sides so anyone with kids under 2-3 who can open it have installed it wrong. Make sure the latch is hooked to the wall properly. 
I got this as a gift off of my baby registry. Although it is quit heavy to carry, I haven't had any major problems with this seat. I like the look and quality of the product. My son doesn't mind the straps and I hope that as he grows it won't be a problem for him. We are happy about this gift and plan to buy the stroller to match soon. 
We've been using Peg Perego's newest SIP car seat since our son was 6 weeks old. Our son LOVES this car seat...he NEVER fusses in it and is always happy to go for a ride! As other posters have mentioned the seat angle is very high and upright. We personally didn't find this to be a problem as it helps with our son's reflux. Another poster mentioned the straps are uncomfortable, however pads for the shoulder straps are included with purchase. We found the canopy to be quite sufficient. We have an older Primo Viaggio from 2002 and like the features of the 2006 version ever better. Yes, it is expensive but IMO the safety of the seat is worth it. Plus, you don't have to re-thread the straps everytime you need to readjust the shoulder height 
This swaddler is a must for anyone who has a newborn, i have two of these and we use them every time he sleeps, both at night and during naps. They are so much easier then regular swaddlers that he squirms out of, or just come undone, arent big enough ect. 
We swaddled our daughter until she was 6 months old. This blanket does not work on very small babies, but we started using it around 2 months. It is wonderful. The only problem we had with it was when our daughter was strong enough, she could break out of it. At that point we switched to the Miracle Blanket (which really works like a straight jacket.. there is no escaping). Our daughter is now seven months old and sleeps unswaddled. She has slept through the night (12 hours) since two months of age, and I really believe that she is such a good sleeper because of the swaddling 
These things are great! If you have a colicky baby (and most of us do to some extent) read "the Happiest Baby on the Block" and get the SwaddleMe baby wrap. Yes you can learn how to swaddle with a blanket, but these are SO much easier, in part because how many LARGE square blankets do you actually see out there (required for swaddling)? Only downside for us is that the velcro loop section wears out in about 2-3 weeks depending on usage levels. Not a huge problem, since the need for swaddling usually ends around 3 months, and they aren't expensive. It would also be nice to have the loop section larger, to accommodate longer skinny babies. Our son is a bit too long for the small, but WAAY to skinny for the Large 
I received this bassinet as a gift while pregnant with my second child, after telling my mother that the second time around I wanted a better bassinet that has a side that comes down to access baby easily (the one I used with my first was a cheap hand-me-down bassinet, which was fine, except I couldn't see the baby or pick her up without having to basically get up out of bed). This was a great find! My son is almost 5 months old now, and he doesn't want to leave this bassinet (but it is definitely time, he is big for his age and is really outgrowing it). Things I am happy about: * I am able to see him without having to hardly lift my head at all, and can pick him up without having to strain or get out of bed... WONDERFUL! * This is the mini co-sleeper, and is small and unobtrusive. Fits nicely next to my side of our bed, with not a whole lot of extra room in that space. Easy to tote around when traveling as well, once broken down is quite compact. * Folds up very easily, similar to a pack-n-play but even easier I think, once you know how to do it (take the mattress out, press the buttons on the rails and fold). * Has a great little place to store extra blankets, the instructions, the carrying case, etc, below, in a zipped-up compartment. Things to note: * The mattress is a bit hard (basically like a pack-n-play mattress, a board topped with some padding and a polyester or whatever material cover), so I top it with the sheet it came with, along with a blanket that I tuck tightly under the sides. * The mattress does not sit flush with the side rails. The lowered side rail sits at the same level as your bed, and the baby mattress is a bit lower than that... so the bassinet is not exactly an extension of your bed, you cannot just reach across and scoot baby to you (I thought it would be like that, but it isn't)... but actually I like this a bit better after all. * They sell leg extensions that raise the bassinet to the height of your bed if need be. We needed the extensions, and after putting them on the lower side rail was at the same level as our bed. The extensions made the bassinet a bit wobbly, which worried me some, but turns out it is just fine, even with my 2-year-old bouncing around in it! * Our little one did end up with his head against the side on a few occasions, but like someone else wrote, the one side is mesh, and he was just fine. You kind of have to make sure the mattress lies level in its spot, kind of hard to explain without a visual aid, but basically the board in the mattress creates the level surface, underneath it is just a mesh screen that has Velcro to connect the sheet (which also has Velcro) in the right place. Hopes this helps in your decision-making! 
Having lost a neice to SIDS, I was very nervous that my baby would stop breathing at night. This co-sleeper got me through the first 5 months because I could reach over and check her breathing any time during the night. I could sleep or nap right next to her without fear of rolling on her. She would not sleep in it until she was 3 weeks old, but after that, she was just fine. I would definitely use it again if I have more children 
My first child was a terrible sleeper and ended up spending most nights of her first year sleeping in bed with us. When my second was born I did not want to repeat the horrible year of sleepless nights. We got the co sleeper and have never slept better with a baby in our room! It was not hard to set up. I put it up by myself 2 days before I delivered without any problems. All you have to do is follow the directions. It was nice to have the baby so close to me for nursing, but not actually in the bed. Everyone slept better. As for the sheets, I went to the fabric store and bought a long piece of flannel and tucked it under. It stayed put and worked for the 7 months we used the co sleeper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a baby sleeping in their room 
This item was well loved in our family. I want to go ahead and state my only disappointment with it though that was the fact that it took a lot of elbow grease to collapse it for travel or storage. It was very stiff always became my husband's job. He didn't like to do it either, by the way. Otherwise it was great to have I was able to use it until my daughter was 8 months old (by then she could crawl out so it was not safe to use). It was nice to have her close for the middle of the night breastfeedings. And since we only have a queen bed, it was good to be able to put her into it after a feeding so my husband I could have more room in the bed. Finally, for the middle of the night diaper changes or clothes changes (my daughter was a HUGE spitter upper) it was wonderful to have everything right there where I needed it. It was like a second changing table. I used it as a changing table while I was sitting on the bed. If I was standing, it was uncomfortably low. I had to bend down too much. (I'm 5'10") One more thing-it's great for when your baby wants to nap. I rolled it close to the window when she was a newborn so she could get some sunlight to help rid her of jaundice. 
I live in a studio apt. with limited space and this is perfect for me. I love the storage on the bottom I keep all my sons blankets and sheets in there. It is just the right size and fits snuggly in the corner. I do however have the same problem as another mom. My son likes to scoot himself diagionally and ends up sleeping with his face against the wall. But his nose does not press against it and the walls are ventilated so I dont worry to much. I have cats and the canopy works perfect in keeping them out of the sleeper. The sheets are very pricey at about 15$ each one of my complaints. I like the fact that the matress has a wipeable surface. It is so much easier to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone; as well as grandparets who are looking for something when thier grandkids come to visit 
When I saw this toy on Amazon, I kid you not, I jumped up and down. This is one of the most beloved of all the toys that we bought our nephew, and he has lost the cars over the years. So I may buy it again just to get them back for him ... he loves it so much that when I called the other day, he was playing with the empty garage. The garage doors can get off track momentarily, but it's easy to fix. If you teach a child -- and the adults who play with him -- to put the cars back in their garages each time, it becomes a marvelously portable toy with which to play for hours. We gave it to him around 21 months and now at almost five, he still likes it. It's especially gratifying to see such love for a no-tech toy from a kid who constantly receives toys that light up, beep, and do other 21st-century tricks. Here is a simple toys that brings hours of fun for years and years 
My daughters are preemies so I was very concerned about the spaces in the crib. This product has worked very well so far and I'm happy that I purchased it. 
Used for 2 kids so far... The Good: * It protects his feet/arms from getting stuck in the slats. * When they pull up, they can chew on the material instead of the wood. * Easy to remove to wash. The Bad: * The velcro straps at the bottom aren't long enough so they don't stay done. * The head and foot pieces slide down when pulled on. * First son pulled one of those pieces down and climbed up on it. If this is all you can get, I'd get it, but it does need some improvements. 
This shield can be used longer than a regular bumper pad, you don't have to remove it when baby starts climbing. It prevents lil arms and legs from going through the slats when they start wiggling and it's breathable so no worries about baby suffocating in those fluffy bumpers. Everyone should use this system 
After waking to serious screaming from the nursery to find her six month old had caught her leg between the crib rails my daughter and I searched for a solution to the problem. Thanks to reviews from other parents who had experienced similar problems we found the Crib Shield System. It works perfectly.Although baby Emma tries she has not had a repeat entanglement. So now she is on to bigger and better things. The Crib Shield System would make a great gift for exspecting parents. One less thing to worry about. One you probably never even though of; but baby will 
I like that these are clear. Unfortunately my daughter stopped using a pacifier, but when she did use it, I liked being able to still see her beautiful face 
My babies loved to be swaddled, in fact, they slept best swaddled in the Swaddleme. This blanket was just great, I didn't discover it until they were about 2 months old, so I bought the larger size which we used for a good long while. The velcro is large and never did get worn out. I had one other brand that didn't stay put the way this one did. I used the Swaddleme for many months. I found it nice to use in a sling as well. Highly recommended if you have a baby who loves to be swaddled. 
The Swaddleme is an awesome product if your baby enjoys being swaddled. Our baby slept best when swaddled, but could often work his arms out of the blankets that we swaddled him in. We found that he stayed swaddled longer, and thus slept longer, when he was in his Swaddleme. I gave my sister one when she had a baby, and she loved it so much, she ordered two more. I couldn't find a local store that sold a large (when he outgrew the small one), and thus ordered it from Amazon. 
I *LOVE* this product. It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro. In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles. I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out. On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme. However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot. Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty. It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling. On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free. The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures. It is trickier to find, but worth the search. The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier. The velcro is quite versatile. 
I love this product. Our little one loves being swaddled and this is so easy to use. I dont have to worry about her becoming unswaddled throughout the night. We just moved up from the smaller one to the bigger size. The fleece ones are nice and warm too 
It is wonderful to find a product like this that fits older babies. My son is 5 months and still has to be swaddled at night to sleep. 
I JUST had a baby so writing a review is a totally amazing thing to do at this stage of the game - that's how much I love this thing. They should pass it out at the hospital. Regular swaddles come undone. This one stays in place and you can change a diaper without disturbing the arms, which is so important. Buy more than one. 
The Advanced pump works just as well as the Symphony pump that we used in the Hospital. I would definitely recommend this product. It is very helpful 
I've used all sorts of medela pumps, hospital grade Lactina, Symphony, and the PIS advanced is just as good if not better. I didn't like the Symphony at all b/c the diaphragm that goes on the machine has to be really tight or it won't have good suction (which is most of the time). I'm on my third PIS advanced. With my first child, I had the PIS advanced backpack, first generation, and pumped for a year. The amount of milk was adequate (had enough frozen away for extra month after I stopped). I just didn't like the faceplate (I broke 3, where you attach the tubing to the faceplate), and the storage space for the backpack is very limited. Then I bought the PIS advanced shoulder bag with my second child. The storage area is better but the faceplate is still the same. Then the PIS advanced limited edition came out. I saw it and fell in love with it. So I had to get it. It's the nicest one thus far and long overdue. The motor sits in a separate bag and the tubing can fit in the side pocket. There is no danger of breaking the faceplate. I can just carry that to and from work. I have two sets of parts, one for home and one at work). The bag has lots of storage space and best of all, it's chic. They have blue, chocolate and black. It also doubles as a diaper bag for me. As for hands free pumping: the only reason I was able to pump for a year fist time and now 11mo and still going is b/c of the hands free pumping kit. You have to get the Medela softcup bras (they're comfy anyway) that supports handsfree pumping. There are 2 tabs inside on the bottom and one latch on the top. You don't need to buy the whole hands free pumping kit; you just need the loop and hook attachment (part #3007073). That hooks onto the top of the bra where there is a latch. Then you tie a rubber band (thicker kind from any office supply store) around the tabs (3 of them, two sewn in the bra and one from the loop and hook attachment). Then you put the breastshield with connector with bottles attached on your breast. Then you loop the rubber band separately around the connector (the part where you're suppose to attach the tubing). Connect the tubing, Viola, it should stay there snugly. You don't have to hold them anymore. You can also use this method with the softfit breastshield. If you have larger breasts, use bigger rubberbands or link two together. Now you can massage to get more milk, eat lunch, type on the computer, whatever (just can't lie down). You can buy adapter for avent system and pump directly into their bottles, or other brands. And there is no need to pump every 3-4h after your milk supply is established... that's insane. In the first few weeks it may be necessary to establish supply. I pumped 4 times a day and was able to get min 30oz a day (I was bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively), then slowly decreased to 3, to 2 to 1 as my baby got older. The key is to pump all the milk out (with massaging and squeezing your breast) and then let it run 1-2min longer. Also, use the maximum suction you can tolerate (this will increase and plateau as you pump). If you want to decrease supply, just pump shorter and longer period of time lapse in between pumping. If you want to increase, pump longer and more frequently as well as drink more water/eat more. I could increase and decrease my supply at will, even without breastfeeding. I pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using the avent adapter (avail at Babiesrus). There are other systems out there. I used the lansinoh milk storage bags to store my milk. I store about 10-12oz (max 12oz) in each bag, squeeze all the air out, and deep freeze it for 6mo. I know lansinoh suggest less than that, but it can be done as long as you get all the air out. The trick is to use the side of a table, push the milk up to the ziplock and squeeze close the ziplock as the air is pushed out. Since there are two zippers, a little milk can leak out of the first zipper to help get all the air out. The bag will expand in the freezer just fine. Once it's frozen, just don't nick the bag (b/c it's easy to damage it) and it will stay fine for 6mo in a deep freezer. Even if you do damage the bag, it's ok. it's just a pain when you thaw it. When you thaw the milk, you might see a little precipitate, but baby likes the milk just like it was fresh. Happy pumping 
I received the pump in style as a shower gift for my first child over 3 years ago (2003). Due to medical problems early on I had to exclusivly pump for child #1. The pump worked great. I used it several times a day and it was very effective and comfortable. I used it for about 3 months straight after she was born. I stopped using it not because it wore out, but because pumping several times a day for months was so much work that I couldn't keep doing it. My determination ran out before the pump's did! After that I packed it up and planned on using it again if I had another child. Child #2 was born early December 2007 and I was very pleased to find that my Medela pump was still in excellent working order. Child #2 was a professional breastfeeder from day 1 so I only used the pump when trying to boost my supply or to relieve pressure from engorgment when the baby wasn't hungry. I'd say I used it a few times a week for the first 2 months. After 2 months I had to go back to work and my Pump in Style came with me. I've been working for a few weeks now and I use the pump twice a day. It works as good today as it did 3 years ago. The quality has not gone down one bit. I plan on feeding child #2 exclusivly breastmilk as long as possible and I'm confident that my breastpump will allow me to do so. If you plan on going back to work and pumping, or if you plan on having multiple children then this is a great pump for the job. It LASTS. Its expensive, but better to spend the money upfront, get a pump that works great, is effective, comfortable, and will last you through the years than to throw money away on a cheaper model that you'll end up replacing. The pump is so great that I'm willing to bet that it'll last right through child #2 and if we decided to have another child, it will be ready to go again in a few more years. 
I like the convenience of being able to carry this pump with me and I like that it comes with pump/freeze/serve bottles in a separate carrying case with a cooler block. Plus, the bag is good-looking and you wouldn't even know it's a breast pump. And the pump itself works well. What I was not thrilled about is that the bottles didn't come with nipples and the Medela nipples are not easy to find on their own. I had to buy a separate pump and store starter kit (4 bottles, caps, nipples) to get a decent supply. Also, the pump is a little louder than I thought it would be but if you zip the pump's compartment while you're pumping, it does cut down on the noise. Another thing is that I expected there to be different speeds of pumping like there was in the Ameda hospital pump I rented for a couple of weeks but even at $319, it has only one speed (although you can adjust the vacuum strength). Last, and this isn't directed specifically at this pump but at all pumps that can pump both breasts simultaneously... I don't think they're worth it. I don't really even pump both breasts at the same time anymore because it's not easy to sit there holding both cups over both breasts on top of adjusting the dials and possibly holding or trying to soothe a baby. I constantly broke the suction seals and dripped milk on my lap. And I spent so much time readjusting the cups and trying to get comfortable that I could have just pumped one breast at a time (which I do now). Fortunately, the Medela pump works pretty fast magic on me. 
I have such a difficult time breastfeeding that it is near impossible for me to do it without crying. After seeing tons of lactation consultants I finally decided to pump all of my sons feedings. I was given a slightly older model of the Pump in Style Original and was not very comfortable. So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month ($90 + starter kit). That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical. So I bought the PiS Advance. Although it's not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job. It's much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction. Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient, I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow. For most I'm sure the original is fantastic but if you're very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need (unless you want to shell out $90 a month. The Symphony retails at around $1250.00. OUCH!) Good Luck 
I am a daily user of the Pump in Style Advanced breast pump and very happy with the product. I've had to replace the Adapter and the Ice Pack which after contacting the Medela company, they replaced it for free and shipped the items out to me pronto! Make sure to have extra membranes on hand as they do wear out after frequent use; this will affect the efficiency of the pumping if you have faulty membranes. Their customer service line has also helped me out with troubleshooting which I have greatly appreciated as well. I've been pumping for 9 1/2 months now and plan to go the full year with the help of my Medela breast pump. 
I absolutely LOVE this pump. It is fast and effective and I get way more milk with this pump than I did with any other that I tried. Also-- these things are expensive so shop around so you don't overpay. I got mine from a private practice LC at Add A Little Love.com and got not only the pump at a great price, but the owner helped me with the issues I was having. Bottom line - the pump is great but only if you have someone to help and support you too 
I have been using the My Brest Friend pillow for three months and I LOVE IT! It is so secure and never slips or slides like the Boppy pillow or traditional pillows do. The cover comes off and can be machine washed, but does have to hang to dry, which is annoying, but still not enough for me to take a star away. MBF is also nice and firm, which I find a big advantage over the Boppy. I cannot recommend this pillow enough-I will be buying it for all of my friends who plan to breast feed 
Removable cover (zipper) make this easy to clean (just make sure the velcro is stuck to itself when you wash it or it will stick to all your nice socks. My wife tried a boppy for the first month then got this, which she used continually for the next six. You can even use it standing up or when you move around since the strap goes around your back. The strap also provides back support. The pocket is a nice touch (you put your Lansinoh in it) The only possible downside is it isn't that easy to put on with one hand (if you are already cradling the baby 
We lived abroad with my first born and we used our sit n stroll for three or four international flights a year!! The kid was comfy and as I was traveling alone with my son most of the time, I found it to be very managable with the sit n stroll and my backpack. Moved back to the states and had baby number 2--used it often as a loaner stroller to the grandparents--when they had the kids in tow--and I still used it for flights here--all in all a wonderful investment- Tips: You will need to ask for a seatbelt extender on airplanes--no big deal they have them--and you will need to raise the armrest to "click the seatbelt" and then lower it for takeoff. Good luck 
We bought this product back in 2005 and used it during an international trip through several airports. It worked as advertised in all the jumbo jets, and elicited generally positive reactions from other passengers and flight crew; however it could not pass through the aisles of an Embraer commuter plane that we had to take on a short leg of our journey. In order to secure it correctly on the airline seat, you may have to get a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant. Having this car seat/stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids; they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates. I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps... for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall. As a car seat it was OK, it just takes some getting used to. We never used it in a rear-facing configuration, so I cannot rebut comments made by other users as regards their problems in that mode. 
Going from lugging around a heavy infant carrier to the convenience of pulling this out of the car and pushing down a lever to bring out the wheels has been a glorious transition. It's not the best carseat out there, and is a tad inconvenient in some areas, but the ease of converting it to a stroller and taking my little girl into stores with it, far outweigh the other annoyances. One thing I will say - when the carseat is in the rear-facing position, it does tilt forward a bit for my liking. When my girl falls asleep her head is usually hanging forward because of the forward slant. The seatbelt has to go over the top of the seat, so you have to reattach everything every time you put your baby into it and that can get a little annoying. The stroller part is great though. And it's SO EASY to adjust the tightness of the straps. Despite the small wheels, it's actually a very smooth ride on concrete and bumpy parking lots. Much smoother then any shopping cart with her carseat in it, ever was - lol. I got this as a gift from my mom and didn't think I'd like it, but I really love it now. 
Triple Play Products are a joke of a company. They have no customer support, for example I needed to get a handle for my sit n stroll, it took 3 weeks of me calling nonstop for them to get aggravated enough to send me one. They also left a voice mail saying I was swearing and harassing them. First I never swear when talking to any kind of customer service even if it is a voice mail every time you call for three weeks straight. Second if by harassment they mean the first ten days that I called I was nice and the last 11 days I called I told them that their customer service is nonexistent and a joke and that the company had no business ethics what so ever, then guilty as charged. I also got in touch with Strolex the actual maker of the sit n stroll and tried to get parts thru them they gave me the Triple Play Products phone number. When I explained my problem with Triple Play to Strolex they didn't seem to be shocked, and even said other people have had the same problem with them. The product is great you can get one at [...]with the mesh bag and the sun cover and shipping. Great product I just hope you never have to replace parts, and if you do need to get parts plan on waiting 3 weeks for a response, and to be called a harassing customer because Triple Play Products has no clue what business ethics are 
The stroller is a little flimsy for everyday use, and the whole thing is kinda heavy (especially with the baby in it). It is not hard to transfer from stroller to car seat and back, but you need to have a little upper body strength if the baby is still in it. I use it as our regular carseat, but not our regular stroller. We only use the stroller option in airports. As for using it for flying, I wouldn't do without it. It is FAA approved, fits in all airplane seats that I've tried (coach), and it goes easily through the security checks. It is worth the cost just for this. I really like this product if you are a frequent flyer; however, it is kind of a money-waster if you don't 
I must say that this is a really good car seat/stroller. We needed it for a long trip from Europe to Oklahoma. It made it sooo much easier. Then when we got to the states it was great for the ride from the airport then the other cars we had to use. As we were waiting for our other car seats when began to love it even more. We were able to go from car to mall, church, movie, store what ever with ease. The only thing we didn't like was that it didn't have an umbrella or something to protect for shade and it isn't suitable for rough areas like gravel or large brick areas. It tends to move funny around those kinds of areas other than that it has been great 
Several months of research combined with real-world experience pushing my nieces and nephews in different strollers brought us around to the Bob Revolution. We wanted a stroller that could handle rough/uneven sidewalks, cobblestone streets, and off-road trails. We also wanted to use the same stroller at the mall, grocery store, and small shops. We have a compact, lightweight stroller for travel, so we focused on three-wheelers with air-filled tires, a rotating front wheel (a must-have feature for 3-wheelers!), and a canopy with excellent coverage. We looked at strollers from Mountain Buggy, Valco, Baby Jogger, Phil Ted, Dreamer Designs, etc. (we were willing to spend a good amount on a quality stroller, but we were not about to go for a Bugaboo). We decided on the Bob Revolution and we have been very happy with it. PROS 1. It is very easy to push over all kinds of surfaces and up hill as well as to steer with one hand. 2. The canopy is by far the best we've seen on any kind of stroller. 3. The front wheel swivels 360 degrees and can lock. 4. It folds/unfolds easily. 5. The seat is roomy and seems reasonably comfortable. 6. The shock absorbers do more than on the few other strollers that have shocks. 7. For a stroller of this size/category, it is not too wide, so we can bring it into small shops and navigate tight aisles and turns easily. 8. Although not compact, at least this stroller folds up to a decent size that is easy to fit into a car - most strollers in this category are much longer and a little wider than this when folded up. 9. Wheels are easily removable. 10. Not too heavy - lighter than similar strollers of this type. 11. Plenty of accessories available. 12. Good, rugged build quality. 13. Wheels are made of sturdy plastic = nothing to rust. CONS 1. The seat does not recline very far, and it requires you to adjust two straps (one on either side of the top of the seat back). 2. The footrest is not adjustable, and I would have preferred a metal/plastic kick plate. 3. When you fold the stroller, it is a little awkward to carry because the front wheel sticks out and you can't keep it folded up without rigging the wrist strap - a simple locking mechanism would be better. 4. Storage basket could be a little bigger. 5. Handlebar is not adjustable, however it is high enough for me (over 6' tall). 6. Seat could use a little more padding. Our son seems to be more comfortable in our little Combi. 7. No included accessories. Keep in mind that this kind of stroller is typically stored in a garage and not folded up all the time. This is an excellent stroller and worth the money. FYI, here's the main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones from: Mountain Buggy - canopy doesn't provide much sun protection, too big when folded, seat seams uncomfortable (hammock style, limited padding = squishes the child's shoulders in); great build quality though and easy to fold up. Valco - too difficult to fold up, expensive; fancy stroller with good padding; optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable for toddler if used more than briefly. Phil Ted's - seems less sturdy, fabric footrest too close to wheel so kids can actually push and impede the front wheel; optional second seat is innovative design, but sacrifices the storage area. Alternative: We were'nt able to actually see/test one, but the Boogie by Zooper looks interesting because it has a great feature set, adjustable footrest with kickplate, full reclining seat back, and comes with great accessories. Apparently, the 2006 model has been redesigned to be lighter and fix some issues in older models 
My husband and I really hesitated about spending this amount of money on a single baby item. We can look back now and say this is was our smartest purchase. The swivel wheel is perfect for the curving sidewalks in our neighborhood. The shocks make the ride as smooth as glass for our little girl. We bought the infant seat attachment bar and the beverage handle attachment bar as well. We are absolutely thrilled with this jogger! 
This stroller is worth every penny. The pivot wheel is fantastic. I have friends with their jog stollers and the stationary wheel and they struggle to turn it when we're out for walks. This one is so smooth and manuverable. I think the best feature is the sunshade. It is so much bigger than all of the other strollers. It really does a great job of keeping the sun off my baby's skin. 2 wishes: I wish it had a tray for the baby to keep cheerios a sippy cup and I wish that it reclined more 
One of the coolest features on this stroller is the front wheel that you can either lock into position or unlatch so that it rotates. Turns on a dime and is so smooth to push it actually makes using this fun. The shocks are great, baby isn't getting jolted around like in his regular stroller. Very pricey, but if you can afford it, well worth the cost 
Perfect traveling changing pad...our Graco baby wipes container fits into perfectly if need be along with diaper cream and two extra diapers so if you're on the go you can have it ready and not worry about the whole diaper bag thing. This product is easy to set up and take all the stuff out of the pockets you need (I can do it with one hand) and easy to clean. A must have for traveling parents 
I purchased this for my daughter when she out grew her baby tub. I didn't like the plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt. This is a very soft ring. It is definately for kids that can sit up on their own. I had other friends use this and they loved it enough that they also purchased one. It also comes with a nice hanger to hang it on the towel bar in the bath tub -- I didn't find it too heavy to hang 
My baby loves the change pad. He loves having his diaper changed and as soon as I place him on the pad, he starts getting hyper and happy. It's soft enough and I like the straps in case I need to grab something near by (don't leave baby strapped by himself though). 
I thought it was a great gift but it was a little high in price 
We love this seat. Our son is almost 10 months old and we have been using it since he was 4 months old!! I was going to go buy a highchair when we needed one- but we never needed one!! I love this chair. You can adjust the height as he grows; the whole thing goes in the dishwasher; the swing out tray is wonderful. He is very safe and secure when buckled in. We have never had a problem with him kicking off the tray and he's a very active baby. I would highly recommend this seat- especially if you do not have a very big kitchen and a highchair would be so cumbersome. Just make sure it is securely attached to your kitchen chair! 
This thing is awesome. We even took it to the restaurant with us before my child could sit up on his own. We didn't want to leave him in the car seat for an hour because (1)he would get restless and (2) the babies can get flat spots on the backs of their heads from frequent pressures of car seats/swings. The Bumbo allows you to sit your child (if they are unable or unstable sitting on their own) in front of you so you can face them and interact with them without having to support them. We took our child to a baby class and all of the babies had one of these. It really helped free up parents' hands so they could play with the children versus holding them up. Someone was really thinking when they made this product. Get it. Don't think twice. You won't regret it. 
I bought this for my four month old daughter. Within two weeks she was already sitting up unassisted for more than a few seconds because of the Bumbo. It satisfies it's job of being a sitting aid, and the baby enjoys it for about 7-8 minutes at a time. First, I was a bit hesitant about buying this due to it's high price, but I gave in and did. Am I glad that I did? I think I could have saved my money and used my baby bouncer for the same purpose. 
I've tried a number of monitors for both my kids (returned several as well), but this monitor hands down is the best for longest range and for least crackling noise. It's pretty much quiet as can be. In my view, it's not worth buying any other monitor but this one 
this monitor has excellent range, and picks up even the slightest sound. it clips onto my pants and has long battery life (as long as i recharge it overnight). highly recommended for range and clarity 
This is our first baby monitor, so I can't compare it against others, but we love it. It is very quiet (when the baby is asleep). There is very little static or interference. We haven't ever picked up any other conversation. I haven't been able to figure out what frequency is broadcasts at. The box and the instructions never say. As some others have mentioned, the LED (lights) indicators are nice. If I'm in the shower I can watch the monitor and see if the baby is making noise even if I can't hear it. Also, we have no problem with reception anywhere in the house. Our house is 2500 sq. ft one story just for comparison 
The monitor works perfectly, no hum or buzzing sounds, it is really silent until your baby makes a sound. Also the range is very good, much better than any other unit i have tried before. 
If you like transportation themed rooms this one looks so cute set up. We first got a sports themed set for our son but changed our mind to this one. The quality is great, the bumper is thick and the cars/trucks/stop signs are soft and fuzzy. Definitely a good choice but I like any of the kidsline crib sets. We bought a set from this company for our daughter and 2 years later and through many washes it has held up nicely 
We don't have a large bedroom, so the Mini works great! I love that our baby is right next to us, I'm right there if he needs me, and I feel quite secure using it. It's also quite small which makes for easy travel when we go on an overnight trip somewhere. It was definately worth it 
CoSleeper is a must! It works as a stand alone Bassinet as well as I can put it close to my bed with one side open and when baby wakes I don't have to get up - very convenient 
I like this because it was very easy to setup (it unfolds quite magically) and the strap that goes under the mattress keeps it quite securely close to the bed. The only complaint I have is that they don't include any height adjusters with it. So I will have to order them seperately. We decided the baby needed to sleep on a slight incline, so we ordered a foam wedge from Amazon 
I originally purchased the Avent Isis to use with DD because I was sure I would feel like a cow on the milk line if I used an electric pump, and I had read great reviews about the Isis. After the first two months though, I decided that the Isis was rather uncomfortable to use, and the massaging breast shield kept losing suction and leaking milk out the back, so I started researching pumps again. I knew I wanted a Medela, but some of their pumps weigh in at 8 pounds, and I knew I didn't want anything that NEEDED to use the complimentary "stylish backpack". When I found the Swing, and read the reviews, I knew it was what I wanted. It is nearly as compact as hand pumps, but uses the same two stage action as the more expensive Medela pumps. It is comfortable to use, I've had no problems with leaking, it seems more efficient and in general I just really like this pump. You can use double A batteries to power it, which is great if you are traveling (Airport? Camping?) The best part though, came about five minute ago when I realized that the threads on the Swing match the threads on the skinny Airvent bottles that are the only ones we can get DD to use!! No more random bottles, and no more pumping in to one container and then pouring into another container to use 
My baby was small (4 pounds 14 ounces) when born and was not able to nurse well. I established my supply on a rental Symphony from the hospital. When it came time to return the Symphony I debated whether to continue renting it or to purchase my own pump. The purchase price of pumps really scared me off, but I considered the Swing because it is intended for daily use, which is what I needed, but was not as pricey as the Pump In Style. I LOVE THE SWING. THe Swing is as efficient, if not more, as the SYmphony. THe fact that it is a single pump does not bother me at all because it is so efficient I am done pumping in 20 minutes - both sides. It is so lightweight and portable that you can go anywhere. After a month of being tied to the huge Symphony every three hours, it was a wonderful and welcome change to be able to go places with the pump. I am a full time working mom and currently use the Swing every day. I fully recommend this 
Bought for my wife, the pump works great. She was using Eveflo pump and this while not much faster is MUCH quieter. The only problem was having to buy a bigger shield to go along with it so that added to the cost but she is very happy with it 
I'm so happy that I splurged and bought this. I was using a manual pump, and getting sore wrists and it took forever to do. The Swing, though a little pricier, is totally worth it! The two-phase part really works well. I was pretty dubious at first, but it's been a great help to me as I return part-time to work. 
OK... so I've been told the Symphony is the Cadillac of breast pumps... but with a price tag of $[...] who can afford that?? Renting it cost $[...] a month if you can find a place to rent it.. I did and used it for a month.. I honestly was not totally impressed for the price. Then I read up on the swing this pump ALSO (like the symphony) includes the Medela 2-Phase Expression Technology - the new standard for unsurpassed naturalness, comfort and efficiency. AND after buying it.. I liked it BETTER then the symphony. Infact I think it works just about the exact same, which is crazy of Medela when the price is SO different. I have tried the Medela Pump in style as well as the Avant Isis and this one is the best. I would highly reccommend this pump. POSITIVES: This pump is portable. Comes with a travel bag, runs on batteries OR you can plug it in. The pump itself is about the size of a Hardees Hamburger. The breast shield is soft and very effective, you can control the speed and it has the letdown mode as well that automatically turns on after a few minutes. The breast shield is soft and comfortable, the suction and speed is the same as the symphony, the pump is SIMPLE to use, FOUR buttons-you can't NOT figure it out easily! It is FAST and emptys your breast totally. NEGATIVES: (I have to stretch on this one cause I love the pump) It's not quiet, I don't know why the other review says it is.. It's actually louder then I thought it should be.. but not louder then the Medela Pump in style or symphony. But just not "quiet" I don't want you thinking you are going to get something you can pump with at the front of a mini van and noone in the back is going to hear.. It's a Single Pump... I know.. DUH.. but it is a negative, if only they made a double with this size base, I'm almost tempted to buy another. I highly reccommend this pump, as a mom of three, I've tried a lot of pumps.. I think Medela is selling this pump short saying it is like the pump in style, I think it is comparable to the symphony! 
I use this pump all the time- for 95% of my baby's feedings. I actually have 2 of them. I keep one in the car with a clean bottle at all times and one in the house. The pump is easy to clean, and comes with spare parts. This manual pump is comfortable to use. I know that all of the experts recommend electric pumps, but I have done just fine using this manual pump and saved a ton of money over the electric pumps. The Avent bottles fit directly only this pump, so it's quick and simple to take the full bottle off the pump and either freeze it with a sealing disc, feed your baby by putting on a nipple top, or store it in the fridge with a nipple top storage cap. I must note however that 1 of my pumps is the older version of this model and the other is the newest version. The newest and current version leaks a little where the screw on grooves from the pump meet the bottle, as the older version with a different part did not. So, just be a bit careful when using this otherwise you'll have drops of milk on your clothes 
....and I would never have bought a second electric! All the other moms I know said get a Medela Pump in Style, but I thought if I could just *maybe* get a pump that took up 1/4" the space and made NO noise for $50, I'd try it. I'm not at all interested in trying another pump. I love having two, so I can keep one at work and one at home, or on weekends, when traveling, I can use one and then use the other, and both will be clean. I like the Avent bottles and nipples too. It took a series of complicated training sessions to show my husband how to properly assemble and use the Playtex Ventaire bottles, but the Avent bottles require a nipple, that's it! So easy 
I purchased this for when I was breast feeding my daughter and this allowed me to pump wherever I went, if I didn't want to feed in public. Very easy to clean and assemble. A little pricey, but well worth it. 
I use my Avent Isis manual breastpump 3-5 times a day and it works pretty well, but the white valve "star" got worn out after 2 months of use. When buying this pump make sure you buy extra white valves "stars" as spare parts, they are not expensive, its 1.25 british sterling pounds per piece. make sure you buy 10 if you are planning on using this pump for a year or more 
This is a fun and exciting new addition to my son's stroller. He really loves music so he is having a bawl playing with the piano on the toy 
My baby loves this toy, all the lights work fine and the 6 school blocks are so cute! I have no complaints. Baby plays with it everyday 
I did a little research before buying this stool and I always came back to the baby bjorn. I decided to order it and give it a chance and I'm glad I did. It's small enough to fit in my bathroom and wide enough to hold my daughter on it comfortably. She loves to stand on it and brush her teeth all the time now. It's wide enough to move around on and not fall as well as it has a grip on the top surface for little feet. I'd highly recommend this product-Baby Bjorn knows what they're doing 
I usually write very long reviews but I think I can cut this one short! Other step stools skid around, are too brightly colored and too short! My 3 y.o b/g twins have used this since they were 18 months old. They use it for getting to the sink, to get on the potty, to reach something up high, to get on the chairs to eat, an deven to get into bed sometimes! They LOVE them. The stools are very sturdy and I recomend them for ANYONE, whether you have kids or not, it holds almost any weight and is very convinient and the perfect height. We have one in each bathroom, one in the upstairs hall closet and one in the cabinet under the kitchen sink,(or under the table lol). That means we have 4 of these stools. They are very simple to use and I even use them to sit on when I wash my younger babies. I plan to have these around for YEARS. They are great, clean and blend perfectly into any room. Buy them, they dont skid and are great for ANY age 
Unlike some cheaper plastic stools, this one can hold Mom or Dad! It may not look like much online, but when you see and feel it in person, you realize that it really is much nicer than the $5 stools you find at discount stores 
My son who is 2 1/2 took this stool directly upstairs and placed it right in front of the potty where he proceeded to climb up onto the potty and proclaim himself a big boy! It is sturdy, it doesn't tip over, and the colors are not offensive. Baby Bjorn products are definitely worth the extra bucks. I'll have this stool for my grandchildren! We paired it with the Toilet Trainer by Baby Bjorn and we're super satisfied 
We have three of these stools in our house and we love them. Although my son is not particularly careful, we simply have not found a way to tip them... I even use one to reach high places in my kitchen. They don't slip, they are sturdy, and they look great. They may cost some money, but, as I have found with many different Baby Bjorn products, they are worth it 
We love our placemat! We have a 9 month old and she really likes to feed herself. This makes going to restaurants great for all of us. Kate can eat her cheerios etc and we do not have to worry about the table not being clean or Kate trying to teeth on the table etc. I have also used it on the airplane and it was great! It is great quality and easy to clean. It rolls up nicely and fits easily into our bag. Everywhere we go people ask where we found this great item! I highly recommend this for families who love to eat out or fly 
No more dirty tables for my 11-month old to eat off of. It keeps her food of the table and even has a piece that catches the food that does not end up in her mouth. The suction cups help to hold it in plac 
I use these mats with my 2 1/2 yr. old twins at my dining room table. They keep the mess off wood and are easy to clean. You can also travel easily with them. 
My friend has one of these for her 18 month old daughter. It's very convenient for use in restaurants, as it keeps the inevitable mess confined to the mat, and when you're getting ready to go, you can slide the mess into the little pocket for quick disposal. It suction cups to the table and your child has an instant food/toy/mess mat that is not only convenient for mom and dad, but is also appealing for baby to touch and play with. I am going to be having a daughter this year and have registered for one of these. I think it's a great addition to the diaper bag 
I bought this booster seat because we just bought a new table and chairs, and our previous hard plastic booster seat had rubbed some of the paint off of our old chairs. This seat is wonderful! It is soft enough to be comfortable, and my three year old can climb into it by herself without it sliding around on the chair. It rests against the wood of the chairs without damaging them in any way. I highly recommend it for the older toddler, but you might want something with a little more support for a younger child 
After looking at nearly every booster seat on the market, I decided to get this one, and I'm glad I did. My 4 yr old daughter loves this seat. The other booster seats are hard plastic and hurt her rear. This is the only one that I found that had a cushion and seemed easy to clean, and it is easy to clean. I like that it came in black too, as my table is black, so it doesn't stand out or look ugly. I also like that it came with a carry bag so I can bring it with us to the movies or plays that we attend and I don't have to worry about her being uncomfortable during them anymore. Great product!! 
I trained my son using this method when he was 2 years, 2 months. (My mom used a similar method with me in 1977 and recommended it) It worked really really well! He took a bit longer to learn to go poopoo at first, until I realized that HE thought he was "making messies" if he went in the toilet. I solved this by taking him around the house and showing him that the dishes go in the cupboard, clothes in the closet, toys in the toy box and poopoo in the toilet. He totally got it after that. He only had a couple accidents that I recall. I reminded him to go pee pee quite a lot at first, which I believed helped. I stopped all liquid drinking an hour to and hour 1/2 before bedtime and had him pee right before bed and right after getting up. I would highly recommend this prodect to everyone who's ready to potty train. : 
I love this secure and easy to use toilet lock. I used this lid lock with my toddler from 10 months until 3 years. The best thing about it, is that it works well, but does not have to be attached with adhesive, so it can be installed and removed easily for use or cleaning. I think that the previous reviewer must have had a strange potty, or more likely, just had it installed improperly. If used properly, it clamps onto the rim of the potty without being permanently attached. I found it was difficult to remove, and couldn't remove it just by pulling. It also doesn't rattle if it's installed on the front half of the toilet and NOT under the little buttons that keep the seat off of the rim. I have tried it on a variety of toilets. We were able to have a spare for travel, so every toilet was safe. I really can't understand what went wrong for the previous reviewer. I wish I could help her try to install it so it would work. There are two sizes of clamps to fit different sizes of toilet rims, I found I had to use one for our very old upstairs potty and the other for the more modern downstairs potty. You HAVE to clamp them tightly on the rim though, or it won't work, and would certainly rattle. Maybe that was the problem. The base is a clamp that's adjustable to fit the rim of the toilet tightly. Then there's a swing-up/down latch that clamps over the lid and seat keeping both of them down. You have to lift two buttons at the same time as you lift the latch, I found I could easily do it with one hand while holding a newborn, but my toddler, who could easily defeat all of our cabinet, drawer, and door locks just couldn't do it. Because I did it one handed the trick wasn't obvious. Well, I recommend this to all my friends, and will buy more for my new house 
This sleepsack is perfect. I was a little skeptical, and didn't know whether to buy the cotton one or this one. I am very happy with the quilted one. It is a fairly light cotton fabric, with quilting stitched into it. It is extremely soft and seems to be of awesome quality. After washing, it holds up wonderfully. My daughter has not arrived yet, but is expected to any day now. I feel good about putting her to sleep in this blanket to help keep the SIDS epidemic down. 
This is a very good item that every parent should have, an awsome gift to give and receive. I got it from a friend who got it as a gift from another one of our friends and honestly it is one of my favorite gifts ever. I take my baby a bath and then I put an onesie on her and then I put her in this sleep sack and I dont worry about her getting cold during the night because as she moves arround her crib the sack moves with her, now I dont have to check her during the night, and at the same time I am not afraid that she will cover her face with it. You will not regret this purchase 
This pad works very well on top of the dresser. We didn't want to buy a changing table and this made for a great alternative 
This booster seat is so convenient, small and easy to use. The pocket on the side is nice for a water bottle/snack. It's perfect for our 4-year-old Grand daughter and doesn't take up a lot of room in the car 
attractice, lightweight and comfy. grown-up enough for a kindergartener who would rather not have a booster at all 
I received this as a gift and I love it. My daughter is 6 months old now and this product was so helpful during sleep training as well as those nerve racking newborn days. I can "peek in on her" with out disturbing her. When she was learning to fall asleep on her own I was able to see that she was ok without running into her room and waking her all the way up everytime she let out a cry. The monitor works all over my house includding the basement and even out in the yard. The only thing that I don't like is that it will let out a loud static sound from time to time. It is also pricey...but if you can swing it GO FOR IT!! 
I have 2 Change Pad Covers. This and Munchkin. It's a world of difference so soft and fluffy this cover is. Though we have been washing this cover every other week (my baby is 3 mo old now), it still feels and looks like new. 
super soft, wish they made these for big people. heheheheeh very nice product, lovely color 
I just bought this changing pad cover for my baby who is expected this summer, and one of the things I was a little concerned about was if it would fit my existing changing pad that my son used. We have the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad, which seems to be a popular pad for people to use, and I was happy to find that it fits very nicely. The fabric does seem a little thin, but I will not know how well it will hold up, however, until the baby comes. Pottery Barn Kids also sells really soft chamois covers in a variety of colors for $19 a piece, and I have one of those for my new baby, too. The Pottery Barn one is a bit thicker. Once I test them both out I'll be sure to update this post and let you know what I think 
This thing is great. We use it to safely co-sleep (you can safely co-sleep; why most doctors in this country refuse to even discuss it when it REDUCES the risk of SIDS is beyond me). It works SO well, and you can just pull the baby down with the little pad she sleeps on, nurse her till she falls asleep lying down, and then pull the pad back up into the sleep nest, without waking her. That has been SO helpful!! I really recommend this to those thinking of co-sleeping. It's definitely a safer alternative than the adult mattress/pillows/blankets. We put it between us and the sides keep the pillows from getting near her face- perfect. 
I bought the lil snuggler sleep nest for my 3 month old daughter who did not like sleeping in her crib. She had been sleeping in an infant chair but we were concerned about her safety. I bought this hoping the closeness of the sides would make her feel more comfortable, like the chair. It worked perfectly. She is now 4 months old and sleeps through the night in her sleep nest. I even was able to prop it up so that it has a slight incline which she loves. I highly recommend this product 
My 4 month old received this dog as a gift for Christmas. It smells so lovely. He buries his head in its face to snuggle with it. I leave it in his crib until he falls asleep and then I remove it for the rest of the night. It has completely baby safe features which I really appreciate. The biggest surprise is that my 4 year old keeps sneaking it out of the baby's crib so she can sleep with it too. It is on her list for the next holiday 
i love the wireless option you can take it anyware i hear alot noise with the wire but i bought it to be wirless i use it wireless only there is no noise at all when used wirless i like it. it is what i have been looking fo 
I thought that because there were no buttons or batteries that my three year-old daughter would not enjoy it but I was wrong. She loves it!!! This doll goes every where that she does. I purchased this doll to help with potty training and it did the trick. This is a quality doll, that when you squeeze her tummy she can go potty. Feeding her the water is a little hard because you have to make sure you get the bottle in her mouth all the way. But she doesn't care if she spits the water up or if she actually goes potty. She also loves taking her into the bath tub too! Not as expensive as other dolls but well worth the money spent 
An excellent shopping experience in all aspects. Great item and excellent shipping. Very pleased. Thanks 
I initially bought the Rainforest bouncer but wasn't too happy with it. The hanging toys hung way too low and were made of a hard plastic. My baby got his foot stuck in them. I returned it for this one and my baby boy loves it. He smiled immediately at the puppy when I turned it on and watched it the entire time then went to sleep. I actually liked the idea of this bouncer because the puppy is more upbeat rather than soothing like the other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime. By the time he gets tired, the puppy and music shuts off and he sleeps peacefully in the vibrating chair. My ONLY minor complaint is I wish the ball on the toy bar cracked or squeaked. But overall, a terrific purchase! 
Not too much to say here. It's just a great bib. It's waterproof, and the pockets catch a lot of the stuff that normally ends up on the pants 
both my 4 year old and my little daughter 5 month old hate having their noses suctioned! My little girl has reflux and spits up a lot, due to that she always has quite some Milkbuggers up her nose and to add to that, she's teething like a Mammoth right now which makes her congested as well. First she wanted to sqirm away, but the hummingsound that comes from it and the nice Tune it plays destracted her! Since it vibrates quite a bit I first touch her cheek with it so she knows what to expect and she immidetly calmes down and today started even to giggle because it tickled her nose! The long and short tip are both very soft and have no sharp edges and the suction is very gentle. Yes, I do agree that it won't suck crusties out of the nose but even with a bulb, hard stuff should be soaked for a couple of seconds with a squirt of saline up the nose to soften it. Once you do that the bigger buggers will come out with the big tip! I personally find the Bulbs to invasive and the aspirators in Hospital pretty strong, so strong that not even the stuff will use them unless the Babys oxygen drops due to stuffiness in the nose! I KNOW I just spent 1 week in the hospital in February with my duaghter due to RSV, and yes those aspirators there shouldn't be used unless there is no other way (but even there they use always saline first to soften the stuff and then use the suction) Oh, by the way, the Aspirator comes with a handy little sack to store the tips and the easy to take apart and clean Aspirator! sure, the Suction is not as strong as the Hospital one but the Hospital cannot be used as often as you want to, this one is gentle enough and even fun for the little ones while giving them relieve and can be used as needed it is that gentle! That's why it gets 5 stars from me 
This paid for itself the first morning my son couldn't nurse because he was so stuffy. Two minutes later with no screaming he was all clear - and I didn't have to pin his hands down or anything. It is also much easier to clean than a rubber one 
I am a first time parent of a 4 month old. I was surprised to learn that babies can't clear their own noses until they are about 3 years old. I tried using the manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated and I would have limited success clearing his nose. It usually took several attempts to get into the nostril and once there, I was only able to get good suction about 1/3 of the time. Maybe others have better luck than me but these are my stats. I ordered the NasalClear about a week ago. I was concerned that the vacuum might be too strong for little noses or that the tips would be too invasive. The vacuum is very gentle. I prefer the shorter, stouter tip as it seems less likely to go too far up the nostril. Either tip is certainly shorter than the one on the manual bulb. The suction, while being gentle, is very effective at cleaning the nostril. I was surprised by how much a little nostril could hold. That being said, the NasalClear comes with a collecion cup that has a max fill line on it that seems absurdly large. I have yet to get even a drop into the chamber (there is quite a bit of storage space in the tubes leading to the chamber that does get filled) so I can't even imagine filling it. I don't find the music feature to be very important. It's a great product that works well and doesn't irritate my baby. So far, there hasn't been a tear caused by NasalClear--which is a huge improvement over the manual bulb 
We have a very large opening between our kitchen and living room, and this was the only barricade with a gate that we could find. We went ahead and bought it, and it was fairly easy to install. Pros: 1) You can angle it so that it custom fits your space. You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions. 2) It has a gate, so you don't have to continuously step over it or take it down. 3) Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one. 4) The gate slowly closes after you walk through it (but it doesn't latch shut, FYI). Cons: 1) Although the gate can be opened with one hand, it's not the easiest (you have to move a button and then lift up, not a huge deal, though). 2) Its also not the easiest to close (have to lift up and then push down). 3) It's wall mounted (not pressure mounted), so it leaves holes in the wall. Overall, I would recommend it 
You can see in one of the pictures above I needed to cover a 20ft area to keep the dog out of my young son's play area, he's only five months old. I purchased two of these gates, connected them together and voila, you have a ready made wall. The look is great and goes with any decor. Unlike the one review below I have had no problems with it coming out of the wall. You have to have it anchored into a stud just as you do with anything you screw into the wall. I have ran into it a few times not realizing the gate was latched and it didn't budge. I feel good knowing that if I have to step out of the room for a minute my son is safe. Everything was easy to install and connecting the two gates together is a breeze. I recommend this gate to everyone. If you want peace of mind buy it. And if you have a babies'r'us around you they sell them there 
We needed to gate off our basement stairs but it is a large opening and there aren't two walls directly across from eachother that we could put a gate between. This gate is the perfect solution because we could install in an "L" shape. It works great, the gate is easy to open (but not so easy that my son can do it), it is stable and sturdy and I no longer have to worry about my son climbing the stairs. It is a nice khaki brown color that actually matches our wall color perfectly. I like that it's not your typical white metal "prison bars" gate. 
We have a nine foot opening into the kitchen, which is entirely off limits from my daughter. We have a large amount of small items in there that could easily be choked on, besides the inherent danger of a kitchen. So my daughter has to be kept out! This gate was one of two that would span the distance and this was the more affordable. My husband installed it quickly (within about ten minutes of getting home), adjusted it to the size we needed, and voila! My daughter is turning one this month and the gate looks like it did when we bought it months ago. Even when she puts her full body weight against the mesh, trying to "push" her way through, it doesn't give--not the mesh, the seams, the hardware, anything. I was worried about the bar below the gate being annoying or tripped over but it is so low to the ground that it has never been an issue. The latch on the gate takes a bit to get used to, but the gate stays in place even if the latch is dropped in the cradle and not snapped in. Love it 
This Bundleme Wasabi is wonderful!! It is so convenient, I would not want to be without it for any baby. The inside of it is very soft and comfortable. It keeps my 6 month old daughter toasty warm which is much needed here in Chicago. I like it so much more than having to put on her bulky coat everywhere we go. I just lay her in this, slip on a hat, zip up the Wasabi and go! I highly recommend this if you live somewhere where the temps go below the 30s 
Although expensive, the JJ Cole Bundle Me is a great investment. I receive a lot of compliments on the one I use for our daughter. No more worrying about scraping baby blankets along dirty cars as you maneuver in the garage with the car seat. Our daughter appreciates having less bulk in her seat as well! The Bundle Me is the best quality of car seat covers you'll find. Buying the cheap brands only costs more in the end when you buy the authentic Bundle Me. My only warning: NEVER buy from Target- their return policy is meant to trick the consumer. Even with receipt and tags, their merchandise will not be accepted after 90 days. Buy your Bundle Me from Amazon or the JJ Cole website. Trust me, I've registered for my wedding and baby with Target. We've lost over $500.00 due to their ridiculous return policy. Learn from my mistakes 
I purchased this item for my 6 month old and I love it. It replaces the need for a jacket and I can unzip the Bundleme when we are out shopping to keep my little one from getting too hot. I still put a hat on him when its very cold out but I do not have a problem with the wind blowing the top flap off (I have seen that complaint in other reviews) as my car seat has a canopy and that has never been an issue. The material is very soft on the inside and my baby is very comfortable in it. I would highly recommend this product 
We love the Urban Bundle Me!! It is a wonderful product and I would highly recommend it! I was so frustrated with the blanket falling off the car seat all the time and this is the perfect solution!! We live in California so the Urban Bundle Me was a better option than the traditional one (which I have also but use in the stroller) it keeps my son nice and warm and shielded from rain and wind. The only negative I think is the zipper which could be better quality. It fit my Peg Prego Car Seat perfectly. 
I have lived in cold climates for each of my kids, and have hated the dreaded bundle up and squeeze into the carseat routine. It makes traveling so much easier now that I can leave baby without a big bunting and know she'll be warm and cozy. The zippers are great - almost 6 months of use every single day and not a problem. I have washed it several times and it looks like new and has held up wonderfully. I have used it on windy days, when I was a bit sceptical about it being windproof, and it stood the test. Moving it from the carseat to the stroller is a sinch with the velcro closures in the back. I don't have any cons to list this has been such a great item for us 
this bunting is soft on the inside and like a breaker on the outside. it's well constructed and a good buy for a newborn. it looks and feels better than other carriers out there 
Great booster seat. It is exceptionally safe and sturdy. Easily fits into our small car. My daughter seems to be very comfortable in it, and naps during long drives. I love that it folds up and comes in a carrying case - great for airline travel. I highly recommend this seat 
I did a lot of research on everything I purchased for my sons room. I am a first time mom and was very hesitant to buy anything because of price I wanted quality on a budget. We really wanted a crib that had a drawer at the bottom for ALL of the blankets we had been given but could not find anything that we both like and was affordable. I LOVE this crib. We ordered it and was told it would be delivered in two weeks, we got it in 4 days. It was in excellent condition and took just over an hour to assemble the entire thing. It was so simple and looks great. I feel bad for those of you who had a bad experience but ours was great. I suggest any parent looking for a great looking crib at a great price to buy this one 
We ordered this crib on-line from Babies"R"Us/Amazon and we like it a lot! Not only that it arrived one week earlier than the estimated arrival time but it also came in a very good condition. I had read the reviews before we ordered the crib and realized that we were taking a risk as quite a few customers were complaining about problems with trasportation or serious damages due to poor packaging. Our crib arrived in an almost perfect condition. The only reason I did not give it 5 star rating is because one piece that we're going to need when we convert to toddler bed has a chip in it; it is not too bad though. Also, assembling the crib was not a problem at all for my husband and one of our friends. Following the instructions, they were able to assemble in about 1 and 1/2 hour. As I said before, we're very satisfied with our selection, now we're just waiting for our baby girl (due March 21, 2006) to see how she likes it.   
It took us forever to decide on a highchair and we actually took our then 6 month-old on shopping trips to see which one he responded to the best. We found this one to be the most versatile and the least likely to catch his fingers in the tray. I also like that it has a five-point harness. I see that a lot of people had problems with their babies reaching the tray. Our son is very tall, so this wasn't a problem for us. I also find it easy to clean, the straps come off and are machine washable and I use a damp cloth to wipe it down. It folds up nicely to go to grandma's house and it's nice to have so many levels of adjustment so that we can feed from the couch if necessary. The chair leans back for those times that he eats from a bottle or wants to snooze in his chair. It wheels easily from dining room to kitchen to living room. I know that it's pricey, but it supports kids up to 50 lbs, so I plan to use it for a while and it's durable enough that I'm sure someone else will get plenty of use out of it after we're done. 
I had the eddie bauer chair and my son hated it- he is six months old. I returned it and purchased this chair. I love this chair. I can't believe how many people complain about cleaning it- I purchased the clorox everywhere spray that is safe for babies and tht is it- just wipe clean. 
I have purchased several diaper bags and received several at my shower. As a person who loves pocketbooks, I'm horribly picky about any bag. But a diaper bag especially should be functional and stylish. The COMBI urban sling is just that. At the time of this writing, I've only had it a week, so I can't speak to it's durability. What you can't see in the pictures on this site are the many pockets in the bag. The front flap closes messenger-style via velcro. There's a zipped pocket which spans the width of the front flap inside the front flap. Upon opening the front flap velcro, there are two pen holders and two compartments/pockets which will fit a wallet, or checkbook or even diapers if that's where you want to put them. There is a zipped compartment on the side of the bag which holds one bottle. This is the only drawback; that only one bottle can go in the insulated compartment. However, in the part of the bag which is the deepest, there are two deep compartments and one zippered compartment on top of a spacious inside. The bottle thing was remedied for me by putting another bottle on the inside compartment in a ziploc bag ( to keep the temperature). The shoulder is heavily padded in the middle of the bag, which is a joy on my shoulders. And the key holding section is convenient as well. On the back of the bag is a compartment which holds a large changing pad. This is one of the best features as the changing pad itself isn't bulky and taking up oo gobs of diaper bag space. I took this bag to the hardest possible test site: the suburban mall. This was his first trip there and I was able to pack two nine ounce bottles, wipes, diapers, a change of clothes, his medicines, disposable changing pads, a receiving blankie (albeit thin), my wallet and essentials and still had pockets in the bag that were empty. With the rubberized shoulder pad I didn't have to worry about the bag falling off of my shoulder as it rubbed against my shirt. (I know I'm not the only one who is sick of readjusting bags on their shoulder over and over). And the way it is designed, it leaned flat on my hip instead of jutting out. Made turning those store corners with a stroller much less difficult. And the bag came in super handy on his doctor's visit yesterday in the middle of heavy rain. The material seems waterproof. I really love this bag. As I'm on maternity leave now, I am using it strictly for the baby. However, as someone who works in social services and is often at meetings and in the field in neighborhoods, I can see using this bag transitioning to work upon my return. If it holds up, it also seems the perfect bag for those theme park trips. Overall it was money well spent. 
I love this diaper bag. First, it doesn't look like a diaper bag. It can pass for a purse and looks very sporty. I don't feel like a frumpy mom while carrying this. Also, it carries quite a bit without looking bulky. I regulary carry wipes, diapers for my infant and my potty-training toddler, plus at least one change of clothes for each child in the two larger compartments. I still have room for my keys, wallet, cell phone, sun glasses, and a hair brush in the two inner zippered pockets. I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap needs a little more padding. But, overall, it is a great diaper bag. 
I bought this for my second son's infant carseat before he was born. My first son always had a slumpy head in his carseat and the rainbow shaped head supports were useless. This works great. It did a wonderful job of keeping his head supported even when we were comming home from the hospital and I am still using it today, 5 mos. later. I wish I would have had one for my older son, and I would definately recommend it 
I purchased the Twilight Turtle as a Christmas gift for my 27 month old grandson and he says "I Like it!". He asks for it every single night at bedtime. His favorite color is the amber, which is almost impossible to see, but he likes to hold the turtle and aim the stars at his pj's and the wall behind his bed - so it works for him. While he does not use the toy as it was meant to be used (sitting on a dresser so that the ceiling/wall is illuminated) and prefers to hold onto the turtle and aim it like a flashlight, he really enjoys it, and that's the whole point! 
Our two grandsons, 4 years and 18-months, are completely in love with the stars and color choices within this hard-shelled plush turtle! It has become a bedtime routine to star gaze with O-ma first, and then quietly and individually afterward in their own room. Overnight stays are even more frequent! Because it shows real constellations it will be a "Grow-with-Me" item. The CD is lovely 
I bought these for my 3 and 6 year old nieces and they loved them. They are afraid to sleep with the lights off and now they use the turtle to light the room until they fall asleep. It's great because it turns off in 15 minutes by itself. They loved it 
LOVE THE TWILIGHT TURTLE. MY 2 1/2YR OLD LOVED HER ROOM AND CRIB, BUT LATELY DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SLEEP STATING IT WAS TOO SCARY... WE GOT THE TURTLE AND EVER SINCE SHE GOES AND STAYS IN BED NO PROBLEM... IT'S LIKE A BEATIFUL NIGHT-TIME SKY IN HER ROOM.. GREAT FEATURE IS THAT IT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY IN 45 MINS.... 
My 2 year old loves this turtle! I can't wait to show her the constellations! The only thing that I do not like is the amber colored bulb...the stars aren't quite bright enough 
We were having trouble getting the 10 month to go to bed peacefully and the turtle has made a big difference. By watching the stars on the ceiling he is calmer and just falls asleep. The CD helps with this also 
My son's Godmother gave this to him for his 4th birthday and it has become his favorite toy. It's a stuffed animal, nightlight and toy all in one. He turns it on every night with great discussion given to what color his stars should be. I would never have purchased this for my son, but now I will recommend it for anyone with children in the 3-5 age range. 
I bought this video monitor system right after we moved into a new house when my son (with autism) was 4. Because his bedroom was on a different floor, I was repeatedly going to check on him at night to make sure he was okay and still in his room! I mounted the camera for the widest possible angle -- near the ceiling in a corner of his room -- and now I can check on him all night long. (I leave the volume on very low, so I can hear if he yells, but he doesn't wake me up if he's just playing or drawing.) As parents of autistic kids know, our little ones are often very clever escape artists, so having the reassurance this monitor offers is fabulous. 
At first we thought that an audio monitor would work out for us. Then we found out our son had reflux and we had a scary incident with him choking. Soon after we received the hand held color monitor as a gift and we were able to sleep at night knowing we could peak at the monitor all night if we wanted to. Our floors are very noisy, so sneaking into his room to check on him would wake him most of the time. To us, this is a must have and I highly recommend. This product has worked out perfect, I can not think of a negative. Even though we received this as a gift, I would pay for the $ for it 
We recently ordered this monitor and really like it. It has wonderful color during the day and is clearly illuminated up to about 8 feet away from the camera at night. We have a 900 MHz 2.4 GHz phones in our home and have not had any interference problems with the monitor. We have an older two-story home and the nursery is on the top floor. I can do laundry in the basement or cook in the first floor kitchen and both the sound and picture are clear. I especially like the time-out feature that turns off the display screen after a few minutes but leaves the audio monitor on when the monitor is operating on its battery. The display is turned on by a big button on top so if you hear something that you want to check out, just push the button and the room is in view. It's very nice. The monitor has a belt clip and also a flip-out stand so that it is stable on a counter or wherever. I would recommend this product without reservation. 
I've used these for two babies now and have used the milk after 6mo in deep freeze. They are great most of the time. I freeze about 10-12oz in each bag (yes, they say no more than 6oz, it's a myth). 12 is the maximum I found tho. The trick is to make sure there is no air. It won't leak b/c the bag will expand, unlike plastic storage containers. I use the straight edge of a table, push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out. Don't worry if a little leaks out b/c it has a double zipper. Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly. After it's frozen, I put 8-10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer. It's easier to organize them this way in deep freeze. The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen, the plastic nicks easily if you drop it, scrape it against something, etc (as with all frozen containers). Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they've improved. Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks. Lansinoh customer service is great and will replace them if you encounter leaky bags 
This walker is very easy to put together. It doesn't need any tools to assemble it, just to open the battery compartment (small flat head screwdriver). The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The walker itself looks cheap but actually I was surprised how sturdy it is once put together. I do have to say that the washable seat for this is a little tough snapping into place so I won't want to remove it much to wash it... still that is a small price to pay for safety. the front wheels are casters which rotate in a complete 360. the back wheels jsut go forward or backwards... this is a safety feature, as are the traction strips on the underside of the walker. The baby will only be able to move backwards at first, but with a little time, s/he will be cruising all over. I am a little concerned about the activity toys on the tray. From the reviews, it looks like baby may bang her mouth a little. If that is the case, it will take me 2 minutes to detatch the toys and save it for later when she has more control. Also, the sound for the toys is actually not bad. Most toys have 2 volume settings; loud and louder... this one (in my opinion)actually has 2 real volue conrols... soft and medium.Still If I ever get annoyed at the noise, I can turn it off by flipping the switch... or just let the battery run out. the worst part of the whole thing is adjsuting it to different height levels... I found it easier to turn the walker upside down and adjsut it that way... still, my thumbs will be bruised for days for all the pressure it took to adjust. Hope this helps... definately worth the $40 
our five month old son took right to it! he immediately began pushing himself around and within an hour he figured out how to direct it to where he wanted to go. this is a great product!! this is injection moulded plastic so there is no paint to flake off. perhaps he is reviewing the wrong item 
We purchased this walker for our son because he loves Elmo and Sesame Street. We love it! Our son loves pushing the "musical buttons" and spinning the red circle in the middle. It glides easily and is a breeze to get our son in and out of. The cover also comes off easily for washing, if necessary. I'm not sure what "Papa Bear Paul" was talking about, because there is no paint on our walker and there is no way our son's hand can get caught... Even if your little one doesn't enjoy Sesame Street as much as ours, you will love this walker! 
These placemats have saved my oak table from getting scratched by forks etc. They are great for catching food before it hits the floor or my childs lap. Love them. I am now ordering another set to have on hand! 
I purchased this, because my sister-in-law had one. I thought it was great when we went out to dinner. It is the right size. Not to big where it takes the whole table and not to small where the baby doesnt use it. The flexablitity of the maerial makes it very easy to take along 
Our baby grabs and throws stuff on the floor. So it was difficult to feed him and ourselves when we went out to restaurants. The TinyDiner sticks right on the table and allows baby to eat off of it, letting us eat in peace! Its pretty easy to clean, I run it under water in the sink and wipe it..I make sure its dry before I stick it in the diaper bag. Love this item 
We love this item and people always stop us to ask where we got it! It is a little hard to clean, but I feel better using a reuseable product and taking the effort to wash it than I would if I used disposable plastic placemats. A few wonderful waitstaff folks have willingly cleaned it for us in restaurants. We only use this when we're out. We often wet the suction cups to help them stick. My 18 month old can rip it off, but that tells me he's done eating! The surface is also a bit clingy, so his toddler trick of flinging his arms to scatter food is a little tougher for him! This is a great product and won major daughter-in-law points for me with my germaphobe mother-in -law 
I use these mats with my 2 1/2 yr. old twins at my dining room table. They keep the mess off wood and are easy to clean. You can also travel easily with them. 
You never know what is on the table you feed your kids off of. I mean, yes they may wipe them down, but else have they cleaned with that same rag??? We have never had a problem with the suction cups not sticking. It fits in our diaper bag just fine.(its about the same size as a bottle, maybe an inch or two longer) When we are done, we dump any solids onto our plate. Roll it up and take it home. It rinses off with great ease. We love ours 
After using the Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat for 4 months, I purchased two more mats. This is the best seat protector I found for several reasons: - It doesn't smell. I had to return everything I had bought at Babies R Us due to a heavy rubber smell that never went away even after airing the products for a week. - It's made of two pieces so it can be used in stages. Use the bottom piece only when using a rear-facing infant seat, or both pieces when using a front-facing car seat. - It's made of two pieces so it fits any height car seat. I have a Britax car seat which is really tall. The other seat protectors did not reach all the way to the top of my SUV's seat, so the car seat rested directly on the leather, but with this seat protector, I could raise the back piece as high as I needed it to fully protect my SUV's seat. - It's thick enough that even after months of use, there's no marks on the SUV's leather seats. - It has indentations in the bottom portion to accommodate car seats using the latch system. A note on the height issue: A friend of mine bought the Duomat 2-In-1 Car Seat Mat, which he found to be very nice as well and it did not smell. He had to return it however due to the fact that the mat was not as high as the seat of his Honda Odyssey, and his Britax Marathon car seat at the very top rested directly on the Honda seat with no protector in between 
I have had this stroller for about 7 months. I love it! No complaints and the pattern is way cuter in person! It has everything you need at a great price. (Compare to Graco Spree or Metrolite). I really like that it takes multiple carseat brands (my sisters have actually borrowed it and they have a different infant carrier), has a parent tray, and child tray with toys 
We just recently purchased this stroller as we were traveling and our other stroller just broke......I looked at several different ones the store had to offer and thought this would be the best. It offered all the features we were looking for, reclining seat, storage area, cup holders, lightweight and compact and all for a good price. So far I am very happy with it. Our son loves the toy bar and the cup holder. It is easy to assemble, easy to steer and adjust the seat. It folds up with just one hand. Right now, I love it ! 
This is a good quality organizer, at a good value. I appreciate the neutral colors, and I have had no problems using the velcro fasteners to affix this to the changing table. The middle compartments could be a little larger, but overall this is a great way to keep some essentials close at hand without cluttering up the changing table 
I love this organizer. I keep diapers, wipes, cream, pacifiers, recieving blankets socks, and a rattle and book on it to occupy baby during changes. it isnt meant to hold very heavy things, so i put those things in baskets on the shelves of the table. it holds the things you need though and i like the plain color, one less annoyingly bright thing that i am trying to put in a unisex neautral room.i have had no problems with the straps like other readers have. well worth the money, great timesaver and also a great babyshower gift 
This item is so handy. Now I have every thing I need right at my finger tips. I placed mine off the end of the changing table. I have had no trouble with it staying in place using the velcro straps. It could have been a bit larger. I would definetly recomend this item 
I went back and forth before I finally decided to add this to my baby registry. I received it as a gift and I'm so glad that I registered for it. True, the velcro isn't too strong, which makes it slip if alot of heavy items are placed on it. However, I used the strategy that another reviewer used and tied it to the crib with some pretty ribbon and it works wonderfully. I have powder, lotion, baby oil, vaseline, some shoes, as well as a package of diapers and a few more items stored in it and it is holding up fine. I think this organizer can be a very useful and convenient way to keep the much needed items close at hand, especially if you are lacking storage space. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone and I'm so glad that I did finally register for it. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have to make an adjustment, being using the ribbons instead of the velcro that it came with. Otherwise, I have no other complaints 
I bought this item a little sceptical afetr reading some of it's negative reviews. I thought it was going to be unsturdy. It is light weight but it carried everything perfectly. I put my baby's diaper in it along with a bunch of her little bathroom things. The velcro straps were a little too short for my crib which I thought was a negative at first, but I had some pretty ribbon and I tied it to the end of my crib using the little loop-holes in the back. It gave it the prettiest effect. I would recommed this over anything. Everything is just a reach away 
I love this lamp shade. It is really cute matches perfectly with everything! The cost is high for just a shade, but worth it 
My husband and I couldn't agree on a theme for the bedroom. He wanted sports and I wanted animals. I didn't like most of the sports sets out there b/c they were all dark blue and red. I am so happy that I found this set! The colors are light and babyish and it looks GREAT in the nursery. I have also bought accesories and it really pulls the room together. They huge bonus of this set is the fantastic price on [...]. All other sites have the same exact set listed at over $[...]!! 
I love this bedding. My husband picked it out, and he did a great job! There are all different textures on the bumper and comforter! Really cute! We also bought all the accessories to go along (except the mobile and lamp) The nursery looks adorable! I am very pleased with our purchase! 
Great! The sounds are perfect, my baby loves them all especially the whales. I love the fact that it has a volume dial and two choices of time. Small enough to pack and bring with you anywhere. Highly recommend 
We just purchased this item for new grandbaby that is on the way. When my daughter-in-law received it she called me and played all the sounds to me so that I could hear them. Soooo cute and soothing--I think I want one for myself! Great soother 
This little lamb has saved us from suffering through sleepless nights. Our baby loves it, especially the whale sounds. Really works to calm her and soothe her to sleep almost immediately 
In my experience, using a bib without a pocket is pretty useless. My daughter always makes a big mess when eating and a pocket is mandatory. I love this one because it is soft enough to be comfortable and has a pocket that is actually firm enough and large enough to do what it needs to. I love that the entire thing is hard plastic, without any fabric--all you have to do is wipe and go. No staining or mildewing or anything like that. We have 2, one to use and one to spare and that's all we need. The mechanism for clasping is very easy to hook and unhook (for mom or dad), but is secure enough that your little one won't easily pull it off. It's also adjustable for little necks and bigger necks alike. We've used several types of pocketed bibs in the past, but now that we've found this one we will never need another kind. In my opinion, this is the perfect bib for messy little eaters 
I bought these for my twin boys after about two weeks of washing a mountain of "regular" bibs. I started using them when they were about 7 months and have used nothing else since. Now that they are ten months and self feeding, they have saved me from doing tons of extra laundry. Their clothes rarely have any stains. I love that I can just rinse them after each meal and either put them in the dishwasher or hand wash them at the end of the day. They make mealtime so much easier. One of my boys loves to rip off his bibs, but he can't budge this one!! They also love to fish out any dropped food from the trough and try again to get it into their little mouths. Everywhere I take the boys I get such positive feedback on them. 
This bib has changed mealtime for the better! I tried all sorts of fancy bibs because I thought this bib would be uncomfortable for my tiny baby. Boy was I wrong! After the initial fuss she now loves this bib. She is comfortable and clean! The bib catches every drop of food, water and her super staining vitamin drops! FYI Even this fantastic bib can't shield you from unexpected baby sneezes during feedings! I stained and ruined so many cloth bibs before I finally took this out of the box and now I only use this one! Plus one in my car for on the go feedings! More colors please Baby Bjorn 
Always where it needs to be, durable, easy to clean. My daughter used it as a part of a five-tiered food buffering system: plate, tray, bib, hands, and cheeks, all of which seemed vital somehow. If anything, she probably liked it better than we did, and we liked it a lot. It was always a bit of a letdown to get out somewhere and realize we only had one of the terry or soft vinyl kind 
This thing is great. Catches most of the drips and spills from our 2 year old. Other bibs keep the stuff off of the clothes, this keeps a lot of it off the floor too. They've redesigned the latching mechanism to keep it from catching kid's hair and to make it easier to open 
My son is now self-feeding, so I was looking for a bib that would catch his mistakes but be easy to clean after each meal. Although this bib is a bit stiff, it does a great job of catching every single thing he drops. And, it's easy to clean - I just wash it along with the dishes after each meal and it's ready to go for the next meal. 
My first son took to breastfeeding like a champ from the get-go. I never experienced sore nipples with him. My second son is a whole different story though. For some reason my second son just didn't want to open his mouth wide enough to get a good latch on, so that made for excruciatingly sore nipples for me for about the first two weeks of nursing. It was torture - pure torture. A nurse at the hospital gave me these gel patches to help with my sore nipples and I must say, I don't know what I would have done with out them (I probably would have given up on breastfeeding). I tried the nipple cream and that did help a bit, but these gel patches are really what made breastfeeding manageable for me. I healed faster wearing them than I did with the nipple cream. If you put the patches in the fridge for a couple of minutes then put them on they feel really great. This is a wonderful product and I attribute them to getting over that huge breastfeeding hurtle for the first two weeks. 
The unit(s) work very well together and monitors the newborn's every move. We can walk around the house and yard and still have our child's safety foremost. Great produc 
We purchased this monitor to use in our 2 year old daughter's room. We were intrigued by this product since we were able to communicate with her without going to her room (she likes to try to get us to come to her room when she doesn't want to go to sleep). That was our only reason to buy this monitor. Now, it's our favorite (out of 3 different brands). There is no background noise/static like we had with her old monitor. It also has a rechargeable battery, so both receivers are charged and ready to go whenever and wherever you want to use it. It's very easy to use and quite clear. I plan on buying another one for our son when he gets a little older. 
My Wife and I had twins recently and I went looking (about 3 hours of internet searching and reading reviews) at all kinds of different nursery monitors. I even looked at some costing over 500 dollars with built in wallmounts, ect. Pretty much every thing I read said try this one. Well they were right. Rechargable batteries. Good clear signal even between multi-floors. Durable hand sets with a easy to use switch between the base (the babies room) and the other hand set. Easy to use. durable and reliable. Good volumn control. Good response from manufacture and from Amazon when a switch went bad. Can't ask for more than that even if it cost twice what I paid. I strongly recommend this set and product. I have used others and they can't touch this one. My babies and more importantly my wife's emotional well being were a serious consideration on finding something that would make them feel safe and in communication. After 3 months of continous use, I can't imagine a better choice. It even allows us as adults to have quiet time casue we know we can hear everything even the slightest wimper. Do yourself a favor and buy this. Jay Saldan 
This Baby monitor is working very well for us. I looked a long time for the imho simple features of a) three units - 1 each for mom, baby and dad b) the ability to talk to each of them. The Connection is good, very faint noise, if you crank up the volume. Downsides: A little annoying is the loud beep you hear before speaking. And the rechargable battery (on the two parents units) don't hold very long. After a couple of months of use, we have to recharge them now every three days - we use them about 4 hours a day. The baby unit has no battery, but I don't think that's a problem. Still, the best monitor I could find : 
It's not the clearest or the easiest to use, but it does work. You can tell the difference between the baby and other sounds. It's pretty sensitive and we've been happy with it. I don't think you can go wrong for the money. If I were grading it by value for the money, I'd give it a higher rating. But I'm rating it based on what it does over others I've seen or heard about 
With the new (Summer, 2007) law in Washington that extends the booster seat years to age 8, I needed to purchase a new booster for my older daughter. She likes this bright red seat. It's comfortable, and she's eased back into booster-seat riding without protest. The seat was easy to set up, and was in the back seat of our Volvo in minutes. This review would be 5 stars if Graco had come up with a new concept for booster seats--ones that are soft, not hard plastic, perhaps, and quite inexpensive. Something that would encourage everyone who might drive a kid around to get one or--or maybe even car manufacturers to include one per seat as standard. Something that won't soon be a big pile in the landfill. With this seat, Graco has provided a solid option for the current design standard. But they haven't innovated 
My son is 3 1/2 and this is the FIRST seat of his that I was able to assemble and get into the car without one ounce of help from my husband. All others left me frustrated and baffled. I have overcome my fear of kids seats with this one! Next you'll find me out back putting up the swing set all on my own ;-) Loooove it 
Excellent product and Target is very fast. My grandaughter especially likes this style of seat 
This seat is so easy to put together, place in the vehicle and strap a child in to, it is definitely worth every penny. Safety ratings on this seat are great. It is also convenient that, when the child is old enough to move on to a booster without a backrest, the backrest is removable. Our daughter loves the cupholders for snacks and drinks. She also loves that she can climb in and out of the seat by herself, which is good for her self-confidence as she grows up. We use this seat between 2 cars and it is easily removed and replaced with a simple slide of the seat belt. The seat is even color-coded to show where the belt should be placed across the shoulder and the waist. Definitely a great product 
My 3 4 year olds absolutely love their new "big boy" seats with their own cup holders. The seat gives a really nice support system using the in car seat belts. The head, neck and shoulders are all supported nicely. I would absolutely recommend this item to someone who is ready to upgrade from the baby seats 
This seat is easy to secure in the car, has a high back for additional support, two arm rest for comfort and two cup holders for convience. Test show this to be one of the top seats manufactured. I give it a thumbs up 
We bought an earlier model of this seat when my son was 4, and we are still using it as he turns 8. We have one in each of our two cars, and we keep a third out on the west coast for when we are there traveling. Unlike the other review currently posted for this seat, we have really loved the cupholders - there is room for them to pop out in our car, so they are kept out all the time. They work for water bottles, crayons, little plastic toys, etc. It has held up well to abuse, adjusts to different sizes, looks sporty, and generally gets a thumbs up. 
I have not been pleased with high chairs in the past- they were bulky and took up way too much space. This high chair went right on one of my dining room chairs- no more tripping over the awkwardly large, inconvienent high chair. This high chair is easy to clean and it reclines for the infant who can't quite sit up yet. It turns into a booster so when my baby gets bigger he can literally "eat at the table." I highly recommend this for all!! 
We could not have asked for a better high chair than this one. We have a small house and not a lot of room in the kitchen area so this is perfect for us. It attaches great to one of our kitchen table chairs. I love the fact that it reclines too. My son can hold his own bottle so I can recline him after he eats his food and then give him his bottle while I get things done. I totally recommend this high chair to everyone. 
There are many good things about this product: It is easy to clean (wipe it with a cloth to clean), it is small, it reclines, it has a 5-point harness, the tray is dish washer safe, it is sturdy, and it grows with your child. After using a more expensive product (twice the price) that was very difficult to clean I am thrilled to find this highchair. I only wished i had discovered it 2 1/2 years ago with my son. 
I live in a relatively small townhome, and my son's baby gear has taken over most of the space. Between activity mats, jumpers, swings, and kicking contraptions, I couldn't bring myself to buy a full-size high chair. I actually bought a Bumbo Seat, hoping I could use this instead of a high chair, but that didn't work out too well. So I was pretty excited when I saw this high chair and read good reviews. I'm happy to report that I love this this high chair! The vinyl seat is pretty plush and looks comfortable. He actually looks like he's sitting on a little throne when he's in it. I strapped it onto a barstool, and it feels very secure. The vinyl seat, along with the rest of the chair material, is easy to clean. The tray says dishwasher safe, but my dishwasher is too small to accommodate it. It doesn't seem to be the highest quality chair, meaning some of the functions aren't as easy to use as you might hope, like the reclining seat and the tray, but it wouldn't deter me from buying it again. It was only $50, so I wouldn't expect it to be any different. It's also very portable, which isn't a normal expectation of a high chair. Overall, I'm very happy with this product 
Very light-weight. Only 8.4 lbs. Comes with a shoulder strap for easy lifting. And very easy to fold/unfold. My daughter is 5 yrs old and she fits nicely in it. And it manouvers smoothly with her added weight. We purchased this stroller to use on a Disney vacation. Rental stroller in Disney is $10.00 per day. This we can use for many more vacations. Best stroller we ever purchased. You will be pleased, if you purchase this stroller. 
This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often. We have a more expensive, larger, "safer" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one. Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground. We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel. The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes. There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get. The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try. The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new. We should get sales rep compensation, because no one really had these in Paris and all our friends saw ours and got one too 
Our son is almost 16 months old and we have been using these sippy cups for about 10 months now. We have never had them leak, mold, spouts push through or anything! I suggest reading the directions before tossing these sippy cups in the trash. I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of "hype" just because they failed to read directions. As for the complaints about mold and sour milk...that's just gross. Wash the sippy cup after it's used. I'm sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer...not Avent's fault! Anyway, as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean...OK, maybe for the first few times because they are new; but they WILL get more pliable. I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison, NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so (same for nipples with Avent bottles). They do wear out...especially if you're using the same two or three sippy cups every day. I just bought (and tried) the "sport spout" and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out, our son has no problem with that spout, either. No leaks so far. All in all, read the directions and you will see the leaks disappear like MAGIC! Good luck 
I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces. The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums. I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet 
These are so handy to throw in the diaper bag. They have everything you need to eat out with your little one in a compact package 
They came very quickly and were what I expected. Thank you seller 
The service by target is very good. Item arrived in good condition and quite fast. The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged. It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor. 
I was given this walker from a friend who's child progressed so fast he skipped the walker stage. When I brought it home my son instantally fell in love with it for the shear fact that he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it. It is a little basic in design and I have found that the toys do not stay put for very long they are not made very well and are very basic. My main problem with this walker is that it is a pain in the butt to put away it doesn't fold up easily and it doesn't stay folded for very long. I also am having problems ajusting the height of the walker my friend put it all the way down and now I can't get it to go back up so my son's is basically standing all by himself when he is in it (which I am not complaining about) 
Our child is still to short at 7 months age for her feet to touch the ground, but until she can, she enjoys sitting and playing in it 
I purchased this walker for my 7 month old daughter and she loves it. Great for the price. My only complaints were that it was kind of a pain to put together, pieces didnt snap together easily, and second the toys were a little too far away for her to reach at first 
My granddaughter, age 7 mos., is enjoying her new-found freedom and I think this product is well worth the money. The folding, take along, feature is great as they live quite a distance from me and this makes the walker easier to pack. 
We bought this walker for my son when he was about 8 months old. He immediately loved it and always wanted to be in it. This walker is so easy for him to turn corners and move all around the house in. It keeps him busy, and happy, for hours. The tray on the front is also great to put snacky-type foods for him to eat while he is in it as well as his sippy cup to drink from when he needs it. I would reccommend this walker to anyone with a baby, especially a baby that really wants to move 
We are very happy with this dresser, especially considering the reasonable price when looking at other dressers. It looks beautiful with the matching Ellis crib and was easy to assemble. Although the drawers may not be sturdy enough to last for 20 years of wear and tear, this is perfect for nursery furniture and we plan to use it for all our future children's nurseries. Fortunately we didn't have any scratches or dents with this dresser, but Simplicity had good customer service when we needed a replacement part for the crib. 
I started out pumping and thought I would store all of my milk in Medela's bottles. When I realized how much milk I would need to store, I quickly realized that would cost me an arm and a leg (the bottles run about 20 bucks for 4!) and came upon these little wonders. They are made of a thick polyethylene plastic (safe for long-term storage) and you can't beat the zip-loc style closure compared with other tie bags...those scared me, every drop truly is precious. Granted, they are a bit awkward at first because you are dealing with a container that is much less sturdy than the plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used to it. 
Intstead of adding yet another musical instrument to the toy box, I purchased this for her at just over 2 yrs of age. It is our only Xylophone, and she loved it immediately. I still hear the tingling of chimes downstairs, when she is upstairs at bathtime with her dad. She makes her own melodies. She hits any note and sings her favorite songs to it. It has held up well 
After several attempts to get my 6 year old interested in some form of musical instrument I found this toy. We both love it. It combines two of her favorite things, making noise and playing with water. It floats on the water or sticks to the walls. She is even learning to recognize the positions and names of the notes on the water proof song sheets included and can now play the songs on her little piano and her recorder. Songs like Twinkle Twinkle and Mary had a Little Lamb, etc. I wish they would make additional song sheets for her to learn 
this item is about as festive as you can get! (besides the water flutes) i was afraid they wouldn't resonate. they float, they piece together like a puzzle and they sound terrific! 
My 4 month old loves it, and has loved it since he was around 3 months old. I hang it from his bassinet, the toy bar on his stroller/car seat, and the toybar on his swing. It always catches his interest and as he's growing he's discovering new things about it. That the feet make sounds or feel crunchy, etc. It's great to watch him engage a toy like this. It's the first one that he had interest in, and the longest-lasting 
My newborn hated tummy time on the floor. Would lay his head down and just cry, just like my daughter had. I bought the lamaze spin and explore, and he loved it. Within days, he could hold his head all the way up for minutes at a time, and now that he is four months old, he spins himself around playing with the different toys attached. Great buy 
My daughter received a small Fluffles from grandma when she was 4-5 months old... She had a visible reaction to it right from the start, and has not spent a single night without him for the past 5 years. We have bought several backup Fluffles, thank goodness, some have been lost but we were able to replace. I regularly wash them in the normal spin cycle with normal detergent, and I dry them in the gentle cycle of the dryer. They are not as fluffy and texture of fur has changed a bit but they have held up fine 
We bought this for our daughter when she was approximately 5 months old. She is now 3 and has been sleeping with it every night since then. Whenever she is upset about something she gets her lamby and cuddles with it until she feels better. We always take it on trips with us and she hugs it in the car. It has sewn on eyes so we don't worry about choking hazards. WARNING: When she was very young my daughter got her fingers caught under and twisted in the ribbon around the lamb's neck. We have two back up Fluffles and have cut the ribbons off all of them. 
My son has had the smaller version (11") Fluffles (aka Lambchop) since birth. He is now 9 months old and has to have "Lambchop" go everywhere he goes. Needless to say Lambchop gets very used. The label says surface clean only, but my Mother keeps our son and she decided one day to try to wash Lambchop. He really needed a good washing because our son was going through the heavy drooling stage and Lambchop's fur was getting crunchy. Well, he made it through the gentle cycle and through the dryer (on a rack with the air fluff cycle). He has been washed this way several times. He comes out so nice and fluffy. Of course, wash at your own risk, but it works for us. I am going to purchase our son the larger version (14") Fluffles. This will be so handy in the event we have to retire the original Fluffles (Lambchop), and Fluffles will be able to grow with our son, also. We love this toy 
My twins are 3 months old and have been sleeping through the night for a month because of these blankets. They are super soft and keep my babies nice warm during cold nights (especially their hands). I worried about them pulling their blankets over their faces at night and swaddling with receiving blankets wouldn't hold them (they wiggle a lot) so these are the perfect solution. I'm ordering 2 more in the large size to get us through the winter. I highly recommend and will be gifting these to my expectant friends in the future. 
When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
Our son, now 3 mo's old, is a great sleeper when he's swaddled in this thing. Without it he thrashes his arms and legs and startles himself awake. With it he settles down and sleeps like a champ. We've been using it since he was a newborn. The little square of velcro doesn't hold the bottom part on well at all, but it's winter so we dress him in sleeper jammies underneath the Swaddleme anyway so it's not a big issue. When we came home from the hospital at first we tried swaddling using receiving blankets but our son wiggled right out. We're huge fans of the SwaddleMe and now give it as our standard baby shower gift. 
This is a great idea, which I really thought my baby would enjoy since I had read they loved to be swaddled. But my daughter did not like to be swaddled at all. So I ended up returning this product and using our Halo sleepsacks instead, which gave her hands and feet more freedom. My advice is to purchase only one of these before birth and then if your baby enjoys being swaddled then purchase more, if not you can return it or not and not feel bad that it was only $9.99. Also remember once babies can move their hands around more freely they should not be swaddled. 
We have three of these, one for each vehicle, and they have served our daughter well. They are lightweight for easy portability, and soft, as booster seats go 
This was a really nice changing pad. It was soft and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is that you will have to buy a cover for it, so that's more add'l money. It was worth the price though. 
I got this monitor new on ebay -- it has a great range -- I love the clarity that it offers...I can tell if the baby is waking up...just rolling over...giggling in his sleep... :) I recommend it over the other, higher priced monitors. 
This product works very well. It has a long range, the battery last long and the reception is very good. Also the feature of having two AC adaptors helps to save the battery life of the receiver 
I ordered this monitor to listen for my mother who is unable to get around because I am unable to sit with her every moment. I wanted to be able to have some freedom to roam around another room and be able to listen for her in case she needed me. The monitor wasn't that expensive, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised that this monitor picks up every noise in the room. There is also a clip so you can attatch it to yourself and not be contained to one room of the house. It can either be plugged in or ran by batteries. I couldn't be more pleased with the monitor. I would recommend it because it is worth every cent 
Don't be fooled! This carseat cover is no where near weather proof. That's not to say it isn't a nice product. I do like it much better than any other cover I've found. It does keep my 3-month-old nice and warm, however, the flap that goes over her head is not secured by anything. The wind easily catches it and blows it off 
I tried it out myself and it was so comfy womfy I couldnt even believe it you silly tootzii wootziis!!!!!! 
This is a must for any parent that lives in a cold climate, we use this item on a daily basis and I could not imagine having to struggle with my newborn trying to get her into a snowsuit. I have had many comments on how cute the bundle me is and have found that is washes up very nicely, and provides the utmost in convienence 
I received this gift after my daughter was born and we used it for the first time today and I LOVE IT! It was so soft and warm that I wish they made them for adults! The colors are beautiful and the entire thing is washable. The only downfall is that there is no way to cover her head without her suffocating. Luckily there is extra fabric on the top piece that I tucked underneath my hand while I was carring the carseat and it did block the horrible Michigan wind. If there were 10 stars then the Urban Bundle Me would receive all 10 
I love this carrier cover. It is so soft and it keeps my baby warm. It also protects her from the rain when we step out from the car to the places we are going to. Everyone is always asking me where I baught this cover. There is nothing like it! I totally recomend this product 
I love this bundle me product and so does my baby girl. I also got many compliments from other parents on how it looked and the fabric 
These are awesome training pants! They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I've found. They look like real underwear. Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents. They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training 
My daughter is only 2 and a half, but she is off the charts for height and weight. As such, she simply didn't fit into her regular car seat anymore. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about switching her from a car seat to a booster seat before the age of 3, but she was VERY uncomfortable in her car seat and would cry whenever we stuffed her into it. So, I bit the proverbial bullet and bought this booster. One feature that really interested me in this seat was portability. My father lives out of state so we will be doing a lot of traveling. I wanted a seat we could easily check on an airplane. This seat fit the bill. The seat is not as compact as I would have hoped, but it is no bigger than a small piece of luggage and could be easily carried onto a plane. However, I think this seat will be a little cumbersome to "carry on" if you are trying to manage getting onto a plane with a 2 and a half year old and everything else that comes with her (coloring books, portable dvd player, snacks etc); so I will more than likely check this seat. As such I am going to order the carrying case (I saw in some reviews that some folks checked the seat in the box it came in, but I find that to be too cumbersome). As for the seat itself, my daughter LOVES it. She is very comfortable in it and calls it her "big girl seat" -- no more fights getting her into her seat!!! I LOVE that it has a compartment to store the owner's manual in so that you always have it at hand. Also, even though it is not a five point harness, I feel my daughter is very secure in it. I love that it has the wrap around headrest, and the height couldn't be easier to adjust -- we figured it out before we even opened the manual. When you thread the shoulder belt through the "catch" under the headrest, it positions the belt correctly over your child's body so that he/she is not choked by it. (Make sure you pull the belt all the way out and then let it slowly wind itself back until it is taut over your child -- this will lock the belt in place). I would have given this seat five stars if it folded down a little more compactly and/or came with the carrying case (it has a built in handle, but if you are going to check this on a plane, I would feel more comfortable having it in something to protect the fabric from ripping, staining etc). Overall this is a GREAT product which is comparably priced to other full booster seats which don't fold. I have recommended this to my friends 
That's just it- I love this product, and I am so happy that we purchased it. It saves time and space, and is very safe for my children. We bought 2, one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful 
I really love this diaper bag. It is compact and light weight. I have other diaper bags but this is the only one I use. Its many pockets allows you to carry everthing you need for the you and your bunble of joy. I'm serious it all fits. I'm really happy with this dipaper ba 
I have a 2.5 year old and a 16 month old and this bag leaves my hands free to carry them or hold hands without having to constantly adjust a bag. It is the perfect size to take just what we need and not be bogged down by an inconvient bag. The very bottom pocket is very easy to get into without taking the bag off, it's a great place for your wallet and keys. If you need to carry sippy cups and not bottles make sure they are not too tall or they won't fit in the middle compartment (which is meant for bottles) The bottle attachment is good to store snacks if you don't need to carry a bottle 
This has been the perfect diaper bag - so easy to wear and compartments for everything. It looks compact, but is pretty roomy. I have a 3 year old and 18 month old and carry my cell phone, wallet, plenty of snacks, sippy cup, 2 diaper and wipes everywhere we go. I haven't missed all the excess stuff I used to carry in my uncomfortable previous diaper bags. Love it 
Years ago with my first child, I learned to hate those cliché, oversized diaper bags, especially when most of my outings were short errands. Why bring what amounts to a piece of luggage on those short trips? This diaper bag is the ULTIMATE in functionality for brief jaunts, holding a truly amazing amount of stuff, but holding it stylishly, to boot. It may look small, but I can carry three or four diapers, a small container of wipes, a change of clothes, a nursing shawl, a burp cloth or two, spare baby socks and a hat, a teething ring or two, a snack, my wallet, keys, Palm pilot, a tube of diaper rash cream, and a few other odds and ends in there with no problem. There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized. I get a lot of compliments on it, which is strange considering it's a diaper bag. In fact, a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I'd gotten it, because it was "exactly the purse she'd been looking for"-- she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag! It's sporty enough that my husband and 13-y.o. son don't mind carrying it, either. If you're going on a day trip, you'll need something bigger, but for those typical "quickie" errands, you can't beat this bag 
My daughter loves this toy. She got it for Christmas. I didn't have batteries for it for a few days, but she played with it even without the sounds lights. She loves the phone that hangs from it. I finally got batteries for it, and it kept her entertained quite a bit on our 11 hour trip to the beach. The remote came in handy. I'd just hit a button, it would light up play music for her while she was in her car seat. Highly recommend! 
I love it! Great way to keep my daughter from touching/chewing the cart and me from having to touch the cart handle. There are loops to attach toys and 2 side pockets to hold small items. I find the material thickness to be perfectly fine, I mean come on this isnt a carseat it's fabric meant to be a barrier between baby cart. If it were padded or had an organizer in the back it would be too bulky take up cart space. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the safety belt is too long it isnt attached to the product which means it will most likely get lost (Mine did) Overall great product makes an excellent babyshower gift. 
I had originally tried another type of shopping cart cover which was difficult to use. A friend of mine was using the Buggy Bagg and I was impressed that she was able to install it in the cart with one hand while holding her baby in the other. I liked that the Buggy Bagg *completely* covered anywhere the baby might touch. It comes with a pillow but frankly the padded back and seat were so comfortable that I never needed to use the it. (You may find the pillow more useful with a younger baby that isn't sitting up steadily yet.) I've also used it to cover a restaurant high chair - the fit is very tight and a bit lopsided, but if you have a small baby it works out great! The large pockets on the back are also a great feature. I keep wipes, diapers and diaper cream in the large pocket all the time, and the smaller pockets come in handy while I'm shopping for my sunglasses and coupons. 
My mom insisted that I have one of these. So I shopped and shopped around and found this. It is truly the ultimate cart cover! It's very plush and the Jungle fabric had both my husband and I entertained for a 1/2 hour!! Tons of teriffic features. I highly recommend this one 
With three children in our household, we've seen our share of good and back educational toys. This one is one of the best, particularly for households that want to promote musical affinity. It provides endless combinations of choices depending on where the child places the cube. It also gives three different "styles" of music: jazzy, classical and funk. The only reservation I have is that it may be a little to difficult for babies less than 1 year old. 
My daughter received this on her first birthday and still plays with it two years later! We've been able to use it for naming colors, matching shapes, and putting together different musical compositions. The cartridge with African beats/Irish jig is a lot of fun. We haven't had any trouble with dropping this toy and it not playing (and it's been dropped/thrown/kicked....loved?). My only complaint is the price! (the reason for 4 stars) 
We have both an Urban and the Lite Bundle Me. I'm glad we bought both! The thicker Urban has been great in the colder weather. It's thicker, and so stiffer, than the Lite, which makes it easier for me to zip up in the carseat and then fold the 'flap' down to leave my daughter's face exposed. In windy, cold or nasty weather I bring the flap up to cover her completely for the short outdoor time between car and destination. The Lite is flimsier, and was perfect for early Fall and I'm starting to use it in the stroller for warmer winter days. I personally prefer the stiffer Urban, but the Urban is so much warmer than the Lite I'm glad to have both. Switching the 2 is very easy and takes only a minute or two. With both versions, we just put on a hat and the baby is ready to go! No jackets or snowsuits needed. We also have a set of Cushy Straps (cute fleece animal-shaped covers for the stroller/carseat straps that cushion the straps AND help keep the child's head from lolling around) and those help keep the top of baby from being too exposed when you have the Bundle Me folded down or partially unzipped 
I love this product. I got it after taking a shopping trip during cold weather and struggling all day long to keep my baby warm with a blanket. Since I got this, shopping in cold weather is a breeze. The only thing is, as soon as you get inside anywhere, you'll need to unzip the top and take it off, or your baby will get way too hot. I also use it on my stroller during walks, and even in 40 degree weather, my son is able to take a cozy nap while I get my exercise. It's really easy to take on and off your carseat. They make one for toddlers, also, so I may get another when my son outgrows this one 
Overall we are quite happy with the BundleMe, which fits perfectly into our infant car seat (Graco SnugRide). The product is of good quality, though the zippers are not running very smoothly. Regarding its design, the only downside we see is that the front part is very loose, making it difficult to get a tight enough fit around baby's neck and shoulders to keep him warm in colder weather. Bottom line, however, is that it is a good product that we can recommend. 
The Bundle Me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months. It attaches very easily to the carseat, and I can leave all the extra blankets at home (except for a light one). This particular model is wind and rain resistant, which is nice for keeping my little one dry. It's a great concept; kudos to whomever invented it! I do have 2 complaints though. First, it's not as effective for younger babies. My daughter is just 7 weeks old, and I don't zip up all the way. This keeps the fabric out of her face. I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her. Secondly, the zippers aren't as smooth as I'd like them to be. They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside, so zipping up is sometimes more work, and always when I'm in a hurry! But overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's nice having a barrier against the wind, rain and cold with just one item 
If you travel with a toddler this is a great item to have. We had one of the "cheaper" ones before and you get what you pay for. The cheaper one didn't last through the first leg of our trip! This one is very heavy duty and well made. 
We have the Britax Marathon (Greatest seat ever) and this is our second carrier... the seat fits into the bag very easily. It hooks up to our suitcase and is ready to be pulled. We strongly recommend this seat 
This was a great purchase. The bag fit my Britax Boulevard carseat with the GoGoBabyz wheels attached to it. I was able to wheel my baby in the car seat at the airport and up to the gate and then easily place the carseat with wheels into the bag and gate check it. It kept the car seat clean and I was able to store an extra blanket inside the bag. 
I couldn't imagine traveling with a wandering toddler alone with all the carry-ons AND the car seat. This car seat carrier sure is a life saver. It's easy to use, easy to roll and easy to fold store. It makes a big difference having those wheels. My only concern with this product was the fabric, it was thinner than I expected. If it were to have a sturdier fabric, it would be perfect 
This is the second car seat carrier we've owned but the first one with wheels. The wheels make SUCH a difference when you're traveling with kids! Both of our car seats fit (we took the lighter of the two) with a little extra room for coats, toys, etc. The bag held up well for our first trip and it was easy to use. I only wish it had 4 wheels instead of 2, but you can't beat this one for the price 
We used this carrier while on a trip to Florida. It was very convenient to use and wheel through the airport since we dont check the carseat so we can use it on the plane. Since the bag as 2 zippers on it, we were actually able to leave my sleeping daughter in the car seat in the bag with the zippers part way down in each side so her face was out. This way I didnt have to carry a sleeping baby and by other bags through the aiirport- I just pulled her along in the car seat since it has wheels. She fell asleep in her carseat while on the plane and didnt wake up until after we got off the plane, picked up our baggage, got our rental car, and put her car seat in the car and were traveling to our destination. We also have used the Eddie Bauer bag on a past trip - the strap broke while carrying it through the airport and it doesnt have wheels so it was much more difficult to carry. 
This is exactly what I was looking for my little thumb sucker. Keeps his hands clean. Fits all shopping carts so far, inc. Costco. I use it on restaurant high chairs as well. Worth every penny you spend on it 
It is worthy for me to purchase this item for my daughter to stay so clean while going shopping. : 
i received this as a baby welcoming gift back in oct 2003. i have used it every single time we need a shopping cart and LOVE it! i leave it in the back of my car and grab it when we go to a store. almost everytime we're out, i get someone asking me where i got it. i wash mine probably once or twice a month and it still looks fabulous! my second child is using it and loves to eat a small snack off of it while we shop. i am buying one for my friend who is due next month and will buy for all my future expecting friends! perfect gift and dearly loved 
The Whimsical Clean Shopper has met all my expectations: it is easy to use, fits both shopping carts of all sizes as well as restaurant highchairs, it is large enough to cover all those germ-infested areas that my baby might touch or chew on, quickly folds when we're done with it and easy to wash. I couldn't ask for more 
We've been using this cart cover for four months now and have really liked it. I originally ordered it to provide a little extra cushioning in the cart seat but have liked that I can attach a toy to it and stuff a bottle in the pocket. When my son goes through a teething phase it's handy as a barrier over the various carts. It's much easier to throw the cover over the cart than wipe down the entire seat. I like the whimsical pattern--it's so bright and cheery. We're expecting a baby girl in a couple of months and are happy to be able to use this pattern with her also. We've also used it as a highchair cover in restaurants from time to time. It's a little bulky but functions as a great crumb catcher 
My son is 7 months old and just started sitting in high chairs at restaurants and shopping carts. So far, the Clean Shopper is working pretty well for us. The fabric is thick, so it doesn't make a tiny package. It also doesn't fold up neatly, so you have to kind of just wad it up. It isn't cushioned, but if it were it would be huge, and I have enough issue trying to carry my son, a cart cover, my purse, and whatever else I might need. Besides, he doesn't really need cushioning. Even at 7 months, he's perfectly comfy on the thick bedspread-like fabric. The Clean Shopper comes in a thick plastic bag (the sort of thing bedspreads or other linens come in) that zips closed. It's a snug fit to get in there because of the wadded nature of the bundle, but it works fine. The handle is short and taut, so isn't of much use. A longer strap so it could be shoulder worn or hung on a stroller would be better. The loops work well, and it's a relief to have a clean place my son can sit and play with anchored toys. He can't throw the toys in the floor, and he stays entertained. There are velcro tabs on the front that can be fastened around the front of a shopping cart or high chair. This keeps it in place better. The leg holes don't match up exactly with whatever he's sitting in, but it doesn't cause a problem. My main problem with the Clean Shopper is that the belt strap does not attach to the seat. It's a completely seperate piece. Unless you are careful to snap the belt clips together, looping the belt around a part of the seat, you will end up losing the strap. Somehow I've lost mine after only a few uses. I kept it rolled up inside the thing when I removed it from a cart, and it probably fell out in a parking lot somewhere. When handling a baby, your purse, whatever is in your cart (or trying to eat at a restaurant), it is very easy to overlook such a small item. Since the website sells replacement straps, it seems they are aware of the issue. It's a shame they don't have velcro tabs that stick it to the back of the shopper, making it harder to lose the strap. I've ordered two replacements in black, so I can see the strap more clearly against my blue Clean Shopper. I will also make certain I buckle the strap clips. It's a good seat cover overall, definitely worth having. Just be careful of the strap 
I love my clean shopper and every time I use it, I have at least one person asking me where I got it. I also buy it as baby gifts for all of my friends. It's the best purchase that I've bought. There are no strings to tie, no velcro to deal with, no snaps or buttons...it's just a piece of fabric that covers pretty much all size carts. To keep my now toddler occupied while I shop (I still use it for him) I place some goldfish either next to him, or in front of him and he eats them while I shop. Those who say there is no cushioning, that's not really the purpose of the clean shopper! It's purpose is to act as a buffer between you and the cart. If there was cushion to it and tons of bells and whistles, then it would be too bulky and too cumbersome to deal with. I can easily flip it on the cart with one hand while I've got my kid in my other. I highly recommend the clean shopper to any parent 
This is a great shopping cart cover! The cost is a little more than other covers but is definately worth the extra money. It covers every part of the cart your baby can touch. I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs (not a perfect fit - but covers everything). There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever (I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes). It is a bit large when folded (to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it), but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric. It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle (I'm guessing it's about 12"x8" and about 2"thick - I leave mine in the car). I just wish I would have found this sooner - my daughter loves it too. Would be a great gift for a baby shower 
This potty helped our son to go from sitting on the toilet to standing "Like Daddy". He loves it, and our youngest son is now trying to follow his big brother. Quality construction, and a breeze to clean and store 
My son was learning to potty on the toilet but I was in no rush due to all the extra time I had to spend cleaning the potty "splash zone" around our toilet. I was happy to purchase the Peter Potty and give it a shot and happier that Amazon had free shipping on it at the time. It arrived quickly and was easy to set up. My son loves it!!! He is proud at his new talent and I am happy to spend less time wearing cleaning gloves. I add a tiny amount of bleach to the water in the top compartment so when he flushes there is a little less cleaning for me. Thanks Amazon 
I keep my 2 yr old grandson and bought this in hopes it would stop the mess at potty time.It went everywhere except where it was supposed to go, if you know what I mean.It works great, NO MORE MESS!The only thing I disliked was it was so easy to remove the water container and that is just what he liked to do.Since he has gotten used to it he no longer messes with the container.He uses it, flushes it and on his way.My other grandson was here this weekend and he chose to use it for the first time and did great also. It is a great product and I would highly recommend it.I might be buying 2 more 
this was one of the best devices we ever got to help with toilet training. The boys really took to it right away and now prefer it over the sit down. The flushing mechanism is not well made and broke pretty quickly. But we still use it a lot 
We bought this potty for our son, while he was potty training. At first he didn't want to stand up, but once I got The Peter Potty, it's all he uses. It's very easy to use and it's his own potty! We did have some trouble with it not flushing, but figured out that I was screwing the lid on to tight. I would recommend this potty for any little boy. Remember to dump the tray every night too 
This sheet is soft and nicely padded. It fits the play yard well. I would recommend it to other parents 
I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - we used this for my daughter all fall, winter and spring, and her seatbelt laid just fine - there was no difference at all. It velcros around the seatbelts, so I'm not sure what the nurses were talking about. Other than that, this thing is wonderful! My daughter was a summer baby, so we usually just used receiving blankets. But we got this in the fall and were able to use it all winter and into the spring. It kept her warm enough, even on the cold days. I would probably suggest getting the heavier version for newborns in the winter, but this worked great for our older baby in the winter. There's no need to worry about blankets or extra layers of clothes or snowsuits. The Bundle Me Lite stays attached to the carseat, all you need to do is zip it up, and you're ready to go! It detaches very easily (because it's just velcro) and can be washed. It actually acted as a protective barrier for the carseat for those "accidents." We still washed the carseat for these situations, but it greatly minimized damage! This is a fabulous "extra" for the carseat, we'll definitely be using it again with the next baby 
I just purchased this for the cool, wet spring months of New England. I also have the Bundle Me Original which was great for the winter months. This is a nice alternative when the Original becomes too warm to use , but you still need a little something. The inner lining is soft against your baby's skin and the outside lining protects him/her against cool weather and rain. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it does not fit as well on my car seat as the Original. It tends to slide down a little. I have the new Graco Safe Seat which is larger than most car seats so this could be the reason. It may fit better on smaller car seats. I also love the pink "girly" color. Now that the weather is warming up a bit, it works great when going into air conditioned buildings that are just a little too cool for baby. It is also a nice barrier from the sun's harmful rays 
I bought one of these and a regular bundle me for my daughter. I have an older child that goes to school and it protected my daughter from the wind/rain when we had to go to the bus stop in bad weather. I only gave 4 stars because I used the regular bundle me much more than the lite. Given the choice to do it over I would still have bought it though 
I bought one of these for my daughter. I had it in the car seat when we left the hospital. The nurses made me take it out. They wouldn't let her leave the hospital with it. They said it wasn't safe to use. They said the it doesn't allow the seatbelt straps to lay properly over the baby's shoulders making it unsafe. I wish I would have known this before I bought it. 
This lamp is perfect in my baby's nursery. It matches all the other Hello Kitty stuff 
This lamp is so cute and just what I had hoped. The kitty is stuffed, and the only down side to it is that her neck slightly slouches (I'd prefer her sitting more upright) though I am sure there is a way to straighten her out a bit. Lamp is well made and gives off good light without being too bright. Perfect for your Hello Kitty fan 
easy to use, fast, with a flexible tip. I believe the readings where accurate and the beeping was a nice signal of fever before you even looked at the thing. And the flexible tip also comes in handy when you're doing underarm temp taking.... I hate doing a rectal one, but this makes me feel like I'm not being totally invasive. : 
I love this humidifier because it lasts long. My brother is already through his 3rd humidifier in 4 years while I've only had this unit for 4 years it has more years ahead. Also, I find the volume at the low setting very soothing and helps me fall asleep. I've read the posts that mention the filters being hard to find. However, they are very easy to find. The evenflo filter is the SAME EXACT filter as the Holmes HWF62 filter which is available in many places since Holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter. I just purchased a "colorcheck" by Holmes filter from Walmart and I still have an original evenflo branded filter from last year. I put them up to each other and they are the SAME EXACT dimensions. Actually, I prefer the colorcheck over the original evenflo filter because I think it lasts longer before needing replacement. If you look at the bottom of the evenflo humidifier box, it will say that this humidifier was manufactored by Holmes for evenflo. Therefore, it would only make sense that a Holmes filter would be compatible with this unit 
I have been through 5 humidifiers in the last 2 months. This is the only one that I have found that sufficiently does the job! There is no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer for a length of time because there is no vapor. After buying others like this, that draws dry air in and releases cool and moist air, I was skeptical to spend the money on this one because I found the others not to work well at all! When running this humidifier for the first time, I could actually notice a difference in the humidity level in my daughter's room after running it for about an hour. This did not happen with the others. Yes, it is a loud unit but you get used to it and it does a great job of draining out all of the other noise in the home for my toddler while she is sleeping. I have never had a problem with the filter or finding replacements, nor have I had a problem with my toddler taking it apart. I am very please with this product and will continue to recommend it to others. 
After reading the other reviews on this product I felt that I needed to put a positive spin on this product. I registered for this item and received it at my shower. My son is 5 1/2 months old and was severly congested. I took the box out of his closet and set up the machine. After the first night (about 10 hours) he woke up for the first time in 2 weeks able to drink his bottle with out me using saline drops and an aspirator. I am continuing to use this product every night and every morning is much more pleasant. As for the noise level I do not find that to be an issue. I don't have a problem hearing my son cry or even move around on the monitor. I feel the noise is actually soothing for the child and helps fade out other noise in the house. I am glad I got this product and would personally recommended it to anyone. I do understand this product is a little pricey but I believe it is worth every penny!!!!! 
My granddaughter loves this book! She has other similar types of books. They are great for chewing on without getting ruined! No one gets hurt if she throws it! Bright and cheerful colors. Also, very durable 
My 8 month old loves this book. It is fun to read, and she enjoys the interaction with the caterpillar 
Finally a bottle that is easy to clean and my baby loves! We have been through every bottle out there and wasted so much money that I vowed never to try another--but when my second baby refused the bottle (I had settled on the playtex with my son because it was problem-free) and refused playtex, I tried these. It's the only bottle she will take. She is also breastfed, so I'm not sure if these are just better for breastfed babies, but she has no gas problems with these, and they are incredibly easy. Also cool how the cover fits on the bottom of the bottle so if you are out and about it's easy to find. 
My daughter is breastfed, and we started her on 1 bottle a day of breastmilk when she was 3.5 weeks old. She started using the Playtex Ventair, and had no problems for over a month. Then, all of a sudden, she went on a bottle strike. We tried different bottles (Dr. Browns, Avent, cheapies) and different nipple flows - she wouldn't take any of them. When I found out that Soothie made bottles, I thought it was definately worth the try, since that was the only pacifier that she would take. She took the Soothie bottle instantly 
Love it! Love it! My 5 month old has been breastfed with an occasional bottle. I decided to move her to bottle only, and she refused any kind of bottle. I tried Avent, Playtex Nurser, Evenflo Elan, and Gerber. I even tried different flows and materials of some of these bottles. I tried them over and over again, but when I tried the Soothie, she took it the very first time and hasn't even complained. What a relief!!!! Besides being relieved that she will take the Soothie, they are also very inexpensive, which is another plus 
Our son would never take a paci if it weren't for soothies!!! and there is no giving it up now! --now that we have the same nipple for our bottle. no more nipple confusion! :oP They are great, no complaints. I don't know why the previous reviewer only gave 4 stars. If you don't screw ANY bottle tight enough it leaks ...duh!  
The hamper is very sturdy.It is also large enough to hold quite a lot of clothes. I would highly recommend it. 
Not only does this hamper match the Dream Teddy line, it also nice quality. It comes pre-assembled, just unfold! The mesh bag that hangs inside makes emptying the hamper easy. Definitely worth the money! Also it is worth ordering from Amazon; I tried ordering this from a different site that had it offered for less and never received it! 
The minute we opened the box i knew i made the right desicion to purchase this stroller. The weight is unbelieveable, the ride is smooth - ONE FINGER push is what it takes! My 7 mos. old baby girl looked very comfortable in it, recline is pretty good for an infant (a 2 hr nap is the proof). My previous purchase of Britax Blue Blaze (sold it on craigs list the day after we received it) was a big mistake. Spend a little more the get whole a lot. A good stroller is a good investment 
We bought this stroller from BRU in Dec. for a trip to Disney. Our Graco was too bulky and hard to fold to mess with getting on and off buses and rides. I chose this stroller after trying out ALL the strollers at the store and made sure it was easy to use and very lightweight. I love that the 5-point harness comes off the back so my son can sit forward in the seat. The back lays all the way down, unlike my Graco. The basket is a good size, but difficult to get things in and out of if the baby is laying down. We have no trouble keeping the cup holder in the tray. One warning: make sure you take the buttons off the handles after you fold the stroller if you put it on an airplane. They pop off easily and luckily an airline worker found ours in the luggage compartment. This is the only stroller I use now and my Graco is collecting dust 
The stroller arrived and said nowhere on the box it was the MT so when I called to make sure we has received the stroller we ordered the service rep was QUITE nasty and kept telling me to just send it back. I LOVED the stroller and wanted to of course keep it just wanted to confirm it was the right one. Apparently that was too much to ask. I finally got a supervisor who with the click of a button could tell me there was a note for all service reps regarding this model stating it is in fact the MT it just doesn't say it on the box. That was fine and dandy but the service rep was incredibly snotty and didn't want to take anytime to bother making sure it was the correct product would have rather just had me send it back. Bad for business I'd guess. Not to mention they do have a serious issue letting people know when items are out of stock. It was IN stock when we ordered and magically out of stock the day it was to be shipped, then when I went to cancel the order via phone (48 min on hold!!) they said oh it had already shipped they couldn't cancel the order. How odd... since I had no shipping info!!! Turns out the stroller didn't ship for another WEEK and they could have easily canceled my order. I don't plan to buy the Amazon again anytime soon. The stroller however is FANTASTIC!! It folds up small, easy to use with one hand and very nice on the eyes!! Stroller gets 5 stars Amazon gets 
This is the 4th stroller I've purchased. I had a lightweight COMBI that was GREAT for travel as it folds to be tiny and was only $40. But it was not going to hack it for the everyday use. The larger travel system stoller I had is so cumbersome in stores and difficult to load into the trunk. This ARIA is very easy, looks great, lightweight and found the balance between small and sturdy. I love it. I recommend it to other moms when I get the chance. Peg has a great reputation for lasting, so I hope that this "entry level" price point meets that expectation. So far I feel like it's a great value as far as strollers go 
I have been using a Maclaren Triumph for the past 18 months, and have been envious of all the features my friends strollers had. What my stroller was missing? - a leg rest, window through the canopy, a greater sun shade, the ability to increase the recline thoroughly, are all found with the zooper twist, plus more. I love the matching boot, and that the accessories are included. I may go ahead and order a more structured cup holder cuz I dont trust the mesh one for coffee. Also, the wheels are smaller than what you might find on a more expensive stroller, so for longer walks you may want a nicer zooper model. Other than that, it is gorgeous, and perfect for mall walking/ shorter street walks. My friends now have stroller envy of me for a change, and thats fun. ;- 
These are great - our 8 month old can't rip them off the table like she does everything else that's NOT taped down! one note, though, is that you can't use them on restaurant booster seat trays - you need to have a totally flat surface. Overall though, the placemats are great, with cute designs, and the bonus Purell doesn't hurt either 
We purchased this Fisher Price soft travel tray prior to our 12 Hour plane flight to Hawaii. We have a 2 1/2 year old and she used this for everything on the plane, as well as in the car while we were in Hawaii. The tray is great for snacks, coloring, playing, and pretty much anything else you can think of. It is especially beneficial on a plane as the trays on the plane don't work well with for kids in carseats. I won't go anywhere without this product! It is comfortable as the bottom is squishy so it won't hurt their legs and it straps on so they don't lose any thing. We plan on buying another one when our baby is old enough to use it. 
Having twins we always had to write down everything, or we wouldn't remember whom we feed, when we feed them, or any details. We used to keep a chart, but then I received the Itzbeen as a gift. It is so much faster to press a button then to write everything down. When we go out I just toss it in my purse and when the babies start crying I can just pull out the itzbeen look at the timers and figure out if it is time to eat or they are just being fussy. If the boys do eat or require a diaper change, I can record it easily. no more carrying around a clipboard! I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be even better if it could track how many oz of formula the babies eat and if it could total the number of hours the baby slept. But still it is a nice tool for forgetful people. I'm buying a 2nd one, so I have one for each of my twins 
We have a GE XL44 gas stove. Installation was all of ten seconds. We have a "crawler" not yet "toddler". So far, he can just reach the knobs and can't get enough leverage from that angle to do anything. For us it's pretty easy to open and close the covers to use the burners 
A little annoying at first, but once you get used to them, they are great 
I've been using them for 5 years now--the SAME ONES and they're fabulous! They're not hard at all to use (nothing like the doorknob covers--those things are annoying!) and they DO keep my children from touching the knobs, which is what they're for. I've never had a problem with the babies pulling them off or figuring out how to open the stove AND if they go towards the stove at all it gives me that extra split second to deter them that I might not have without them. 
I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant, and so far I've been very pleased. I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I'm out running errands. There are just a few parts, so assembly, disassembly, and cleaning is very easy. But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds, but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby. 
If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day (maybe 2 or 3) this is a great pump. I didn't know how to use it at first but after calling Medela's customer support line I was able to use it easily. I didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout the day (Your hands would hurt). But other than that I think is a great pump for the price 
With 2 little kids in a stroller, I depend heavily on these hooks to help me carry all the gear I have, especially when traveling or shopping. The diaper bag and coats fit into the strollers basket, but I've used the hooks to carry an additional beach bag to the beach or pool, as well as shopping bags. I've also used them to hold my purse and camera bag. They really increase the holding capacity of the stroller. I wish they were more widely available! Unfortunately, they can be hard to find in stores and on the web 
My son is 7 weeks old and has been using the Snuggle Nest in my bed since he was 3 weeks old. He loves his Snuggle Nest and began sleeping 3-4 hours at a time the very 1st night in it. We now use it in combination with the Swaddle Me wrap and the techniques I learned in the free Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that came with our Snuggle Nest. Thanks to this wonderful combo our 7 week old baby sleeps through the night (7-8 hrs). This is my 3rd baby and the 1st I used a Snuugle Nest or swaddling with and he is the 1st to sleep so well so early. If I could give this product 10 stars I would. I also plan to use the Snuggle Nest when/if we transition our baby to his crib in a month or two, I am sure it will make the transition easier on him 
I really recommend this product...our baby did not like the bassinet for some reason, and as a newborn, we didn't want him too far from us. This was the perfect solution, although I would agree with some of the other users that it takes up quite a bit of room in the bed. But I honestly didn't mind being a little squished given that my son slept so well in it and he was right next to us. And, it's great for travel 
We bought this the day after our son came home and we had one night of constant worry. We had planed on using a bassinet by the bed but I had an emergency c-section and it was too difficult to get out of bed to get to him. He is now 2 months and we still love it. We don't have to worry about him at all during the night and he is very accessible for breastfeeding. We have a king size bed and it fits fine. It also makes it much easier to reach over and put a hand on him to quiet him during the night 
I recomend this item to parents who want to have peace of mind while their baby is asleep. It protects the child from rolling onto his/her side and allows the parents to sleep with their baby without the fear of smuthering the baby. However it is best if you have a King size bed. My Huband and I sleep on either edge of the bed while the baby is asleep in between us, feeling a little cramped 
I bought the snuggle nest when my son was almost 10 weeks old. We realized that he slept better in smaller more confining places where he could touch the sides at all times. He had been sleeping through the night in his baby carriage but was getting too long for it. This was perfect. I put it in his crib (at the bottom so he couldn't wiggle out) and he continued to sleep through the night 
Everyone who sees these bath turtles comments how very cute they are. My son (13 months) loves playing with them. However, they get turned over pretty easily and float upside-down, and the bottom sides are not the fun spinning/twirling/rattle/mirror sides 
My son has a great time with his bath turtles. He's learned the colors and play features on each turtle, so that's an educational plus that I did not expect at all! Somehow, the turtles end up floating upside down during bath time--splash factor, maybe? But that's half the fun--making him turn them over again for more play. They are easy to clean and dry so that's a plus. The one bath turtle I don't completely understand is the one with the mirror inside. Because of the temperature of the water, it causes condensation in the protective plastic bubble, so he can't see the mirror anyway, so what's the point in that one? Nevertheless, he kinda looks at it in the middle of his bath and probably thinks, "Hey, I was there a minute ago..." He picks that one up, holds it up to his eye level, struggles to find himself for a second, laughs, and puts it back in the water and picks up another turtle. Go figure. It's still good fun for him, and the turtles keep him occupied during the shampooing and what not, therefore, they're okay by me! Totally safe and drain proof 
these toys don't hold water. they're colorful and cute. they are also pretty durable when dropped 
We used the Floppy Seat for a couple of years when our daughter was young. It was extremely easy to use. No, I didn't usually install it with one hand while holding my daughter (although I did a few times - it's not that hard); I normally parked near a cart, put the cover on ran the belt through, THEN took my daughter out of her car seat placed her in the shopping cart. (Why carry your baby heavy diaper bag through the parking lot if you don't need to! :-) ) It was a bit stiff to get into the stuff sack at first, but after one or two washings, it was a cinch to put it in the stuff sack when we were finished using it. It fit all the shopping carts we used, including the oversized ones at Costco. It's held up well to repeated washings - a bit faded, but still looking fairly bright. There was hardly a time that we went shopping that someone didn't come over say "Oh! I wish we'd had one of those when my children were small". Overall, we were very pleased with this product 
Great product for those grubby shopping carts. Suitable grocery carts at Target, Ingles, Kroger, Wal-Mart. etc and it's easy buckle your infant in it.. Hard work, right? nahh.. Throw it over your shoulder and walk in the store. You don't even realize it. Pop it on cart and buckle your child in the seat. Boom... It fluffy, comfortable, clean, lockable secure seat belt.. You're ready to go! 
I use this every time I go to the store. This is probably one of the most important items I have purchased for my kids. It keeps them germ free and is nice and cushioned for when they are babies and can't sit real well yet. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Buy it, you will love it. It is made really well 
I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts. I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs. Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts. Oh well. Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed. I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car. I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way, but it didn't matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form. A great baby shower gift 
I started out with a different shopping cart cover that I bought at the grocery store. It worked ok, but it didn't work at all at Costco because the carts are extra wide. I bought the floppy seat and it works like a charm. It's the only one I've found that's wide enough for the Costco and Sam's Club carts. And, it's fluffy, comfy, and easy to use. Regarding the one reviewer's comment - yes, you do have to feed the strap through the back - but every shopping cart cover out there requires you to do that. I can't get it on with one hand, but it's big enough that I can put it in the seat, put my son in the seat, and then get it perfectly situated once he's sitting and strapped in. My only complaint is that it's pretty big, but if it were smaller it probably wouldn't fit the big carts - which is why I like it so much in the first place. Plus, it covers every inch so my very curious son can't find random shopping cart or highchair spots to suck 
We started out with a Baby Bjorn after my son was born that a relative gave us. It was fine for the first few months but, once he hit 17 lbs the shoulder pain was just out of control. We did a bunch of research online and found lots of positive reviews for the Ellaroo Mei Hip. I ordered it and have truly never looked back. It is so incredibly comfortable, even now when he is far heavier. (He is nearly a year old now.) All of the weight is down on my hip and I regularly walk the 3 mile path around the lake by my house with him on my hip with very little effort and no pain. It also packs so small light that it is really easy to keep in the diaper bag and pull out whenever we get somewhere in the car. A great product 
This product is really a great idea- it's also well made. Sadly, it worked for about 10 minutes with our 3 year old daughter- she figured out how to get it off. Certainly a recommended item to those whose children don't like playing the "Houdini escape artist" routine. 
the best when you're traveling and don't want to waste much space. Will definitely buy it again 
These bags are GREAT! My son had an extended NICU stay so I pump exclusively and have to be very careful with hygiene. With these I can quickly and easily sterilize my pump attachments, his bottles, his pacifiers or even a couple of his toys. All I do is add some water, microwave, drain and done. No boiling water, no timing, no accidentally melting things on the bottom of the pot, no hassle with complicated electronic sterilzers, and almost no storage space! Each bag is good for around 20 uses then you toss it out and get a new one, so a package of them lasts quite a while. Very handy when traveling too, since many hotels and gas stations have microwaves so you can sterilize what you need to on the go without trying to haul a bunch of junk around with you 
I nursed my now 4-year-old daughter for almost a year and pumped daily. I hated always having to boil the pump for 20 minutes, which was also tough on the pump's plastic parts, which would yellow until I replaced them. Now I am nursing my 3-month-old son. I was thrilled to find these micro-steam bags! I use them not only to sterilize the pump after each use, but also for bottles. (Though I pump daily, I only occasionally use bottles, so always boiled them, too - this is sooooooo much easier!) I am so glad they came out with this product - it just makes things a lot easier! And it's so inexpensive, too! 
The micro-steam bags are wonderful. I use them at work and when travelling and they make cleaning/sterilizing so much easier and faster. I use them on my pump parts, bottles, nipples, pacifiers... anything that can be microwaved. Definitely worth the very small price 
This is a wonderful wrap and my baby loves it. It can be tricky to figure out the best fit, but comes with helpful instructions. I also like the nice big pocket in the front. My back hurts a bit, but I am still figuring out the best way to wear it. The important thing is that my baby is happy and secure in it. 
It's so comfy and much easier than you might expect. I wear it all the time 
Not much to it, just a swatch of cloth really. But it does what it says it does 
This is a great product for any parent. I love how easy it is once you get the hang of how to get it on (watch the included video) and how cuddly my newborn is when I get her in it. I can cook, take a walk or just sit on the couch and feel like I don't have to worry about her head flopping all over or hanging on to her. She loves the closeness and so do I! I live in Texas and can say that so far it's not too hot. I liked the one I got for a gift so much I ordered another 
If you are going back to work and pumping full time you will probably want to go electric, but as far as hand pumps go, this one is great. Great suction if you put it together right (there is a little piece that if you put it in upside-down you get frustratingly little suction if any at all.) The cup is comfortable though it does puddle a small amount. I have not noticed any other leaks in this unit. It is small, compact and able to produce 4 ounces in under 15 minutes 
I went to work when my son was 7 months old. I origionally bought a pump that was electric and manual. It was HORRIBLE! I looked on Amazon and found this one! It was great having it all, so I took it to work, and on every break, I'd use it! It was really nice to have 
I have been using the Avent On-the-Go pump set for over 4 1/2 months now, and I think the pump is very easy to use. I find it very comfortable, and am easily able to pump 4 or more ounces in under 10 minutes. I used a Medela electric pump (I do not know which model) once and found the Avent Isis manual pump allowed me to pump more milk in less time. The *only* thing I would suggest is for new mothers (and their significant others) to practice assembling the pump a few times prior to the arrival of their little one. I found that in the first week of my baby's life I was too overwhelmed to sit down and read the Avent instructions on how to put the pump together correctly. 
Good design makes me happy. When, as parents, we can still enjoy good design, I am even more happy. This bottle drying rack is greta to look at, well designed for use, and very convenient. yay 
I love these bottles! Easy to use, easy to clean....I can actually pump about 5.5 oz. of milk into them, and I can tuck one into my purse if needed. 
These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles. If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain. I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts. I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc. If you have a bunch of bottles anyway, you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $4 and use those instead. 
These sturdy containers make storing and feeding breastmilk very simple. I am using a combination of bags and these containers, but these are the easiest so far. Great choice if using the Avent system for bottlefeeding/pumping 
The avent bottles are better than anything else for storage. I used the bags, the via containers, you name it. This is by far the best way to store breast milk. Don't spend your money on anything else. You can even use the bottles to store baby food later on. You just put them in the warmer and its ready. There is no mess and nothing gets wasted. Good investment 
We used Avent with our 1st baby and loved it. Now that we are expecting another munchkin, we planning on using them again. I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten. (Avent's site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems) We tried other products, but Avent was the best for our family. 
Love this containers. These work well with the Avent on the Go breast pump system. I haven't had any problems with freezing them and they haven't cracked. Love the fact that they are small containers (4oz) so they freeze well and when it's time for the milk to be defrosted it doesn't take long. I plan to make my own babyfood and I am going to use these containers. LOVE THE 
I love these containers. I have the Isis breast pump and these attaqch directly to it and then I just pop in the disk and freeze. I don't have a problem defrosting them at all, just soak in warm water. Although I do try to defrost ahead of time if I know I'll need to use it 
I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out. I love these containers for this use. I don't have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar. I gave these 4 stars because I didn't get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer (which is why I registered for them in the first place). It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles. I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer 
I love this chair. Not only is it comfy cozy for a newborn but to finally have something pink for a girl is great. The only downside is that my daughter loves the vibration and it shuts off after only 15 minutes and it wakes her up?!?!? It also EATS batteries, I have had it for 5 weeks and have replaced the 4-C batteries 3 times 
Okay, the day we arrived home from the hospital we put her in this seat and she slept for hours, she loves this chair. The downside to this chair is that it cost 50+ dollars to begin with, and then you have to replace the batteries once a week, 3 C batteries (which isn't cheap)! We have spent well over 15 dollars in batteries in the 2 weeks that we have been home, and we only turn the chair on when she is fussy, it doesn't run all of the time. But, if you can afford to run out and get batteries every 4 days or so, this chair is awesome. It is very soft, and she loves it. I am not sure what we would have done without it 
My baby also has to have cereal thickened formula for his really bad reflux (as ordered by his doctor i might add). These nipples work great as long as the formula is too thick to use in a regular stage 1 or 2 nipple. The only problem i have found with these nipples is that you have to be gentle when you are using a nipple brush to clean them so that you don't tear the y-cut opening.....2 of our nipples tore at the cuts causing the hole to become larger. But gentler cleaning and checking the nipples before each use has remedied this problem. Also want to add that my son started using these nipples at the age of 2 months and has had no problems sucking from them. 
I have had this stroller for a little over a year now, and it is an awesome stroller! I have not had the "wobbly" or hard-to-steer problem at all. I have had my son in it since he was 4 months old (he is 20 months now), and it is still very sturdy. I had a Graco Quattro Tour for 2 days and took it back...it was too big, and way too big of a hastle to get in and out of the car. I can put my Aria in and out of my SUV with one arm and it opens and collapses VERY easily (like any stroller, it takes a little practice). I bought a mommy canvas tray for drinks and keys, no big deal...and I have always been able to fit my diaper bag and a few small shopping bags in the under-carriage. We are expecting baby #2 and are registering for the Twin version. I highly recommend the Aria, if you are a mom that is more about having a light-weight stroller. 
LOVE that this stroller is so light weight. I purchased this stroller for our second child. I wanted something super light since I would have 2 kids to trek around with. I was tired of the big Evenflo travel system I had from our first child. I can take this in and out of the car easily with one hand. I've never had an issue with the steering as others have stated. There were some complaints about the harness. It sounds to me that they just did not read the directions. I use the 5 point harness everytime I put my daughter, now 20 months, in the stroller. The harness is simple to use and is very secure. The stroller hood is easy to keep clean/dry. Any liquid that drops on the fabric just beads up, you can wipe or flick it off. I even ran over this stroller with our minivan and it works as well as the day we bought it. The snack tray bent, but that was the only dammage to stroller. I was easily able to order a replacement. The only complaint I have is the lousy adult cup holder hanging from one side of the handlebar. It doesn't stay in place, and my water bottle slips out easily. I did see this stroller at Sea World last weekend. I saw a Peg Aria with a tray and cup holder that extends to each side of the stroller just below the handlebar. Check with Peg. I would definately puchase this stroller again 
I had a Combi until a few days ago, I loved it but the basket was just too small, it was the net kind. I also wanted a snack tray for my one-yr old son. Also I felt that my son was already growing out of it. I did alot of research, wanted a light, easy-to-handle stroller and a bit bigger than my Combi. I purchased the Aria a few days ago, after ALOT of steering in the store, with my son in it. I found no problem with the steering, as a matter of fact it was so easy to steer, even with one hand. My son has more elbow room in his new stroller, and the snack tray is great. I don't use the 5pt harness much, but the times that I have I had no problem with it. The basket is great, lots of room. As far as the cup holder for the parent, it isn't big by any means, but I never carry around a 32 oz big gulp, so it isn't a problem for me. I usually have a small bottle of water or small Starbucks cup. Unless you travel with large cups or bottles, it works just fine. I am very happy with this stroller, the weight of it and carrying handle are both wonderful 
My sister is always losing the binkies for her babies so I bought her a paci pod in every color and she was so excited! Now she has one on her diaper bag, her purse and on the crib. I don't have kids but I like it so much I use it for my keys 
It is wonderful deal for the price. I especially like the safety feature t-bar that holds the child in without the tray 
Once assembled, this high chair is functional. Assembling it was rather difficult but overall, this high chair serves the purpose 
I bought this because my 18-month-old grandson whom I am raising started having fits when it came time to change his diaper. This really helped to make diaper changing a breeze. Even though it states you should use the packages you can just put a stack of wipes in although sometimes you have to add water on them to keep them moist but it works like a charm. I always thought baby wipe warmers were just another gimmick because I did not have them when my kids were growing up but it sure helped to solve his problem. Thanks so much for a great product. 
After reading over reviews of nearly every wipe warmer out there, including Prince Lionheart brand, we decided to go ahead and buy this one and we are SO HAPPY WITH IT! Since you leave the wipes in their plastic they do not dry out at all! The wipes are so nice and warm and our son LOVES THEM! He can actually sleep through diaper changes and he is only 2 weeks old! This model warms from the top so it doesn't dry out the wipes and there is actually liquid still left in the plastic by the time we run out and change to a new pack of wipes! We go through an 80 pack refill per week with no problems whatsoever and you DO NOT add any water or anything to this warmer - just plug it in and leave it plugged in and pop in some wipes. ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE is that there is a mechanism in this warmer that keeps the wipes pushed to the top so you never have to reach down in there to get wipes - a hard to find feature with warmers! They do not brown and they are perfectly warm for about 10 seconds out of the warmer - plenty of time to wipe their bottoms off! We HIGHLY recommend this warmer - it is THE BEST in our opinion as new parents 
LAs bases para mantener un mamon esteril son fundamentales en los viajes y solo con este kit encontre la manera de adquirilos, ademas las pachas son fabulosas.. 
I used these bottles with my first son and they were wonderful. They never leaked which is mentioned in many other reviews. In fact, they were the only bottles I found that never leaked. The nipples made an easy transition to bottlefeeding from breastfeeding. I now have a second child on the way and have already stocked up on Avent bottles 
Okay first off I didn't get this from babiesrus because they wanted to charge an arm and leg to ship it. However I got a great deal on it at babysupermall.com , I ordered it the week of christmas and got it that same week. Shipping was free and thats great when you have to purchase something you can't see in person. I love it! Looks really adorable in a white crib. Very good quality and the colors on it would go great in a lavendar or pink room. We did our daughter's room in a dark pink at bottom with white chairrail, light pink above chairrail and white crown molding. Add in the wall decorations and other accessories and its tooooo cute. Go to the website I mentioned to find ALL accessories for this. Also you'll save in the pocketbook in shipping, especially if you want the whole collection 
We just came back from vacation over the holidays and used the TOTEaTOT for the first time. It was a lifesaver! I purchased it right before we went away because I had been agonizing about how we were going to manage all the logistics of maneuvering through the airport with all of the gifts were were bringing along, plus our luggage and ourselves, without losing one of our kids in the process!  It worked just as it promised. It was easy to attach the suitcase to the car seat. Our son was happy as a clam getting wheeled through the airport. We could easily bring his car seat on the plane without having to lug it through the airport! A car seat is a must-have on the airport for a happy child and happy neighboring passengers! We were able to carry our gifts as carry-on because we didn't want to check them, and we brought a carry-on suitcase in case our other checked luggage was lost, we'd at least have the essentials for our little one and the rest of us.  We had no problems with it at all. It had pockets for us to store my son's bottle, and we were able to use the backpack portion of the TOTEaTOT to hold his diapers and some toys. I read another review where they experienced an issue with a buckle, but we had no problem at all, and in fact, I was worried that we were perhaps over-weighing it because all the stuff we had hanging off our roller suitcase (besides just the TOTEaTOT, car seat and our son, like my handbag, and a laptop computer), but again, no problems at all. Just lots of smiles and curious faces in the airport!  I'd highly recommend it.
