0	this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks . the title of the book is a little deceiving , the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits . chapters 1-4 are about general info , such as you must buy and sell to make money , do n't hold for a long time . you must research the stock before purchase , eps must increase every year . i did n't find anything in those chapters that i did n't already know . chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell . once again , the author talks about the obvious ; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip . chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques , the bull put spread . this is not something that i use or will use in my trading . chapter 12 is the concluding chapter
0	more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas . the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i would n't make that connection having read a few of faulkner 's works . sturgeon uses many of faulkner 's narrative trademarks ( i.e . streaming conscious , first person perspective of low iq individuals , disorienting changes in first person narrative ) but i did n't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying . i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously . this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books . more than human is slow , dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others . so the idea might of been original in the 50 's but topics like telekenesis , esp , computer-brain babies , and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before ( asimov ) and since . this book rarely set off that wow ! button in my head or kept me turning pages . this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best . in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book ( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 ) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting ( in this example ) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society ca n't really be ignored . besides more than human , the far superior the caves of steel , childhood 's end , and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi . needless to say , more than human did not win ( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so ) bottom line : i wanted to like this book and it does n't surprise me that others give it such high praise . these are probably people that do n't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
1	i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part . he started by telling us that he was leaving and was n't going to tell anyone . he did n't even say goodbye to a lady friend . so he tells us that he 's leaving and then he goes back into the past . back when he was a little kid . he tells about different experiances . how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years . he tells about all the troubles that his family went through . the end was the best part . i usually hate the endings but this one was good . this bool is meant for older people who like english books . or is it ireland . i think it was set in irelan
0	this book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses . i practically wore mine out over a year-long course , and came to know it intimately . dummit and foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples . of course , examples are very important . however , the explanations are often muddled and not clear ( e.g . see tensor products ) . they frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises , and the organization is poor . consequently , it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them . also , the bindings on this book frequently fail . my book fell apart very quickly , and i know other students who had the same problem . i recommend rotman 's advanced modern algebra instead of dummit and foote .
0	this poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of sister north . in the end , we really do n't care if she ever returns . the ending is cliched and predictable . a waste of time
1	i was shocked to open this book and find the author 's words targeting the very soul of my writing . it is a book about craft , not a pop culture `` i wan na write a book '' manual.gerard shows a great understanding of the motivation behind the need and desire to write well . he speaks to those who are willing to put effort and excellence where their pen meets the page.i heartily recommend this book
1	the title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly do n't need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful . i do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide . basically , if you do the least bit of original design in your work - altering an element or two , changing colors around - or if you do whole original works ( but have n't actually gone to art school ) this book is extremely useful . it covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist . you can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course , or pick and choose sections as needed . if you wonder why some of your works look great and others look , well , not as great , this book is for you
0	well , the fact that i 'm writing a review about this book , while it 's sitting open on my desk next to my computer , open and not being read , might be some evidence of how i 'm enjoying this book . this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which should n't be so difficult . this book is not clear or easy to understand at all . every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote , and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page ( ! ) , making this work look like a research project for a phd publication . i have the casebook in this series , and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity . and it turns to be true ! this book might be good if you 're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail , or as an advanced reference later on , to look something up like in an encyclopedia . some concepts , which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book . it 's too complex for a first-year student . sometimes it starts describing the different views out there , and then there 's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is . i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors .

1	this is hawking 's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math . while still not an easy read , it it much easier than the brief history of time that he wrote for laypeople before this . a person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book , as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field . older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth
1	in self-hypnosis for women c. alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument , a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis . the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words . provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human . while true to its title , self-hypnosis for women , offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to `` experiences '' idiosyncratic to women : menstruation , pregnancy , labor and delivery , and menopause , the title of this work belies its more universal `` applicability '' to components of life common to both women and men : self image ; pain management ; overcoming fear and anxiety , and finding personal balance . the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers . those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters . those who are new to the practice of hypnosis , or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others ' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters . the story of hypnosis , and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework , from mesmer , charcot and freud , to the contributions of hilgard , hull , and milton h. erickson ; they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions , including their own paths , on which they are about to embark . the simpkins define suggestion as `` a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action , experience , attitude or concept . ( p.45 ) '' this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self-guide . together , the book and cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools , assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance . specific hypnotic techniques , are explained , and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure . the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an `` experiment '' with that particular technique , creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure . the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence . there is only a place to try , adjust , and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort . more than a `` bonus '' the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own . again , mixing explanation with experiential learning , this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method , to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration . a vast canvas is provided , upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor , auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance , rather than direction or interference , a respectful approach not always found in `` self-hypnosis '' recordings . sharon mclaughlin ma , managing editor , milton h. erickson newsletter

1	college stoner cult following aside , hunter s. thompson 's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february . thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material , counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment . on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say , the average wwe heavyweight title match , for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back . hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass -- although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s -- but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious . the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor 's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting `` four more years ! '' was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while . how does the cliche go -- `` the more things change , the more they stay the same '' ? after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon , hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern 's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee , thomas eagleton . just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern 's running mate , two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions . as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press , mcgovern 's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover . since then , we 've seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates , and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic `` mascot '' will be for the 2008 race . perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton ? a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap ? but i digress . i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book , like presidential campaigns themselves , can at times seem uneventful . thompson addresses this from time to time , wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix . other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics . for instance , hst 's extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns , where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates , reads like hieroglyphics to me .

0	this book is out of rint for one reason , it is terrible . i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says . she blames pg for the destruction of the environment , mistreating employees , the role of women in society and racism . pg has done many things wrong , most big companies have , but it is not the cause of the fall of western society
0	this book reads like a horror novel . by allowing her dogs ( as well as another one in her care ) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads , the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals ' welfare . not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors , and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps . oh , and let 's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author 's choice not to spay and neuter her animals . this book moves at a peppy pace , and might have been interesting ( albeit morally reprehensible ) if the author 's `` observations '' actually provided any insight . but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author 's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence . case in point : she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one 's litter of puppies . oops ! any genuine dog lover ( or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense ) will despise this book . a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head : if `` feelings '' are your road map to life , you might enjoy this book . if you regularly take your brain out for walk , forget it . calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling `` jonathan livingston seagull '' the definitive text on marine fowl
1	i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you 're facing in your own relationships are commonplace . they 're not dysfunctional . every family has its share of issues and you do n't need to feel overly guilty for yours . the book 's underlying theme is that families that honesty , consideration , character , belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience , can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it 's probably ( though not always ) worth the effort . stories include : resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up ; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife , the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead ( and the effect on kids ) , dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage , how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you , dealing with the death of a child , how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing , etc . although it may seem that most people can not relate to these situations ... actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life ( with all it 's frustrations and headaches ) and balance it with everything . if you have any relationship , friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration , resignation about then i strongly recommend this book . it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
1	if you are looking for ideas and techniques this is a wonderful book . very well done
0	is n't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say , `` yeah ! yeah ! that 's me ! '' and then gives you no answer , or a weak one to which you say , `` no duh ! '' i 'm afraid this book is one of them . the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you 've only dreamed of , or at least point you in the right direction to get started ! but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we ca n't have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven . i do n't believe that 's the abundant life jesus promised . so i went to the bible . ( i should have gone there first ! ) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer . `` delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ! '' ps . 37:4 so i set out to seek him . i started reading `` knowing god '' by j.i . packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire ! i hope you 'll find them too-in him

0	the professionals in the law field in this book are n't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become . i understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school , but this book is ridiculous . it shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk ? give me a break
0	`` salvador '' completely discredits joan didion and all of her books . the two weeks she is believed to have `` lived '' in el salvador was actually a mere four hours . any truths in this book , and there are but a handful , have been obtained by outside sources , not by her own `` research . '' i lived in el salvador when she came in to gather info for her story . it is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the salvadorans to effect personal gain . if you want to read fiction , go ahead . she 's a good storyteller . as a service to yourself , however , keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes . the only reason i have the book at all is that my father gave it to me . what a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash
0	mr. dennett 's book demonstrates the ignorance , irrationality , and dishonesty of humanists . discussing the meaning of word materialsim , professor dennett says : `` in its scientific or philosophical sense , it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial -- like a cartesian soul , or `` ectoplasm '' -- or god . the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic , which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance , matter and ... whatever minds are supposedly made of . '' ( p. 302 ) philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics . a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence . the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism , it is naturalism . materialism is the view that all that exists is matter . materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena . ( in a quote below , you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in . ) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist , but he is certainly a naturalist . concerning the proof of god 's existence , he trots out david hume 's `` who made god ? '' which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality . i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof . let 's look at two quotes , the first is at the end of the chapter `` belief in belief '' and the other at the beginning of the chapter `` morality and religion '' : `` that is , is n't it true that , whether or not god exists , religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy , in the rule of law , in free will ? the very widespread ( but far from universal ) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning . '' ( p. 245 ) `` without the divine carrot and stick , goes this reasoning , people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires , beak their promises , cheat on their spouses , neglect their duties , and so on . there are two well-known problems with this reasoning : ( 1 ) it does n't seem to be true , which is good news , since ( 2 ) is is such a demeaning view of human nature . '' ( p. 279 ) in the first chapter , he mentions `` bulwark of morality '' and `` meaning . '' but in the second chapter , he leaves out `` meaning . '' if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven , what is our purpose is life ? whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief . mr. dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians . there are worse things than divorcing your spouse . disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said . mr. dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life . the only miracle mentioned in mr. dennett 's book is the shroud of turin , which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man . since no one claims to know how the image got there , it can be called a miracle . however , mr. dennett does not tell us anything about it . the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet .
0	to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book . one hardly knows where to start . perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel . as such , it is n't even a decent trashy novel ; instead of steamy sex scenes , we get sanctimonious sermonizing . worse than that , what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book , ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late . the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized . even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario ( an idea with virtually no scriptural support ) , little in the characters ' actions , thought processes or dialog rings true . one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student . god ends up looking like the ultimate villain , demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else . whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear ? who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis , or catherine marshall , and why are n't they getting more attention ? these were writers who actually made you think . lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing ; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought . they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask . one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all , or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter . these days , it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson , whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted , bigoted caricature of what it once was . perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured . if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers , then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind
1	i teared when i read parts of the book , but it is such an awesome book ! i did n't want to put that book down until i was completely finished reading it . i definetely recommend it to anyone with children . i loved it , and i plan on keeping up with my letter box to my son
0	the author makes a couple of valuable points . first , any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent `` secular '' ( i.e. , indefinitely long ) bear markets . most leading investment advisors recommend a `` buy and hold '' strategy , but this only works during predominately bull market periods . most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market , which is anomalous in historical terms . the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that `` buy and hold '' does n't always provide the best returns . obviously , then , it 's better to pull out during the bear markets , but that 's easier said than done . the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets , including p/e ratio , interest and inflation rates , and gdp . the problem is that those characteristics do n't always correlate with market performance . for example , this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market . well , if you heeded his advice , you would have missed the bull market of 2004 , 2005 and early 2006 , especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks . even with high p/e ratios , a bull market can continue for several years : witness the late 90s . it 's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis . there is so much volatility on a daily , weekly , monthly , and yearly basis that 's it 's impossible to know when the market has switched directions . by the time that it is apparent , it 's too late to profit . even in the midst of great bull markets , there might be week , month , or even year-long downturns . the author says nothing about individual stock picking , beyond a general value approach . the book is all about big picture , long term trends . another problem is that the author 's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900 . but the market ( and economy ) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s , 50s , 60s , and 70s . as they say , past performance does not predict future returns . the investment advice provided here is not useful . he suggests a `` portfolio of hedge funds , '' ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k . he also recommends a `` bond ladder , '' an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund , and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations . i do n't need to spend $ 25 and five hours reading to learn that ! one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility , which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations . volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for . most studies just average the returns across years , but that does n't reflect real returns . let 's say you invest $ 100k into a stock that returns 35 % the first year and -15 % the second . your average return should be 10 % a year , right ? wrong . at the end of the first year you have 135k . minus 15 % the second year leaves you with 115k total , equal to 7 % a year compounded . if you had received 10 % a year compounded , your final total would be over 121k . that 's 6k difference in just 2 years , and the volatility costs add up . the book is very poorly written , plodding , sooooo boring , with tons of repetition . just as an example , the graph showing the `` y curve '' relationship between p/e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times .

1	this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s . recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m work , i decided to read it . i thought the book was excellent , but maybe unnecessarily long . the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation . the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not , but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless . for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job , this book is a must . for everyone else that just likes good non-fiction , this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era
0	cruel , horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot . the abuse of children , evil ranger poising as a dead ranger , freaky religious sect , dead animals on the bed , and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me . i 've read many barr books , and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters , it 's hard to keep them straight . in this book , that was the last of my worries . i did n't even finish it , i was so turned off
1	how would you like to have to perform your own autopsy ? that is the conundrum that faces dr. maura isles in body double when she returns from a conference in france to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house . the investigation into the murder leads maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before , and also leads maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women . this book moves quickly as maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion . it 's a pleasure to see maura team up with dr. jane rizzoli -- maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of jane and jane seems to make maura a little less of an ice princess . this is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end
0	i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character . this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book , and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it , said parent would have no clue as it sure is n't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book . i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading , but this time this particular book slipped under my radar . she told me that it had a reference to a gay character , which i took to mean just a passing reference , but when i read the book , it was treated more seriously than i thought , even going so far as to have the two girls kiss . it is inexcusable , both on ms pierce 's part and on scholastic 's . no matter what the author 's personal beliefs , it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents . i believe that as a parent , i 'm the one responsible for what my children see and do , but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision . anise hollingshea
0	i have yet to read a true grisham thriller , but i plan to in the near future . having said that , i have no idea how this compares , but i did n't really care for it . it 's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that i could n't get into . i felt like i was reading a teen or children 's book , and i do n't like feeling so patronized when i read unless i knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message -- even then , i do n't usually feel patronized or `` written down to '' . it 's simple writing and a simple plot . it 's lighthearted and thus a light read . i imagine many people would enjoy it ; i just could n't get into it . : o
1	i started with the second volume , the mammoth book of more historical whodunnits , and enjoyed it so much that i went out and got a copy of this one as well . i really liked the time-span of story settings , and the best part was the mystery that was written down over 2000 years ago ! great for people who like short story mysteries , and as a lead-in to authors you might like
1	our book club read this book for our february 2006 selection . it was a really good book , we were all excited about discussing it . mr. johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think . a few members felt that denmark never loved sierra but saw her more as property . the book definitely has some suprises that you do n't see coming . we really enjoyed the book . sistahs of ebony pages
0	as a young woman i was appauled by gurian 's lack of respect for women as human beings.what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life.the resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and can not because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles.i do n't remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be . i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks.his book is full of agenda .
1	reinventing the bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader . from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market , mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers ' eyes . he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets , and in my opinion , he succeeds . each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points . while the book has an economic undertone , the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student . all terminology is explained not only with words , but with examples , as well . the book was enjoyable , especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings . however , i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book
0	let me see how many books can i write to preach to the choir about the same thing . she must of got dumped by a handful of liberal boyfriends ( what intellegent person would want her ) and now she 's trying to get back at 'em . ca n't wait for the next `` i hate liberals so much and here are my reasons why '' book . she should join fox she would fit right in
1	this book was someone else 's bookclub selection , and i think having no expectations when i picked it up really helped in my having that wow experience that some folks report with this book and others miss . yes , the prose needed much better editing : overuse of repetition , `` stock '' phrases , and `` hanging '' assertions that should have been cleaned up . however , i found the discussions of brain development/evolution , similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors , development of language in different animals , and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating ( oops , just gave away the ending ! ) . i found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening . i also liked dr. temple 's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions . great idea ! although the book really goes all over the place , i found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my `` seeking/hunting '' motivation ( you 'll have to read the book for that one ) , and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold
1	i truly enjoyed northern lights . ms. roberts ways with words are so descriptive and it kept me going with the mystery and growing love between the two characters in this book . i truly enjoy nora roberts , she is an excellent writer . i can not wait to read more of her newer writings as well as her older writings .
1	only knowing jack canfield from the very successful `` chicken soup for the soul '' mega series , i had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach . although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success , the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life . this lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit . lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions . a absolute must read book for understanding the real you
1	it is basically a short review of the great book written by zahn . i recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times
0	this book started well , but fell flat in the middle . what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through . even the shooting incident could n't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly . well , i did n't bother to finish it -- i have limited time for reading , and i do n't like to waste it .
0	at least this author mentions the `` mockery '' strategy martha/mdiddy tried to use to `` fog '' the public . the `` real issue '' of whether martha/mdiddy committed the crimes , and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question `` did martha stewart '' lie , demonstrates some complacency . is it this complacency martha/mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote ? is it the `` greyness '' of white-collar crime that martha/mdiddy was trying to play on ? is society the ultimate judge about a person 's guilt or innocence ? if so , what has martha/mdiddy been judged ? be `` thoughtful '' ~shaw
0	probability and random processes can be easily approached with grace and elegance so long as the professor and/or writer possess such talents . all too often albert leon-garcia comes across as a total wacko in the possession neither
1	in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book , hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century . the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details , witty asides , and ( especially ) luxuriously reproduced introductions . hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages ; he hopes to provide brief , non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science . there is astonishingly little text , and at times the pithiness , compactness , and occasional `` cuteness '' may work against readers ' understanding ; there 's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here . some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader . ( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time , event horizons , and brane world models . ) the text is aided greatly , however , by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations . even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first , the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design 's artwork will attract , engage , and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation . overall , then , the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated . yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further . if you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here , i strongly recommend ( as does hawking ) alan guth 's `` the inflationary universe '' or brian greene 's `` the elegant universe .
1	a wonderful wonderful book.although the book was written some 150 year ago , mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850 's as if it was occurring today . she writes from her heart with honesty , integrity and a clear mind . and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement . from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change . for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book
1	this is by far my favorite novel by forster , and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels , period . in his first book , forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i , at least , feel that he lost as he got more self-consciously `` philosophical '' in later books like howard 's end and a passage to india . he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art , bringing them to vivid life , undermining tourist cliches , and weaving them gracefully into his main themes . no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly
1	the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends . they are , in fact , historical fiction at its best . whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy , but to weave the stories into historic events . the first six novels in the series ( that is all i have read , though it appears that there are two or three more ) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend . but the beauty of the books is in whyte 's prose . a scottish poet , he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours . these books will not insult your intelligence , and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend .
0	i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book . not quite as bad as her book , `` impossible , '' but close . danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing . basically , this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he did n't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead . drivel . she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves , but no . a waste of time . very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all . disappointing , to say the least .
0	after reading the trilogy , i was left wondering what the hell happened ? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker . pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i 've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy . there is n't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess . if you look up `anticlimax ' in the dictionary , you 'll see a picture of this book . from first page to last , time is wasted on boring characters , while all the good ones are either killed off , or just mia for the entire book . spoilers ahead . what about lyra and her parents ? somehow , she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl ? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations . and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops . over a cup of tea , naturally . and that 's it for him . in addition to all that , this book does n't even seem to be connected to the first two . none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends , will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages . what happened to the story , for cripes sake ? ! and what happened to the `temptation ' ? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it ? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with . as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries did n't endanger the universe , why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other . the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another . supposedly , they had more than gonads going for them , they survived death together ! pullman did n't feel like thinking it through , he just wanted a gut wrenching ending . in addition to that , he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality ' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning . all of will and lyra 's efforts are futile , kind of like - guess what ? religion for the rest of us morons . after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever , ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper . iorek byrnison , lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun . pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter ! this is not children 's literature , it 's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess . it 's totally dishonest to sell this as a children 's book , or even as a competent work of fiction . all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one . we never get closure on lyra 's parents . we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from . we never see will reunited with his mother . we get a lame battle where `god ' dies and no one even knows why or how . lyra and will fall in love , but have to `sacrifice ' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever , with only flimsy reasoning behind it . the mulefa and mary malone 's work together amounts to nothing , everyone just goes home . presumably , will goes home , although we never see it . all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing . the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon ? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea . it all just sort of disovles . mary forgot to be the serpent , or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa . another reader pointed out : `` phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series . instead , the story falls flat under the weight of the author 's own agendas and mockeries . what a waste of time . i ca n't believe this book actually won awards . it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly . '' it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream . instead , relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime . absurd . this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life .
0	this book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game . that 's about it . no instruction on create a wrestler , or for that matter , create anything . in fact , the previous two items i listed ( moves and storylines ) are pretty much the only content in this book . i do n't know ; maybe i 'm spoiled by prima and the good job they do writing for pc games . they just could have included a lot more content , that 's all . you could have found any old faq in 30 seconds of search-engine poking
0	i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie . the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face . one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel . it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves . the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction , apparently oprah 's as well
0	the content is excellent . the digital format is largely useless . i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition . but , the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca n't print selected pages to stick in a folder , read on the train , or scribble notes on . i ca n't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes ' file . the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one
1	'the interface between the written and the oral ' is a comprehensive look at the development of writing in general and alphabets in particular , oral poetry in ancient greece and modern africa , oral transmission of ( written ) vedas , the impact of writing on recently oral cultures in west africa , and the impact of writing on our own abilities of thought and organization . perhaps the most disheartening , but nonetheless informative section , deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy . they seem to be lacking in common sense . goody , however , is full of common sense , and this book is excellent reading
0	i really did n't enjoy this book . i am half italian-american , and i 've read a few books about growing up in an italian-american family in an effort to learn about my roots . i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is `` normal '' and their immigrant parents . i normally enjoy such books , but not this one . i know that life was n't always a bowl of cherries for these familes , but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible . yet , i could n't find anything about the daughters ' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people 's lives in this country . where is all the anger coming from ? i really do n't know . this book is dark and depressing . some say it is funny at times , but i did n't think so . i could n't even bring myself to finish it
1	i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer ... is that logical at all ? ? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father ? if he had the senator when he was twenty he 'd have to be 77 . is it really reasonable that he 's running around killing people , and setting houses on fire . it was a very unlikely twist to the end . it still was a good book
0	ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology , so she attacks without understanding . she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people 's work she denigrates . maslow 's hierarchy of needs is one example . i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings . i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers , and william coulson as instructors . any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them . she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book . her bias is extreme and obvious . so consider this when reading the book . no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs . i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology
1	this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult . the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-christian origins of the marian cult . other resources , however , cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so-called `` bvm '' . the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west . the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church
0	reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it . for one thing , the author still talks about the ussr and east germany , and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated . it 's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future .
0	the content of this book is adequate , but the layout leaves much to be desired . the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents . pages are not labeled with chapter information , such as which chapter that page belongs to . the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half . this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book . you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused . if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book , i would rate it much higher
0	some of the stuff in here was really screwy . it 's not a handbook to the `` food and mood '' book by elizabeth somer , which is what i thought it was when i bought it . it 's a separate program entirely . this one is too woozy and non-western for me . very little hard data to back up what they say , just kind of fruity and flowery
1	rather a funny novel , gets off to a slow start but the end is superb . worth reading
1	this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted . the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows . the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses , that is the only way i can discribe it . there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat , and then others that are . there is a section on warstriders , basicly single man `` death machines '' that basicly look like large metal robots . most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like . i do n't like saying that is what they look like because , well , this is rping people , things change by a player/gm 's perception . anyway , enough of my ramblings , this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders . this book is about gear in the world of exalted . p.s . it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books . my best guess is that one will be for sorcery , but that is just one book . if you think of anything else , post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones
1	we are in the last part of the 19th century in this novel , and the wild west has breathed its last . the book is peopled with real legends ( calamity jane , buffalo bill , sitting bull ) and fictional curiosities ( jim ragg and bartle bone - two mountain men , and no ears - an indian with exceptional eyesight ) . mcmurtry relates a sad , elegiac farewell to times past . the ever-interesting characters and their views of the world , which are wise and funny and fascinating , make the novel top-notch in the mcmurtry canon
1	eoghan casey 's text is immediately useful . it 's not theory , it 's practical . it 's not biased to one operating system , but covers several technologies . finally , eoghan and the book 's contributors do not gloss over today 's most offensive topics , they address them with vigor and solutions . i would share one concern : the chapter-long product/vendor discussion . some reviewers label it marketing ; other reviewers do n't mention it at all . i 'll just forewarn you that you will learn much more about encase or nfr than about their competitors . as a security consultant for hewlett-packard , it seems my bookshelf fills up entirely too easily , especially as of the last few years . therefore , i 've gotten fairly selective with new book purchases ( until i can get a new bookshelf ) . however , casey 's text is definitely worth getting - worth knocking another book off to make room . : ) i hope you enjoy this comprehensive text at least half as much as i do
0	a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book , because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life . in the end i was very disappointed . not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book , but michael crichton 's whole attitude . he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences , only to revert back to his arrogant , narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter . how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in ? sadly , this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth . i have no desire to read any more of his books
1	with every grisham book i read , i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense , but to insert other elements to make this human as well . for once , we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain . however , this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune . however , she does not know this . a lawyer is sent to find her , and in the process , undergoes a fundamental change of his own . this story takes place in washington , maryland , west virginia , and the rain forests along the brazilian-bolivian border . in typical grisham fashion , he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book , enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes . you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions . you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight . you can envision the rainforest , and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley . this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue . the pages literally turn themselves . do not start this novel before going to bed , or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down .
1	when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop , i decided at once that i needed to own it . it 's large , it 's bulky , but it 's beautiful . it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom 's works . as an artist myself , who learnt a lot from tom 's unique techniques , i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art , both colour and black and white , has been compiled into this collection . but it 's not just pictures ; there 's an insight into the man himself , a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art . this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists , like myself , waiting for recognition
0	this book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating ... well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle . read `` the fat fallacy '' instead , it provides much more practical information
1	noah webster 's book is fascinating reading for today 's students and teachers alike , as well as for the average citizen , as there is much to learn from it . while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text , it certainly has a place in every school library . one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used , with diacritical marks ( accents ) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants ; words are divided according to syllables and stress . it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet ; something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching . the terminology of traditional grammar is used , and there are copious word lists , with words grouped according to common factors . i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects ( now-archaisms : thy/thou ... ; foreign words and phrases ; abbreviations explained ; punctuation ; etc ) . this book should remain a spelling classic
1	at first , i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church . yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story , especially since i work as a mental health professional . as i keep reading , i discovered that it was n't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope , of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child , and of the intrusive nature of the media . i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict , despite her past history of nervous breakdown . and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man . the secondary characters were all wonderful , in particular mariah 's mother and the lawyers on both side . i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story . as with all picoult books , this was a deep and heavy novel which was n't easily breezed through , but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read !
0	i can not stand this book . i ca n't even finish reading it . kevin j anderson can not write original star wars books at all . the only thing i have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the dark lords of the sith comic book . everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story . he seems to have some obsession with death stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those . darksaber , jedi search , dark apprentice , champions of the force , heck even the ig-88 story he wrote for tales of the bounty hunters had the death star tied in ( ig-88 transfers himself into the death star ... what the heck ? ) seriously , this book is not worth it . try timothy zahn or michael stackpole . at least they do n't always use death stars . and while zahn 's last 3 books are based around thrawn , the original heir to the empire , dark force rising and the last command , when thrawn first appeared , was not him dry humping the same concept over and over
1	as i began to read this book , i was reminded of jack dempsey 's observation that `` champions get up when they ca n't . '' all of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome . most of the examples which jeffrey sonnenfeld and andrew ward cite in this book involve ceos who either `` fired back '' and eventually prevailed after a career setback ( e.g . donald trump , martha stewart , bernie marcus , jimmy carter , and george foreman ) or never fully recovered from them ( e.g . jill barad , john scully , leona helmsley , jacques nasser , and linda warnaco ) . the former demonstrate the importance of `` seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph '' which sonnenfeld and ward recommend ; the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five-step strategy - `` for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback '' -- is based . it would be a disservice to sonnenfeld and ward as well as to those who read this brief commentary if i were to list the `` lessons '' and `` steps '' which are best revealed within the narrative of this remarkably thoughtful , eloquent , and practical book . each is anchored in a real-world context . each is relevant to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional career . i mention this last point because some who consider purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material will be of greatest value only to senior-level executives . on the contrary , all of sonnenfeld and ward 's observations and recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who wishes to ( a ) avoid `` a devastating professional setback '' or ( b ) recover from one . in essence , this book provides sonnenfeld and ward 's response to this question : `` how can i overcome a professional setback ? '' to their credit , at no time do they minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback . ( presumably each has experienced a few of his own . ) they fully appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating psychological stress of failure , the challenges of failure to one 's reputation ( both personal and professional ) , social biases about failure , and other challenges which may be unique to one 's company , its culture , and its industry . if not `` tragic '' or `` devastating , '' a setback almost always lowers one 's self-esteem , is embarrassing , and has adverse financial consequences . more often than not , there is collateral damage to one 's family members and/or to one 's close colleagues at work so guilt also comes into play . recall the dempsey quotation provided earlier . presumably sonnenfeld and ward agree with dempsey on the importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to summon the courage to `` get up '' when you are convinced that the situation is not hopeless , and , that you can indeed recover if you understand what has happened , why it has happened , and how you can - and should -- respond to it . of course , it is preferable to avoid a setback in the first place . ( `` if `ifs ' and `buts ' were fruits and nuts ... . '' ) most of us are not so fortunate and i , for one , have learned the most important lessons from failures ( mine and others ' ) rather than from successes . whether or not a given failure is our `` fault , '' it is certainly our responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity it offers , and then to make positive and productive use of whatever truth has been revealed . it is interesting to examine the lives of `` great leaders [ who ] rebound after career disasters '' but , in my opinion , it is imperative to examine with rigor and candor one 's own values , attitudes , and behavior - especially when struggling to understand and then recover from a professional setback which is invariably a personal setback , also . as sonnenfeld and ward make crystal clear , this journey of personal discovery is by no means easy . nonetheless , it is one which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by persistence throughout one 's life . if and when setbacks occur - and they always do - the practical advice which sonnenfeld and ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest it to understand and ( yes ) accept what has happened , understand why it has happened , and then leverage that wisdom effectively and productively , not only in their careers but in their personal lives
0	this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class ! it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read . this book is horribly written . the explanations are boring , drawn out , and unclear . the early chapters draaaag on forever . the later chapters get a little better , but they state a lot of obvious or useless information . i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little .
0	i am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only : if you own 2nd ed. , do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors ( spellings for one ) are xeroxed onto the new edition . therefore , for a review of the text itself , you may , without any compunction , refer to 2nd ed . 's comments , of which there are many
0	having read detective comics # 471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team , i picked this up , hoping for more of the same . what a let-down ! i have to ask - what happened ! ? the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest , most detailed art i 'd ever seen in a comic-book . i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin . when he was working on x-men , he gave john bryne 's pencils that fine detail as well . has austin done a 'gil kane ' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen ? this dark detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work . you only have to compare the 'flash-backs ' of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong . maybe austin or rogers are getting older , but the artwork is very basic , and lacks the sheen they used to produce . the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane 's early work . the story also is a little unbelievable . it portrays bruce as a love-sick puppy and just does n't ring true . also , the lettering is - well , it 's been hand-done , by rogers i surmise , and is quite uneven . it should have been done by computer . i 'm sorry - i so wanted to like this , but it 's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s .
1	as a frequent reader of home design books and magazines , the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me . a quick review of the table of contents revealed that i had to have this book . pelosi begins with the basics , moves into specifics , and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune . the pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor . whether you are looking for a single design solution or , like me , enjoy reading about interior design , this is the book for you ... and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home . `` interior divine '' made my holiday shopping easier this year !
0	this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world ( eg . sports , armed forces , girl scouts , religion , nasa , etc . ) management techniques to the business world . most , possibly all , are of little value because of major differences . 1 ) members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently , and face greatly significantly different situations . what does eg . a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist , nurse , professor , financial analyst , etc. ? i have no idea . 2 ) key success factors vary from one business to another . for merck , it may be speed of developing new drugs , getting through fda approval , and motivating physicians to use them . for nucor steel , it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production . again , what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little , if anything . one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg . about wal-mart ( if you are in retailing ) , about allied-signal or g.e . ( if you are managing a conglomerate ) , and about new york community school district # 4 , as managed by sy fliegel , if you are in public school
1	the book is not 'really ' on christ in the etheric , but more several - `` unrelated '' - lectures about etheric life . sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture . the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of `` cosmic life '' if you like : the spiritual life that is connected with , and influences , life as seen only from/with physical senses . in the book is recorded about several `` ages '' ( golden age , silver age , iron age and dark age ) , and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [ or really spiritual consciousness ] - diminished with each age , and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a `` damascus experience '' ( experience of saul - later paul - in which he saw christ in etheric form ) . people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth . in this light , rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in western and eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric ( = 2nd coming of christ ( coming in the etheric ) ... and in future times coming of christ ( i.e . manifestation/presence of christ in the astral ) ) . in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount - with the beautitudes ( recorded in matthew 5 ) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul ( as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner ( sentient soul , intellectual soul , etc. ) ) . in the book is also recorded about `` the afterlife '' if you like : life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound , and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth . in the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife ' and how feelings and will are active . it is recorded about astral plane , lower devachan and higher devachan in `` etherization of the blood '' and later on again in `` three realms between death and rebirth '' where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as 'destiny ' ... and how people are so focused on what is , or has happened , but do n't pay attention to what is result of it not happening ( e.g . getting delayed for an appointment , or coming ( 'unexpectedly ' ) too early etc. ) . destiny is at work , with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner . in the book is also located about `` the double '' and how forces from within the earth influence it [ geo-biology ] . ireland was a place where those influences where most 'healthy ' for spiritual development/cognition and ireland was the place where christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to europe by irish monks
0	i truly wanted to like this book . after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i 'd feared but downright enjoyable . in addition i 'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me , and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature : `` captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last . '' alas , it was all down hill from there ; overall this is one of the worst books i 've ever forced myself to finish . this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack . author of two other published novels and a short story collection , director of a university level creative writing program , long-term teacher of writing , and holder of a ph.d. in same , all to considerable critical acclaim , she should be correcting and grading ( failing ) garbage like this not producing it . so what went wrong ? how did this novel end up so awful ? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece . there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things . length : if `` brevity is the soul of wit '' , this novel 's witlessness is easily explained . at 666 pages ( interesting number that ) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been . it would seem that , to some extent like melville before her , naslund confused length with importance , but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is . imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody . somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel , but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing ... with a meat axe or a chainsaw . the name dropping : one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures , but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend . they are badly handled here . an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne . one or two of these , developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude . as it is , it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor ( or the self-awareness ) . the politics : even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel , so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing . however , naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day ( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day ) from slavery to whaling , from feminism to free love , from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled , all without consequence or even criticism . this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves . una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today , which is to say : none . the anti-christian bigotry : there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time , but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted . it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish , the bigoted , the future apostate , or the mentally ill . it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity . the farfetched scenarios : i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter ... . after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic . after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her ( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand ) , una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle , encounters two young men who both fall in love with her , disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them , successfully avoids detection , is sunk by a whale , survives by committing cannibalism , marries the surviving young man after he goes insane , and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians , leaving her free to `` marry '' captain ahab ( una never really `` marries '' anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes ) . things do n't get more realistic in the second half , which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale . riiiight . the mary sue : however , the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a `` mary sue '' that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader . a more realistic main character might have saved it . una never learns anything from her life 's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything . she does n't change because she is already perfect . she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any , and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides , una had her reasons ( and they were very good ones you can be sure ) . the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it . i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom ... with the door locked .
1	well written and fully documented . i confess that i knew very little about the beginings of islam or its constant bloodshed . anywhere islam becomes entrenched , freedom is taken away and civilizations are destroyed . hatred is not discouraged but encouraged . islam 's world view is this in a nutshell , do it our way or perish . this book will rob you of your sleep
0	the title says it all . one can do better w/ appleyard 's book

0	dr. hawkins first book , power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts ... consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world
1	this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in new york city . necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them
1	i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also . this book is filled with suspense from page one . the book never drags in my opinion . this book though is not for the faint of heart . if you do n't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter . but if you do n't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes . the ending is by far the most suspenseful part . i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about . the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also . i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there is n't . i ca n't choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it . although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end . keep up the good work king
1	this book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that saudi arabia is the way it is today . i was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore . it does get a little tedious when discussing the business/oil aspects of the 1960 's and 70 's , but it 's well worth it . it 's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time .
1	pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics , providing examples of practical application of each . this helps the reader develop a critical mind , capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis . pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws , such as cultural and ethical relativism . the reader will find that pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular , but rather calls for reason and judgment , based on strong moral principles , in every situation . some situtations call for a utilitarian approach , some for a virtue-ethical approach . whatever approach he takes , however , will be based in thorough and sound reasoning . this book makes its readers want to be better people .
1	i 'm writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members . reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases . consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting : `` the oil states today face tremendous challenges , as oil revenues start to decline . few expected that the decline would come so soon . everybody knew it would come , but it was expected later rather than sooner . '' this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time . worth a look if you 're interested in the field
0	i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican . funny . he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement . and let 's face it : he stink bombed george h.w . bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton . i 'm not saying bush would have won if walsh had n't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election , but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush . bush got him back , of course , by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve , 1992 . the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least . as it wore on , however , it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans . let 's face it : people in power tend to be corrupt . they have protection the rest of us do n't have . this was n't just true about reagan and bush ; it 's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name . about halfway through the book , walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time , ghw bush . i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least . i guess when you ca n't beat a guy at the ballot box , you impeach him or at least try to . right ? not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside .
1	i got this book when it first came out and read it straight away.i absoloutely loved it and highly reccomend it.lief is trying to be a great ruler , but ca n't , not with the famine and death in deltora.but with a perilious map , our heroes set out to destroy the four sisters that are causing the deaths in deltora.an exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading.well done emily rodda ! i like this book as much as all the others , this is the best deltora series and i say it proudly , but after all , deltora quets has n't finished , not yet
0	this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook ( certainly by european standards ) . but the physical packaging is a total disaster . it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins . it is difficult to read text near the spine , and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page . the most unuseable book i 've ever experienced
0	this `` book '' is probably the worst written i 've ever encountered . it was so flawed as to be considered literature . alice walker tries to `` one-up '' harriet beecher stowe , in writing about brutality . titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated . all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting . the women are portrayed as martyred , forlorn , pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell . the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women . i 've learned long ago , when absolutes such as these are presented , a greater agenda is at work . there are no `` real '' men in this book ! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity . i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst . i find this title as dangerous as hitler 's `` mien kampf '' , in it 's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute . presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible . true , there are criminally abusive men in every culture . but there are also forthright , upstanding men as well . to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity , only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about . harriet beecher stowe 's fictional `` uncle tom 's cabin '' , sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war . this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men . this book is fiction . however , it is not presented as such . i 'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents . i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations . however , i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations . that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book . in my opinion , this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it . i do n't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all . i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes ... the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman . i 'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book . feminist , racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature . i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades , were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women . most definitely not ! ! ! i doubt it would have even found a publisher . america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture . my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion . whatever ms. walker 's motivations were in writing this novel , i 'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted . this is racist , misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature !
1	this is not the book to learn the basics of vbscript , but it 's exactly what i needed ; a good reference book . i got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online . now i have it at my fingertips
1	fifteen years ago i purchased this book for the first time . today i am buying it as a gift for my son . i feel i am giving him the gift of life all over again . even though i raised all my children with vitamin c added to their diets , he seems to have fallen off the `` juice '' wagon ! linus pauling was not only brilliant but clear and concise . i only wish i had known he published a book on quantum mechanics a long time ago . i shall purchase that too at last and maybe i shall have an inkling of what it is all about
1	black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies , a classic work of sociology that still resonates today . it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology , however , a school that today stands in some disrepute , at least in some circles . indirectly , it was the target of james baldwin 's famous attack on richard wright in his essay , everybody 's protest novel . the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school , due to its insistance upon using a `` scientific approach '' , merely reproduces the very terms under which african-americans have been oppressed -- a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno . still , black metropolis is a landmark study , and , unfortunately , many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today , and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse , not better , since 1945 , the year of black metropolis ' publication -- which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above , though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society . since then , as we know , we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days ; so much so , in fact , that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book . embodying american liberalism as it does -- which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago -- black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look
1	bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era . but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we 'd least like to go -- inside ourselves . i found this an incredibly powerful book . i 've used sections of it with my `` change management '' classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students , who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy . if you want a simple formula for change , do n't buy this book . although it is full of practical , actionable ideas , `` change the world '' addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for . it 's a very difficult but rewarding assignment
0	i have read all of sandra brown books . i was disappointed in this one . i have almost all of her books in my bookcase , but when i finished this one i gave it away .
1	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone . this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy . the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life . this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy . although the book is considered an educational read , i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well . it 's just an interesting book , it doesnt get much simpler than that
1	this is by far my 2 year old son 's favorite book and he has lots of them . whenever it 's time to read to him he says `` toot toot '' and i know that means he wants to have this book read to him , sometimes several times in a row . the illustrations are wonderful , and there is all sorts of stuff going on if you look closely . an all around great , fun book , i highly recommend this book
0	this is a tough read . he gets so bogged down in the details that i forgot what i was reading about
0	i try to read items that i would not necessarily agree with . however , this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations , misquotes , and spin . she uses tacky research to make points that do n't exist , then brushes off any critique as `` liberal bias '' . if you are a conservative , please read something that will allow us to discuss matters . coulters ' book should be titled `` slander : liberal lies i made up .
0	first of all , i did not exactly 'read ' this biography . instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work ( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way , and still been able to read many more technology related books ) . i had great expectations from this book , having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln . i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed . i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson , richard carwardine , or doris goodwin . i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography , but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character . in this context , i find mr mccullough 's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america . i also enjoy direct quotes from letters , speaches , autobiographies , as they help me refine my impressions of the context ( the period , the relationships to contemporary characters , ... ) surounding a promonent figure . usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams ' time , and i missed 'hearing ' the voice of john adams . instead , this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author . finally , having read other biographies of the founding fathers , i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin . all in all , my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions . had i known that , i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough 's fictional work
0	each story has a different author ... however they all use the same verbage . their either all friends or the same person . i do not like this book nor does my husband
0	i agree with the last reader . i did n't finish this book , it was so boring . nothing happened . and the characters were annoying . i read a lot of books that are n't action-oriented and like them . but this one was awful
1	i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience . i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity . it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems . i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary . it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything . ( that would have been impossible anyway ) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader ( civil rights ) and unsuccessful leader ( vietnam ) . his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me . if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the work and worship institute website . i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book . this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society .
1	i believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we 've been absorving . i think that this book was made simple , so that it would be very easy to read , understand , use and remember the `` be 's '' . it does not anti with anything , it 's just conservative with what is believed to be true ! it 's inspiring that would help anyone who reads to envision grabbing your dreams and on how lucky we are to be in this generation with full of opportunities . every chapter gives wisdom why do we have to be ; grateful , smart , involve , clean , true , positive , humble , still and prayerful
1	my son loves to read , and he adores this book . i personally love trapani 's books -- while they are not always grammatically correct ( the only reason why i do n't give it a 5 star rating ) , they are beautifully illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes . it will bring a smile to your child 's face
0	chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist , and it pains me to give this book such a low mark . it 's hard to say much without giving away the plot , but i found the plot contrived and manipulative -- too clever for its own good . the book started strong , but as the main character became more disassociated with reality , i became more disassociated with the book . i finished it , but it was a struggle
0	this book disappointed me after reading martins letters . although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity . there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez .
0	this is a good book , but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book . einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory . for instance , e=mc^2 was not created by einstein , as so many people people . an italian physicist came up with it . if you do n't believe me check any encyclopedia . einstein suceeded in taking everyone 's work and compiling it . this was helpful to the world of physics . unfortunately , this stuff is outdated , and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book . when it came out it was already outdated . this was published in the 60s . autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s ( 45 i believe ) . if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s , it would have been a good book
1	this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape , grounded firmly in love and faithfulness . it moves quickly ; i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant . the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that 's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu . and it is not transient but deepens . miriam , abu 's sister , remains with me in her moving quietude , and the litle girl lela , hand in hand with julie , plucks deep
1	received qickly and in great condition
1	lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president . this book shows that this is not even close to being true . under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world . him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america . under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices . all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money . it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book . it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book . the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program . recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency
1	everything that i 've made so far has been really really good . recipes are easy to follow and pack up nicely for next day lunches
0	i 'm a zone diet believer - but this book is a serious letdown . two major problems with this worthless book : 1 . almost all of the recipes involve *far* too much preparation - the title is *very* misleading . 2 . i find it hard to believe that anyone actually prepared these recipes , and thought they were *good* ! most of the meals are horrible due to the *huge* proportion of vegetables . i mean , an omelet with over 3 cups of asparagus ? ?
1	what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes , but no one seems to believe you ? that is the concept facing dr. thomas more , distant relation to the famous/infamous saint thomas more , in walker percy 's novel `` love in the ruins '' . the united states is at a time of crisis , but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them . it is up to dr. more , who knows how to diagnose the problem , but not necessarily treat it , to try to prevent the chaos from happening . the story begins on a hot fourth of july , with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town . in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen ; an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world . the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days , tracing doc 's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel . the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer , a sort of `` stethoscope of the human spirit '' , through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person 's soul , and finally discovers how to treat it . meanwhile , there is a revolution brewing ; the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed , if a major catastrophe does n't befall everyone before that can happen . `` love in the ruins '' is a truly southern novel , crafted through percy 's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor . the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding , even though they are frighteningly realistic , and not so far-fetched in this present day . percy 's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway ; flawed , prone to drink , forever chasing after women who are wrong for him . this novel is his coming-of-age , in a sense , because doc learns what it is he wants out of life , and how to best achieve that . subtitled `` the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world '' , `` love in the ruins '' is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near-apocalyptic america
0	im not sure where to begin with this review , its not that the book was poorly written , quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal . it was quite infact extremely boring , by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series , they were all very good from front to back . there is way , way , to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged , maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass . it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement . it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again . im giving this book 2 out of 5 , very poor story line , poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better , cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did , blown away ! ! rather than tired and exhausted
1	tony nourmand 's `` film posters of the 60 's '' is a wonderful and colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through . there are many of the classic film poster images of the french new wave , the films of stanley kubrick and the classic 007 posters , just to name a few . film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects that enthusiasm . this book was lovingly organized with great detail . a superb value ! looking forward to future editions
0	i only needed this for school a little while back . now i am marketing in hawaii at a resort and realizing this book taught me little to nothing . have fun with it if you please though
1	i requested this book for my college music class . i saw many offers from b and other book stores and i found amazon having the best price and received the book on time . the book was in great condition and my fellow students were surprised when they heard the price and the shipping response . i totally recommend this site and book for school . the book was comprehensible and well illustrated .
0	i purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and i am very disappointed . the arabic fonts used are so small that , at times , it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters . definitely , not a book for people who are new to the language
1	this book , `` the relatives came '' by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell , was a delight to read . i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive . likewise , i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit . and , i felt as if i , too , were a part of this book . having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people , i believe that when relatives come to visit , it almost seems like christmas . as a result , when the book expressed the joy , laughter , and celebration of family , it stirred up these memories of the past . unquestionably , almost anyone , from children to adults , could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit .
0	`` tourists are learning that the image of the terrible turk is false , created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors . turks are quick to remind visitors that , surrounded by syria , iraq , iran , armenia , georgia , bulgaria , and greece , they 're not living in mr. rogers ' neighborhood . '' this is a direct quote . it sounds like they 're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of turkey . which is amusing , since he listed both greece and armenia there , which were both targeted by turkey . either this writing staff has no idea what they 're writing and is just happy to sell books , thinking no one will double check the info , or they 're racist and opinionated . either way , i would n't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go .
1	patriotic terrorist fighting storyline . exposes the political games played in washington , that many times put our military in dangerous situations . this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave . i know the book is fiction , but i ca n't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction . mitch rapp 's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach . she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man . again , hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations . i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it , although 95 % is absolutely wonderful and inspiring , portraying men as real men .
1	brooke dojny 's new england cookbook : 350 recipes from town and country , land and sea , hearth and home , is a stunning achievement , a magnum opus of a cookbook . published by the harvard common press , the book chronicles the cookery of new england from maine to connecticut , from the first thanksgiving to the present . dojny 's approach to the region goes well beyond new england standbys like clam chowder ( although she offers three tempting recipes ) and spans practically all the food traditions of all the ethnic groups who ever called new england home . the eight baked bean recipes in the book include one for cuban black beans and yellow rice and another for west indian peas 'n rice . new england cookery has embraced food from all over the world -- besides caribbean , you 'll find culinary influences of native american , english , portuguese , italian , irish , german scandinavian , greek , french and hungarian cooks -- and all are represented in this book . yet , for all its broadness of scope , this is a very personal book ; dojny 's voice can be heard throughout , in the headnotes , sidebars and essays that describe the people and places associated with the recipes . the book is also a wealth of new england food history and lore , as well as tips on cooking techniques and ingredients . bravo ! ( excerpted from the culinary connection , the newsletter of the connecticut women 's culinary alliance
1	i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the `` old edition '' , but judging by `` look inside this book '' , this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old . incidentally , the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware , apparently his taken orthodox name , while timothy ware is his original , given name . in sweden , the swedish translation of `` the orthodox church '' is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church . apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history . it also contains chapters on theology and worship . in my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history . its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire , under islam , and in russia both before and during communism . of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split , usually dated to 1054 . the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . however , the book must also be read with some reservations . the author is , after all , an orthodox christian himself . its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . for instance , ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . at other times , he is surprisingly `` liberal '' for an orthodox . for instance , he paints mehmet fatih , the muslim conqueror of constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian . even so , `` the orthodox church '' remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church .
0	surely there 's more to chinese youth culture than descriptions of affairs with tall western men . being a fan of pearl buck 's books on china , i was looking for more contemporary accounts of chinese culture . but this book was so dissapointing.a `` goodlooking '' shangaiese woman gives vacuous details of her affair with a tall german man . while her doped impotent chinese boyfriend simple wastes away ( why was he even in the story ? ) the writing is totaly lacking in any kind of talent . `` i was willing to assume her glow was due to her romance than her shiseido face cream ... '' . need i say more ? if you want to read an account of a totally self absorbed woman infatuted with caucasian men , indulging in meaningless affairs , which probably boosts her self esteem , read this . but there 's nothing worthy about china or chinese culture in this .
0	i am absolutely furious about this book . i quit reading about half-way through . i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life ( chapter 13 ) . in that chapter , i found three mistakes - not minor details , but major , provable points , including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs . if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs , how can i trust the rest of the information in the book ? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	another hyprocritical nut . these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus , while cutting your throats , not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists . the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks , killing native americans , and showing their christian love for the jews- by exterminating them . hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia . this is what these whackos envision
0	if you liked whyte 's previous sophomoric efforts , you 'll love this . in addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler : in no real way does the story get advanced . arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy . there are adventures , but nothing important happens . as usual , in whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters . with all the ( totally ahistorical ) democratic rhetoric , merlin 's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot . anyone who would read this , i guess , has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and does n't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence , caricatures who never grow or change , and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship . so go for it . but please , if you want something exciting that will also make you think , look at the really good arthurian efforts out there -- gillian brandshaw , a.a. attanasio , or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few..
1	i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought , and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me . i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym . nothing could have been more appropriate . it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint . it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments . each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite-sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter . i could n't be more pleased with this intro to philosophy
0	some photographers think what 's erotic is what 's hidden and left to the imagination . two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing , leaving plenty to the imagination . think of playboy magazine in the 1950 's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today . many of these are stylistic , but not very erotic . one in three of the photos in the book are erotic , not afraid of nudity . do n't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism . instead get `` shaven angels '' , `` natural beauties '' , `` 100 naked girls '' , or `` crazy , sexy girls '' .
1	i 'm a big koontz fan and as is generally the case , i greatly enjoyed this story . it was a little strange but that 's to be expected from this author and genre . that said , it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book . it had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not , in my opionion , as well-connected as in many of koontz 's other books . in addition , the ending seemed a little hasty . thus i gave it four rather than five stars . that said , i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author 's work
1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival . the author obviously knows his stuff . what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published . i 'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j.l . bourne a deal . he 's good
0	i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller . goes to show you some people have really bad taste . the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog . it seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition , entire scenes which added nothing to the story , etc . i would never purchase another book by this author . glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can ... charli
0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is ; an endorsement of ethnic cleansing . if the tables were turned and a jew , or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism , or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage , or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !
0	this is basically a commercial pitch for dr. murad 's spas and products . unless you are planning on buying his regime , he gives very , very scant information about how you could accomplish the program using other , less expensive products . do n't expect an easy how-to giving you day by day advice of supplements and skin care . it 's not here . i decided to buy this based on other 's good reviews . now i 'm thinking that they were written by employees . i was very disappointed
0	this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet . i 'm sorry i bought it . it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance , and dangerously little about c++ programming . duffy 's review correctly describes the main flaws . i would add that ( 1 ) the book is not structured to build upon oo , gof patterns , or stl design principles ; ( 2 ) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions ; ( 3 ) the images ( screenshots ) are agonizingly unreadable ; ( 4 ) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [ is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $ 100 book ? ? ? ] ; ( 5 ) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book . some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers . for example , pg 19 data types section : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million , for example , `` int i = 2000000 ; . '' long - same as int . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- wrong , professor ! this is not only a syntactically incorrect example , but a just plain wrong assertion . if the reader does not know how to determine the ( platform-specific ) size of an `` int '' or `` long '' , then the author has only served to confuse the matter further ! furthermore , i consider it a `` cheapskate '' tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form ( particularly when the book 's code listings are so sloppy ) . that said , i would not use the code , even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with ... have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring ? the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs , who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations ( futures , forwards , etc ) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
0	i have never been a fan of danielle steel 's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime , and those many years ago . i 'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors -- extreme boredom ? insanity ? -- but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer 's work . actually , i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was . the writing was completely repetitive and superficial , and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself . it read like a poor book report : `` ... and then he did this , and then he did this , and after that he did this , and then he laughed . '' we are told that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic , a little neurotic , and fairly immature despite their ( middle ) age , but not necessarily toxic -- are decent , likable guys , but we never really see too much proof of that . when the `` proof '' does come , it 's so ham-handed as to be laughable : charlie 's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother , and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character . yeahsurerightwhatever . most of the story is told through narration , with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue . the author adopted a third-person point of view , but there 's certainly nothing omniscient about it , and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters . throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls , and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable . this is how men behave and relate to one another ? i find that hard to believe , considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other . i liked the female characters of the book initially . they all seemed to be strong , capable , independent and emotionally healthy women . but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book , as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man . and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous : mountains out of molehills . for instance , gray , the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family , refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he 's been with for several months and whom he claims to love . nevermind the fact that he 's known about the adult children since the very beginning . nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy , while gray and sylvia are new yorkers . nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent , self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits . evidently gray ca n't see beyond the fact that they are `` kids '' and therefore `` family '' and therefore not to be tolerated . sorry , but whatever sympathy i 'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity . dump the weenie , sylvia . you can do better . the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness , and of course everything was wrapped up magically , with sudden capitulation , as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses . considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters , their conflicts and resolution , i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book . and why i bothered reading i
1	a very good , very quick military history overview - hits all the main points without belaboring any , gives the reader a good list of authors to look at after finishing howard
1	in all the talk about education issues these days , it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship , the energy , between students and teacher . when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids -- that 's where it 's at . it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum -- it 's what happens between people in a classroom . this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager , active kids and a caring , active teacher . it 's not all pleasant , and successes are sometimes small , but a pervasive caring underlies it all . as a teacher , this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork , go for a walk , go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day
1	as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts crafts style , i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture 's history and design evolution . with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text , this book illustrates the origins of arts crafts furniture in england and its progression , first to our east coast , and eventually westward across america . in fact , my only 'complaint ' about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more . because of the depth of information presented here , i would not say that this is a general interest read - rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts crafts movement and its recent revival .
0	i seem to be in the minority , but i did not enjoy this book at all . the main character is , of course , the `` only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf '' but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness . i felt the plot got swallowed up by the author 's need to self-insert and 'play ' in her world , and the only reason i finished this book was that i was on a plane and had nothing else to do . the plot fishtails several times , and is n't all that interesting to start with . in short , i was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general , and will likely skip her books in the future
0	i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a first person shooter ! ? i mean , they 're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see ! how hard is that ! ? halo is an awesome game but it 's really not hard to figure out what to do ! i mean you 'd have to be a complete moron not to know what to do or where to go . it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop , tellin ' ya what to do . but anyway i 'm done ranting at you wusses
1	one good knight ( 2006 ) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series , following the fairy godmother . in the previous volume , alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician . after the death of the katschei , alexander and elena were wedded , becoming godmother and consort . then an order of champions was established at glass mountain , with alexander as their master , and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms . in this novel , princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old , but is still considered a child by her mother , queen cassiopeia , and chief advisor solon adacritus . she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor . after that , her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing , appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry , and assigns a steward to handle her affairs . andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother . she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms . her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard . she reports this matter to her mother . afterward , andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature . as it comes toward her , she recognizes that it is a dragon . then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon . it flames some high architectural features , grabs a couple of animals and flies away . the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen 's advisors is very lively . andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens . the ensuing discussion is even livelier , mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices . queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery . after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down , a lottery is organized . some women find ways to disqualify themselves , but others are taken by the dragon . rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice . but then andromeda is selected . this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms . andromeda 's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest . the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon , but the good knight does n't come forward as expected . someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors . however , andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site . andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance . they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown , stopping for supplies here and there , and finally enter the wyrding lands . they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother . then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems . andromeda is nineteen and naive . then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues : does her mother love her . while many events occur in this plot , this one issue is the crux of the story . even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern . highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure , betrayal and romance . -arthur w. jordi
0	i respect the message of `` the unexpected legacy of divorce '' but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce `` unexpected . '' those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's , whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward , kids will suffer . i do n't like 'studies ' like this , they 're misleading and potentially damaging .
1	americans who ca n't name five poets will name allen ginsberg . in this case , that is good since he was one of america 's greatest poets . this book attest to this . i write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint . for the next edition , i would like to see , at least in limited edition , a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow . ginsbergs deserves better treatment
0	i picked up the audio book from the library , and did n't know by the title and author 's name ( my first jance book ) that this was chick lit . i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known . it started real well , and ms. jance knows how to reel you in with her writing . midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor , and then about her friend who died of als , and then came the long responses to the blogs . it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama .
1	having attended the fictitious `` grove school '' bingham describes in this book , i am confident in saying that it is all true . we are all indeed messed up and destined for the ivy league . in any event , the fictitious `` fairfield academy '' does also exist . i frequent the grove house of pizza and i highly recommend the chicken cutlet sub . bingham has written a fine text and i only wish he were alive to read these reviews now . hip hip hooray

1	beautiful , stunning absolutely gorgeous . a quick note to fellow brits , this was ordered on october 22nd and arrived on november 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the uk ! ! i 've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post ! !
1	good basic book , bringing back points i had been taught , and a few new to me . price most reasonable .
0	when i found `` hour game '' in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale , i thought i had hit pay dirt . but i can not believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as `` the winner '' and `` absolute power '' could turn out such a dog . long , boring , and confusing . i fear that mr. baldacci hired an `` aspiring young writer '' to `` help '' him crank out a quick book . i can not pass this book along to my friends -- i could n't do that to them . it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin . what a waste . what a shame .
1	this book opens our eyes . sure , we feel that we know what we should be doing . many times we are right in our hunches . yet , we still do not always do what needs to be done . instead , out of either laziness or taking the easy road , we fail because it is so easy to do so . besides , the customer will always walk in the door . right ? as this book reminds us , the customer may never be back . it is in the insight of a professioanl like tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know . again , our implementation of these rules which he explains simply , we will achieve . another book i encourage is `` cars and people : how to put the two together . ''
0	this book contains reproducible mini-books , bingo cards , flash cards , some word search puzzles and fill-in activities . in my opinion , the fill-ins are a bit too challenging . i even had trouble with them . the only thing in this book really `` worth it '' that i could n't make as well myself , are the mini-books . the mini-books each contain several different sight words , so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them
0	i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes , but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far . i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter . i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture , but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the fudgy brownies . all three recipes tasted delicious , so i ca n't complain there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much , and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up . i think it 's okay for a `` base '' cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients
1	renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer robert m. place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book , the buddha tarot companion : a mandala of cards . this book affords a rich unique perspective of the tarot through the lens of the buddhist paradigm . the companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand , a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions , `` embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols . '' other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the buddha cards include : `` smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading . '' and `` store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy , promote healing , or provide protective energy . '' also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards . both items are published by llewellyn , who as always , have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented . robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards . he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment . each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic 's journey to enlightenment . in fact , it is mr. place 's belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha , and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey . he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another . instead , `` the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies . '' as well , the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages . `` the european christians were enamored with the story , and they transformed him into a christian saint - st . josaphat . '' i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards . each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha 's personal journey to become the enlightened one , the buddha . robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs . he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life . i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow , the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to `` read '' using a buddhist world view .
0	is the main goal of every male evo-psy writer to attack feminism ? here 's an experiment for you : juxtapose the ideas in this book and , say , pinker 's blank slate with those of , i do n't know , any two female evo-psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages . it 's f % ing comical . but guess what ? the females ' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males ' are a lot of wishful thinking . hmmm ... .aging , successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging , successful males are made for each other . that men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s @ % , and to fawn over repressed , chastity obsessed airheads . whatever

1	if you love ludlum 's over-the-top novels ( and i do ) , the matarese circle has to be up there with the best . not all of ludlum 's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated `` oh my god ! '' declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on are n't as riveting as they could be ( the two bourne sequels suffer from this problem , i think . ) but circle delivers on all fronts . part one is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between talienkov and scofield plays out thrillingly . and these are two of ludlum 's most believably drawn characters ; we feel empathy for both , and root for them to join forces from the get-go . antonia gravet , the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in part two , brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot . one final bonus : some of ludlum 's zestiest minor characters appear in this book , adding to the fun in nearly every chapter .
0	the author really just could not hook me . a lot about food but not sure what else
0	the author has her narrator ( `` cinnamon '' ) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett , in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship . even though she 's calling the shots , as it 's her book , scarlett still comes out miles ahead . perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society , but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies , such as `` ivanhoe '' presents.the story may have been one-sided , but it 's the side mm chose to tell , and there 's kernel of truth in the `` myth '' of the old south , as in all myths . margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called `` parody '' , which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious , in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal , that epitome of heroines-katie scarlett o'hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes.as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with scarlett.that 's why he turned to women like belle watling.and to imagine mammy killing the male babies , when she had been devoted to ellen o'hara from ellen 's childhood.thank goodness this book is n't a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw , because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.gwtw will still be read and loved for all time , like the classic it is , when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.i did n't even pay that , thank goodness-the woman gave it to me , and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.i 'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.ludicrous and laughable-try again , ms randall , and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co. again , margaret mitchell need not fear , lol
0	i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i could n't wait to begin this one . the `` hero '' is a junior varsity tom joad but , ok , i was game . the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable `` baddies '' and `` goodies '' . they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on . then when we got to the jersey shore , i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it 's life against fascism , and losing , our hero knew why . all the servicemen were bullies ( a drafted station employee ) or morons ( the coast guard beach patrol ) . the 4f `` hero '' was the real mccoy however . although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury had n't kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade . he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems ; the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi-ussr pact probably and i say probably , did n't elude our observant literary genius . he was also a 1975 era feminist ; all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support . most big businessmen , probably wearing spats and silk high hats , were the bad guys needless to say . i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book . i could n't finish it and it 's a point of honor for me to finish all books . then in the bio it all became clear . the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado . i 'm still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated , quaker schoolmarm expression that said `` somebody , somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now ! ! ! '' anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease
1	seventeen-year-old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things : dancing , dressing , and reading sensational novels . but doing these things wo n't get you a husband , or acquaint you with other young ladies , such as yourself . so , upon request from a neighbor , catherine is invited to spend some time in bath - a fashionable town , where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature , who are not related to her . and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family . quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe , catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious , yet conniving family . and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney , along with his charming sister , eleanor , and whisked off to their ancestral home , known only as northanger abbey . there , catherine 's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories , that is - comes back to haunt her ; for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking , and frightening winds , that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself . the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors , and a curious history only heightens young catherine 's suspicions , and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey , and the tilney family , in general . jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young , but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore , and decided to purchase it . i will admit that , hands down , this has become one of my favorite austen books . catherine is an enchanting character , whose innocence , and naivete make her charming from beginning to end ; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers . catherine 's interactions with isabella thorpe , and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid , and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters ; while the charming henry tilney - like mr. darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman , and our young heroine . a wonderful , satirical piece of fiction , that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan . erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape
1	there are many gorgeous photos of both the insides and outsides of public and personal spaces . i was actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into . if you enjoy interior design , of just about any style , you will find it here . i love all the personal libraries shown , crammed with books and interesting objects . loved the mannequins , esp the life-sized guy sitting on the couch . i am a fan of exotic , eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with the book
0	amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization , the corporation , look moral . only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon . how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon . the us apparently is willing to finance the group , but the us also financed sadam , noriega , ... unfortunately , in this sense it is too much like real american policy , which absolutely disgusts me ( the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind , as long as they are not righteous americans ) . the characters are clichï¿½ , there is no suspense since everything goes as planned , and anyone in the crew can just about do anything , including being a successful rock band . it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk 's morality
0	i have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide , but ... it is good for re-charging my batteries when i have to write a review and feel uninspired . after reading through some ideas in this guide , i usually find i can then find my own words to say what i need to convey . the fact that all the phrases are positive , i see as a good thing because i feel it 's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you 're reviewing . if there are challenges in the persons performance , the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period . i would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing ... rather than use the phrases in the book . the people we manage deserve more than `` copy/paste '' reviews .
0	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant , but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me . except for picard , who we of course know quite well from the series , the other characters were flat and uninteresting . we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week , boring . the whole `` adversarial '' situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong , and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard

0	when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith , i ordered it the same day . after all , we seemed to be following the same path . i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts ' in the area of gene cloning . then i found christ as a 40-year-old . my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian . hearing about dr. collins ' spiritual walk had me intrigued . his book should be entitled `` a politician presents evidence for belief '' . it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research . the human genome project is elevated to status of `` bridge to a momentous new era '' . hogwash . hype is the term i would use . the dept . of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources . the author could n't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna ' than previously thought . dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma . this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school . this is not entirely his fault , however , since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution is n't perfectly gradual and perfectly random . their motivation should be perfectly obvious , but it 's not even on dr. collins ' radar . he also uses mendel 's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics , assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel 's data was `dry-labbed ' . usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology . dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology : st. augustine and c.s . lewis . i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a `` lyrical and allegorical flavor '' . i would include the book of jonah in that category as well . however , there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked . the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything , it is to refute edward o wilson , richard dawkins , and their minions . even then , he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism . francis collins is the consummate politician -- he takes a stand without offending anyone . dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician , and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time . take this quote from mat 23:14 `` woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation . '' dr. collins ' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists . in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth .
0	i tried , i really did , but i could n't get beyond 100 pages . i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one , almost as if she were forced to do so . it contained none of her usual style . the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters . i 'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style .
1	this is an enlightening , meticulous story of william `` boss '' tweed and , as past of the context , his three key cronies in the ring : peter sweeny , richard connolly and oakley hall . it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page . oh how the mighty have fallen ! the time of power ( terror ? ) for tweed 's edition of tammany hall was relatively short , but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed 's demise , another eithy-five years . the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city , putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves . the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves , primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build . a disgruntled 'whistleblower ' ( the term had no meaning back then ) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud . there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times ' hands , but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the `` ring '' could be , how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe , cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings . people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people 's friend -- the government -- can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution . the cast of characters , sinners , ( few ) saints , and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task . thomas nast , a pivotal character if not the hero of the book , provides some vivid , visual signposts . nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers ' , he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today 's politicians . nast 's giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story . it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail . a few maps , perhaps some old drawings , and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast . there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context . any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed 's nefarious deeds and nast 's colorful cartoons . ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing , filling in the gaps , and bringing now faded , black-and-white characters back to life

0	`` the number '' poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers . a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives ' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom , even if it is a number . eisenberg 's number is the inverse of that draw down , or twenty-five times ... . well , there 's the rub , twenty-five times what ? income ? expenses ? income less savings ? projected discretionary spending ? post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses ? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants , experts , philosophers , and casual acquaintances . eisenberg , a former esquire editor and short-timer with lands end , ruminates about a simple question : how much money do you need to feel secure ? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms : happiness , comfort , excess consumption , ego . and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be . constructing a one-year budget is hard enough . constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible . eisenberg does n't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses . doctors , divorcees , `downshifters ' , and very little real data shed little light on the real issues . maybe i knew too much going in . maybe i expected too much from a few positive references from other sources . in the middle i was confused . by the end i was simply disappointed . and i have my own number , and it changes every day
0	herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies : did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not ? the trial against paul merker in the east , which had as its background east germany 's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews , serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr . but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance . moreover , they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust , a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia .

1	published in 1986 , dr. deming `` out of the crisis '' seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in american management mentality . two main subjects are discussed in the book . the first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations , the second , relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way american management operates . 14 core points are suggested by dr. deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods . throughout the book , dr. deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the american industry , and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership . at times , the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow , but overall , dr. deming 's concepts are transferred to the reader . dr. deming 's `` out of the crisis '' helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one .

1	spend big bucks and hire the boston consulting group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get ? hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by bcg clients . as a result , i think this book will be most appealing to mbas thinking about working for bcg and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like . for those who are well read in business strategy , this book will be a disappointment . it focuses on very little you have n't read or thought about many times before . skip this book if you are in this category . the strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources ( frito-lay versus eagle snacks ) , adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of ( more variety and better delivery from wausau papers ) , threatening competitors ' sources of profits ( japanese auto makers go after the big 3 's positions in minivans and suvs in north america ) , copy and improve on better business models ( batesville casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques ) , encourage your competitor to retreat ( attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up ) , refocus your business model on one set of advantages ( carmax ) , acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable ( masonite international ) , and change the nature of competition ( get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors , secure low-cost assets sooner and play the wal-mart card carefully ) . the overall metaphor for the book has its problems . if you play to win , you are playing hardball . al dunlap ( author of mean business ) was a hardball guy , but it did n't pay off at sunbeam . if i read past the words in the book , the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages . `` keep 'em down '' would have been a more accurate title for the book . you will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies , new forms of technology and new business paradigms . this book is about `` rock 'em , sock 'em '' competition among the industrial giants of the world . i worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at bcg in the early 1970s , and i was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then . i do think hardball better captures the classic bcg approach used in the early 1970s than any other book i have read published by the firm or its professional staff . bruce henderson would be proud of you ! from my perspective , i graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies ( the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with `` signaling '' is pretty risk-free ) , misstating some of the cases ( did gm really crush ford 's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing ? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me ) , and praising more than was due in some cases ( the japanese car companies were very late to come into north america with minivans and suvs ) . i also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it .

1	as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic , i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q . the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos . of course the little details are fun , using terms like `` manilowesque '' `` huey-lewis shuffle '' `` prissy sonata '' and `` funky a** groove '' to describe some of the songs . fun fun fu
0	though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one , the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs . at one point , the author actually defends episiotomies ... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her , and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth . it was both infuriating and saddening . if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little , this is cute . if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth , this is not for you !
0	a 600+ pages tour of flash mx buttons and menus ... with just a couple ridiculously elementary `` tutorials '' thrown in . makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works . you wo n't find anything useful in here , that is about creating something with flash . as for me i am never gon na buy a book from this author again , and i am probably also ditching the whole `` savvy '' line as well .
0	man , oh man , i think this is one of the worst books i 've ever read . if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars , i would ! seriously , half way through , i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was . boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive ! i found the book bizarre , unfocused and poorly written . the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused . the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation . the physics , engineering , psychology , medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic . characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome , only to have them dissipate . and so on . the characters do n't even seem like real people . for example , the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain , and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are . how could someone know a person that well , but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood ? or : one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them . c'mon , if the guys a nut ( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck ' to them is nuts ! ) , write him as a nut the whole way through , do n't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book 's climax ! the book 's title is n't even explained , for crying out loud . thanatos means death in greek , i believe , but i could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying . i wo n't read this one again , nor will i look for anything else by percy walker .
0	the stationery is cute and colorful , but the pages are very cluttered . while the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels , the pages are too colorful and bold . a ballpoint or ink pen does n't look good on the paper .
1	wonderful text . helps to rationalize and boost understanding on why cubans living in miami have such foreign behaviors in the eyes of the outsider . the author takes you by the hand , and walks you step by step . absolutely wonderful and did an excellent job at steering clear of any bias
1	great book ... .my partners therapist recommended it for him to read it helps you to understand deal with the problems easy to read understand
0	was not impressed . narrow scoped , personal reflections , applications limited . i also read the male companion book wild at heart and was also not impressed
1	unlike most dystopian novels , which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future , `` a clockwork orange '' focuses on the nature of the individual in the future . our protagonist is alex , only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal , roving the streets with his band of friends , taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him . the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless . in fact , the more helpless the victim , it seems , the more pleasure the boys take in the act . the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes . they are n't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets ; in fact , it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim . they are creating mayhem just because it 's fun for them . everything changes , however , when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder . there , though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior , we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality . then , after two years , he is chosen for a new , experimental rehabilitation program , designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in , or even contemplate , any acts of violence . as we see , however , this `` treatment '' also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not . he has to be good because he is programmed to be . this , of course , raises the question central to the book : does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice ? the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first , predominantly because of burgess 's unique style . the story is narrated by alex and thus , is written in the complex slang language , invented by burgess for this book , that the youth of this society engage in . for example , a sentence taken from the opening chapter : `` he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that '' ( pg . 5 ) . there is no glossary , but if you stick with it , you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters . however , if you find yourself having difficulty , a nice , comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for `` english to nadsat '' ( due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link ) . unfortunately , it is alphabetized by the english equivalents , not by the slang terms , so looking up a word can be a little difficult . one final note of interest : the original british publication of `` a clockwork orange '' had 21 chapters , as does the current american edition . however , when the book was first published in the united states , the last chapter was dropped . as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version , publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout . whether it is or is n't is up to you to decide , but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book . without the final part of the story in place , the book offers a bleak message , implying that human nature can not really change . on the other hand , reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope . beyond that , burgess tells us in his introduction , interpretation is up to you
0	wow ! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book . luckily , i got it out of the library did n't buy it . i liked it at first , but then the situations got more more implausible . then i was reading it just to laugh at it . some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too . if i had the book here at work with me , maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes . not a well written book at all in my humble opinion . glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway
0	i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts , but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust . almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments . as i was flipping through the book , i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book . i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore , and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
1	i purchased the book with the intention of teaching myself all the core material in it . the material offers readers a limited number of examples per chapter per section . while these examples may sometimes make you wish for added detail , ultimately there is enough explanation to pull the reader through . be sure you understand the previous chapter before moving onto the next or you will most likely get lost . in the end i was very satisfied with my order . listen to me ... if your at least decent in math you 'll do just fine following this algebra 2 textbook
0	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer , this book will provide lots of information . it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog . but for my taste , i found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing , too much portraiture lighting , not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is
1	this book is important for every one who has a back `` issue '' . given 5 as gifts to loved one 's experiencing back pain
1	rolling stone has long been the `` gold standard '' for rock journalism . any history of rock and roll that does n't have billy joel or bob seger is all right by me . i need to update my copy right away ! great job , as usual , rolling stone ! ! ! !
0	i 'd never read berry before , but as far as i can tell , this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory . however , it 's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm . there are two related problems with the book : one of presentation , and one of tone . the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there 's no room for specifics . so , while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry 's vision , there 's no detail to back it all up . the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at . of course , some of the pieces are lectures , but there 's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book . it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of `` appropriate '' , `` authentic '' and `` adequate '' . when these are used ( as they often are ) , there he 's obviously made some kind of value judgment , but the reader is never let in on it . the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir . which is unfortunate , since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things ( though not his anti-abortion stance ) . small farms are good , agribusiness is bad , stewardship of the land is good , extraction industries are bad , treating the body as an organic whole is good , and things of that nature . alas , he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful . two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate : `` this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed . '' and `` communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people , country life , and country places . '' berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses . for example , in one essay , he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine , untouched state , and that 's all . while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way , they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry 's views on stewardship and land use . it certainly does n't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses . his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition . however , it ignores the fact that , historically , small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins , was subject to all kind of external instability ( weather , vermin , etc . ) , and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level . in farming , cash is scarce , that 's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself , such as in wwii , when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california . ( of course , in berry 's vision , you do n't really need cash , because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors . ) berry 's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff , and even in cities people are creating this . the growth of csas , farmers markets , and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this . however , to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection
1	this book was amazing ! i 'm giving it to my dad for helping me through college ! great gift for parents and children !
1	i have read this book daily for almost 20 years . the original book , given to me in 1979 is somewhat worn and now i require a replacement . it has been and will remain my first reading each day
1	dr. temperance brennan , a forensic anthropologist , is called upon to aid in the investigation of a commercial jet crash in the mountains of north carolina . andrew ryan , a colleague and romantic possible , turns up on site also when his partner in the quebec police is listed on the flight manifest . when temperance discovers a foot that does not seem to come from the disaster site , things begin to get dangerous for her and those around her . it becomes a clue in a deadly mystery involving many highly placed individuals who want their secret to remain just that , a secret . temperance and ryan spark reactions from each other , the question is , will it ignite or just smolder ? ? this novel is full of forensic science and detail that open the door to a fascinating yet gruesome world . kathy reichs has an afterword page in which she talks about 9/11 and the real disaster site in nyc where she aided in determining the identities of victims from the twin towers , serving on the government disaster response team , much like temperance in this novel ... ... .although she says the horror and emotional impact was more than she could have imagined . the novel was written and published 2 months before the real disaster occurred
1	these are true tales from a clinical neurologist 's notebook , but this is n't just any neurologist . oliver sacks , author of the justly celebrated , the man who mistook his wife for a hat ( 1986 ) and awakenings ( 1973 ) , which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams , and other works , is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity . he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating , yet studiously objective , a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations , historical comparisons and wisdom . part of the power of these tales , and of all of sacks 's work , is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality . this makes for a compelling read . if you 've never read sacks before , you are in for a very special treat . these tales are paradoxical because `` defects , disorders , diseases '' can bring out `` latent powers , developments , evolutions , forms of life , that might never be seen or even be imaginable , in their absence . '' it is this `` 'creative ' potential , that forms the central theme of this book '' ( from sacks 's preface , page xvi ) . the first tale , `` the case of the colorblind painter '' is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five , and the effect this had on his life and work . the second , `` the last hippie '' is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties . sacks tells this sad , pathetic story with vivid detail , and characteristically ends it with a footnote , a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears . ( do n't skip the footnotes ! ) the third tale , `` a surgeon 's life , '' is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette 's syndrome . it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination . dr. carl bennett , riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder , compulsions that cause him to throw things , to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner , to flail , jump and jerk about , nonetheless became a very successful ( and beloved ) doctor of surgery . sacks scrubs up with dr. bennett and goes into surgery with him , during which , miraculously , the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery . sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children , sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls , and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be . the fourth tale , `` to see and not see , '' is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing . this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain . this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination . in the fifth tale , `` the landscape of his dreams , we meet a gifted artist , franco magnani , who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito , italy through his paintings . he has a nearly photographic , three-dimensional memory , but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one , he cares only to re-create his pontito , not the people or events , but the houses , the masonry , the stones , and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail . the chapter `` prodigies , '' focuses on an autistic artist , stephen wiltshire , whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand . in this tale , and the concluding tale , `` an anthropologist on mars , '' sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it ( at least in my interpretation ) as an alternate view of reality , a view with its own strengths and weaknesses , a world that is just as true and valid as the `` normal '' one . of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme , and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society . yet , perhaps that is society 's loss . i even got the sense , in reading these concluding stories about autism , that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary `` strategy '' trying to emerge , that is , a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work . i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic , with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration , are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness , and that humankind is the better for it . incidentally , the last tale about temple grandin , who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university , is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society , yet remains autistic . she is the one who says she sometimes feels , because of her different perspective , like `` an anthropologist on mars '' when she views `` normal '' people . sacks allows us to see why . bottom line : this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition , written with grace and a deep sense of humanity , not to be missed
0	if you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest , purest , and most divine knowledge , than this is your book -- but it is n't mine . page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh ... .i kept hoping that plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing , but it did n't happen
0	the characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional , the dialog hackneyed . i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list . it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else . do n't waste your money
0	this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep , but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep . i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep , so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments . although , they were right about the obscurity , this book still taught me alot . you do n't necessarily need it , but if you want to be prepared , this book will not hurt your bank account that much . i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature ( 5 stars , check out the reviews ) , and the internet . that is all you need
1	the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons . one it is slightly cheaper than others , but most important is that it has the words'do n't panic ' written in bold letters on the cover . the story of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy revolves around this remarkable book . this story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way . the last earthman , arthur dent , is saved by his best friend ford prefect , who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of betelgeuse . they are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the heart of gold using the infinate improbability drive . inside they meet up with zaphod beeblebrox , the two headed , three armed president of the galaxy , trillian , an earthwoman who arthur failed to pick up and wnt with zaphod , and marvin , a parinoid android . this book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy . these adventures involve mice , an abandonded planet , a rather suprised sperm whale , and the number 42 . i loved this book for many reasons . one reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor . another is that it gives a good spin on life . i could always count on this book to cheer me up . do n't just stop with this book there are many others in this series .
1	this is one of nora roberts ' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite . i adore this book . the characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating . callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband . what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances ( including roberts ) . definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot . it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
1	first , the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with 'freaks ' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with 'normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants -- crucial to the plot of the novel -- seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say `` gosh ! '' ) . this did detract from the impact of the death , unfortunately , but i still very strongly recommend this book . five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !
1	tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls ; states v. markets v. individuals ; and the comprehensive failure of the arab street , leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out . from reading this compilation of nyt columns , i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book , 'the world is flat . ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions , his ability to see the big picture is spot on
1	what a great book . i have been turned off to religion due to the negativeness that surrounds it . watching joel osteen on tv and reading this book makes me love god even more . when i think back on my life , i have truly had many blessings and i no longer need to feel guilty for accepting god 's blessings . god has always been about love , hope , faith and greatness . he has never been about hatred , prejudice or guilt .
1	the color tabs really help you know what section to look at . the only disadvantages of this field guide are that it does n't document every species in north america and that the new national geographic field guide to the birds of north america , fifth edition has the blue grouse split into the sooty and dusky grouse making it more up to date ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! still , this field guide has many good things .
0	this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework . writing a book is no small feat , and technical books are a special beast . with that last statement in mind , this is were the book sadly falls short . for one , the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books ' code . the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print . while improvement is always good , this presents two problems . 1 . the sample application is now out of sync with the material . not a good thing for those trying to learn , as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book . also , and this is not to disparage the authors skill , but i buy books because i am expecting experienced , if not expert advice . if a small , sample application needs rewriting , perhaps they should write about something else ? further down this road , the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling . i suspect that the final build file was not tested , or it was a case of `` well , it compiles on my machine '' . there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled . thankfully , i use eclipse and imported the project . eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies , which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive . examples are : jakarta-commons/collections , and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access . for an experienced developer , familiar with ant and a good ide , it was not a lot of trouble to get it running , it just did not give me a good impression . bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql : first , no matter what db you swap in , you 'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file . i made property variables which i placed in build.properties . then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it . ) . another great reason to use eclipse . why you must change it , is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you ca n't name a table user
0	other reviewers have taken pains to outline the `` plot '' of this baby boomer bodice ripper . suffice it to say author kathryn harrison , scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that `` more is better '' , offers estrangement between identical twins , loss of a child , incest , paternity confusion , mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink . this reader was aching for the hero , will , to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like `` it 's just ... it 's ... what is it ? will does n't have a word for what he feels . '' ( perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader : the author , however , should not . in any case , those are lousy , lazy sentences among so many examples . ) in addition to being insufferably , cartoonishly silly , the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure . bad things happen to will-the-shrink , will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink , then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened , what he thinks happened , and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks . as for ms harrsion 's `` famous '' sex scenes . they practically lie on their backs , fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval : `` she 's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly , almost unnaturally , slippery . '' `` envy '' , by the way , is ms harrison 's 11th book and she should , by now , be getting things more right than wrong
0	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned , ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins ( some explicit `` parts '' i didn`t like at all ) .simply not the danielle steel we like . the story itselfs is ok ( gives the readers some `` insights '' behind the scenes of hollywood ) but ... . some of her books i`ve read over and over again . i am not going to touch secrets for a second time , however
0	do you feel different from people around you ? do they resent your ingenuity ? have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs ? do you long for the company of others like yourself , who , tragically but inevitably , are biologically destined to wipe these shorter , darker subhumans from the face of the earth ? congratulations ! you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club , possibly both ! ( i exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia , or a boer in south africa , or maybe you just like larry niven , but that 's beside the point ) i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book . in the late 1970 's when she did her research , we did n't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals , and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia . ultimately we 'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like , and auel 's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion . similarly , her bloated , almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author , though one wonders what parasite infected her editor . i have n't read her more recent works , but i imagine she has probably improved . even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable . what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story , nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged . the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky 's secret doctrine on the fall of the `` aryans '' - who interbred with `` subhumans '' introducing the world to , oh i dunno , domination by the unworthy , blind tradition , suppression of the individual , all the hallmarks of the book 's neanderthal culture . of course , even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent , overpowered by a brutish thug . against this master narrative , all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression . i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet , and give auel 's books a wide berth . also ? enough rape scenes already
0	although a majority of readers obviously loves this book , i have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me . our only daughter left for college this year , but fortunately i have trained her in time to be independent . if your kid does n't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you 're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives , this book is right for you . not in my dreams would i have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself ! i do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency ! i expected different things from this book , on a deeper psychological level
1	ironweed by william j. kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i 've recently joined . the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie ( at the group meeting ) that was based on the novel . as i expected , the movie paled in comparison to the book , despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself . jack nicholson plays the main character ( francis ) and meryl streep is his `` wan na be '' socialite girlfriend ( helen ) , but this star power does n't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel . set during the `` great depression , '' ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society : drunks , homeless , impoverished , and in that regard the story is timeless . i enjoyed the characters ' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots , but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption , forgiveness , and love . the love aspect may be hard to spot , but it is there , unconventionally , in many of the character 's interactions . this favorable recommendation comes with a warning : it can be a depressing read , definitely not a happy one , and while i found it inspirational , it will not conjure any blithe emotions . ironweed is definitely not a june beach read , being more apropos to a long winter night , indoor , by a warm fire .
1	the emotionally unavailable man should be added to everyone 's self-help library . ms. henry clearly identifies and defines the problem , then prescribles manageable steps for healing . her energetic writing style involves the reader right from the start . even those who do not suffer from emotional detachment will find this book engaging . most may even identify loved ones who either exhibit this or who are involved with someone who exhibits this behavior . clearly this is a book for our times .
0	i did n't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived . having now wasted a weekend reading this book , i have to agree with everyone . the topic sounds great , the book is n't
0	i really love to get these for my wife , surprises are best when i give them to her , and she enjoys all of them from this great author , but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series : - ( . having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds , really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great , just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others , get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up ! peace everyone : - ) jeff
1	first book i 've read from sandra brown and it was really great . it was a page turner from beginning to end . i found the book interesting and easy reading . a well written mystery suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end . will not be the last sandra brown novel for me
0	this year , 60 % of college entries will be female . look at this spring 's honor role listings . last year , 78 % of honor role members in my community were female . schools are fails boys - not girls . if you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap , then get this book . if you want to really improve the quality of education , there are thousands of reads better than this
0	this book is the same as `` teach yourself origami '' and `` origami , the art of paper-folding '' , just with another cover to make you think it is new , also in the webside they describe it as a book of david brill , it does not contain nothing of him , not even his name mention ! ? ! ? if you have no origami book , it could be good for you , other wise beware ! !
0	i am reading this for a college course called `` history of the american city '' . this book is a typical 'college texbook ' in that it is filled with numbers , dates , percentages , figures , numbers , oh did i say numbers , dates , figures , and years , oh and plenty of numbers ... the brilliant , dilligent , honored , and esteemed scolar of a woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers , facts , years , etc ... i , on the other hand , am absolutley hating it and foolishly i have allowed the drop date to pass , so i have to read the book or fail the class . i am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities , unless i am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me . needless to say , from ( attempting ) reading it i am getting a headache and do n't really even have the time to write this review . i say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose ' of numbers , names , dates , figures , facts , percentages , orders , years , dates and more numbers , dates , facts , figures ( are you getting my drift yet ? ) , it will be time well served though. -- - avoid -- - this -- - book . please -- find another book . maybe if people told the truth about this brand of writing , more professors might have to teach and people like ms. abu-lughod would n't continue to make money off of writing books such as this , and folks like her might have to write to communicate ! ! ! ! , like the rest of us.thank you for taking the time to read this . ok , i have to say it : this sucks .
0	this book , up to the very end was very good . with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half . the end is what ruins the entire thing . do n't worry i 'm not going to spoil anything . i 'll just say the ending stinks out loud ! this story is not really horror , its sifi . a adventure/drama/sifi . it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer . everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed . and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough . the writting was dead on as always and character development was good . this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book
1	this was an amazing read . i could n't put it down . if you like csi , then you will love this books . the forensics are very interesting . you would never guess who the killer is ! i was totally shocked when i got to the end
1	the penguin guide is still the best in the business . it has its biases but you ca n't beat its comprehensiveness and the reviewers wide range and love of the music are evident
1	`` when i first came to iran , black clad women all seemed the same . scary unsmiling servants of the ayatollas '' having visited the islamic republic of iran in june , i was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by elaine sciolino in her book persian mirrors . i am more than grateful for this book , which alerted me to the diversity of cultures , and the general way of life so absolutely different from the western world . elaine sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the iranians and also i am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an iranian , you have a friend for life . my most treasured memories of iran will never leave me and i thank ms sciolino for preparing me for that journey . reviewed by heather marshall negahdar ( sugar-cane 11/10/05 )
0	this is another piece of lowbrow anti-german propaganda dressed as historiography . the book is a mess of primary , yet selective and biased historical research , simplistic psycho-babble , ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation , pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least , absolutely third rate military history . the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler , that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives . all in all , cheap trash billed as history .
1	i love this book -- it 's beautiful . this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard , with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly , causing the ruckus with all the animals . the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and , therefore , may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend : the pigs in the muck , the kittens in the hayloft , the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish . but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming 's gorgeous art each time . my nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter -- this is definitely one of his favorites . i highly recommend this book
1	a surprisingly tiny book . ( the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size . ) after receiving it , i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page . it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6 . i had not noticed that before i ordered it . the book seems much smaller than that . not that that is a problem ; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box . i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you 'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever . it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading . for one thing , the pages are much too small for emergency tp use . not that i am complaining , mind you . this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from `` the amish '' to `` zero '' . ( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text , but who cares - the book is fun . ) each page has its stated `` fact '' and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject . also , there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three `` instant personalities '' each - little tidbits of info about famous people . ( although , thomas jefferson got his own page , as did alfred hitchcock . ) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently ( bla bla ) , the information here is actually correct . will and mangesh research their topics , not just publish un-provable `` facts '' gathered from the internet . use the contents with confidence .
1	i knew the government was a little crooked ... but when i read this ... .well ... lets just say i dont trust the government anymore . its a very great book , and fills you in on some information that you might have missed
1	rarely is there a book that i can not put down , this was an exception . quite a suspensfull page turner . any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that . i would have given it 5 stars , but i do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel , that 's just my taste . by far , however , one of the best books i have read in a long time
0	i only glanced through this book , yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied . i can , however , write about one of the editors , mike shaw , who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence ' when assessing us as parents . he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london , england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness ' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act . we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were `` at risk of neglect '' . mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations . yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched . under cross examination , he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations . luckily for us , he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist . i do n't know about his co-editors , but if his work is anything to go by , the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced . here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court . judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously . evidence-gathering . `` on 9.8.02 , i interviewed mr mrs orman [ 2 hours ] `` on 21.8.02 , i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [ 40 mins ] , witnessed contact [ 1 hour ] and spoke to the children without their parents [ 20 mins ] [ and ] i interviewed the foster carer [ 2 hours ] . observations . `` mr mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout. [ ... ] mr orman showed insight [ ... but ] was n't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children . the couple were very robust in refuting the [ welfare 's ] account , which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation . `` contact took place in the park [ ... ] the parents and children seemed happy to see each other ; they chatted in animated style . [ ... ] i was n't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children 's presence `` [ interviewing the children ] the children seemed attentive [ ... ] but answered `` do n't know '' , fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [ ... ] erin related [ a simpsons episode where ] homer [ ... ] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside . i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman 's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed . [ note . this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document ! ] conclusions recommendations `` [ ... ] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful . [ ... ] `` mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children . so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact . [ ... ] i think there is some insecurity in the children 's attachment to their parents . [ note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park . ] `` were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own , i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs . [ ... ] asked whether he had any regrets , mr orman did n't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care . [ ... ] erin [ who was 8 at the time ] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper , and support and advise socially . i suspect mr orman would find this difficult . `` my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness . [ ... ] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [ sic ] children . `` [ ... ] the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [ sic ] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home . `` [ ... ] returning home is likely to further retard the children 's social and emotional development . [ ... ] `` these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse . [ ... ] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause . i also find very plausible ms [ charlotte ] curran 's suggestion ( ... [ in ] her [ written ] statement ) that mr orman dominates his wife . `` the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me , but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible . [ .. ] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers . [ ... ] contact should be gradually reduced . '' mike shaw 's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities , but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation . yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed , so that the children could lead a normal and happy life . he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70 % of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents . our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt ; and the case was eventually closed . so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions
0	book goes over a lot of information in a very short time , but not much of that information is worth anything unless you 're building a circle-track or drag car . took the hit and ordered stanforth 's competition car suspension
0	this novel could not hold my interest . i am an anne perry fan , but could not get into this book . i could n't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting . i 'm really disappointed , because i was looking forward to a new series by her . joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder , yet there did n't seem to be much emotion . maybe ms. perry tried to tell too many stories within one story . in reviewing the book , it 's hard to pin point exactly why i did n't like this book . i would skip this series and read the pitt series .
1	this book is the best book about baby face nelson , i enjoyed reading this book greatly . everything you wanted to know about lester gillis is in this book . every part of his life was explained in great detail ; the authors did not leave anything out . i highly recommend this book to people who are into the depression era gangsters
0	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text -- - from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager , of a real company . it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories -- - along with trite sayings such as `` when you find a back door that 's open , close it '' or my personal favorite `` use the lanterns of your life to help light the way . '' if you 're looking for an inspirational book , one with a solid basis , forget this one . you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope
0	the joke here is that krugman is convinced he can write . he ends his little intro with the smug assertion that `` maybe economists can write after all , '' offering himself as proof . ( krugman can not write well , but he has mastered the clumsy , undistinguished style of a bad lit professor -- -the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing -- -an accomplishment he 's very proud of . to use his own favorite `` emphasizing '' gimmick : krugman stinks -- -full stop . ) the punchline is that shortly afterward , the new york times hired him . it was a match made in middlebrow heaven . ( i should add that i do like the substance of krugman 's newspaper articles , if not the style . an enemy of the current white house is a friend of mine . ) as far as the economics go , he 's pro-nafta and pro- '' free trade '' just like all establishment economists , and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets . do n't waste your time
1	i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels . this was my first sw novel . i must say i want to be a sith . i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming . if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth ! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects . i however got more excited because i played kotor/ep3 the game/kotor 2 and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games . i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in ep3 . it an amazing story and ca n't wait to a sequel if any .
1	from the introduction of basic concepts such as likelihood ratios and predictive values to the simple table format with the always beautiful netter illustrations , this is the ortho exam text to have . i just hope the next edition is being planned to keep pace with new research . thank you to joshua cleland for putting this together for us
1	when john grisham introduced us to bendini , lambert locke , a memphis tax boutique controlled by the mafia , the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious . these days no one , least of all our hero scott finn , is particularly sure that organized crime does n't just control the firm , but also the governor 's office , the us attorneys office and the boston pd . finn , who worked and fought his way out of the streets of southie to the thick-pile carpets of boston 's brahmin legal establishment , finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind . when a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate `` little jack '' who was terrorizing the city finn is drawn into the fray , where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track . finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying , though not very hard , to put him away . and a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process . if it seems over the top , it is . but it is good fun too
1	i would recomend this book to anyone , it is fantastic and funny . it made me laugh . it really took my imagination on an adventure . you really need to read this book .
1	this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns , from the get-go to contemporary times , has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters - each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride - or as a reference source . reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount , it 's instructive to read the history of grover cleveland , who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates . like clinton , he had his scandals - fathering an illegitimate child . like gore , his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost , in a hotly contested , knife-edge electoral college tally
0	tim lahaye , jerry jenkins , and others in the pre-trib circle , such as ed hindson , tommy ice , chuck missler , etc. , continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago . the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early church , and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming . these men are novices and not prophecy `` experts '' or `` scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination ; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians . why continue to be deceived ? tim cohen , in his excellent book , the antichrist and a cup of tea , provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now . not only that , the same author ( tim cohen ) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ : the real rapture . if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture ( based on a volume in his forthcoming `` messiah , history , and the tribulation period '' series ( see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items )
1	i loved this book . the food was really good and fast ( which is good because i have a very packed schedule ) . also great if you 're on a budget . the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants . the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy ( i 'm from texas , i like spicy ) , to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it . i just modified the recipes and everything was fine
0	this book was on a very interseting topic . the author took time in studying this topic . it was about the impending world oil shortage . that is the time when we , the world , will run out of oil . it tells you about hubbert 's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil . they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from . then they talk about where oil is . they also talk about drilling for oil . they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil . sometimes it will take even more time then that . then they talk about the size of oil fields . they also reexamine hubbert 's analysis later on in the book . rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future . they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases . they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have . hubbert was a brilliant man . some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he did n't want to he told everybody . the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about . i would n't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage . i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring . when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring . i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book
0	david fromkin 's `` peace to end all peace '' is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work . many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other . fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east ( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia ) was created during and after the first world war . obviously , in order to do this , the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered . this is where fromkin 's unusual methodology comes into play . focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the `` eastern question '' in their favour , the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process . admittedly , it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn , but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire ( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter ) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much . never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell . a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today , and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations . the problem that fromkin has , however , is that he does not make these very well at all . the story is told in a roughly chronological manner , which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters . ultimately , the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader , who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is . additionally , fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided . indeed , one map ( showing enver pasha 's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia ) is laughable in the extreme . the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows , and not equilateral triagles . where fromkin does well , however , is in his use of purely european sources . it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east , but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question . in terms of europe , however , his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did . ultimately , `` a peace to end all peace '' is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work . a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this , and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been ( the chapters in margaret attwood 's `` the peacemakers '' or william cleveland 's `` modern middle east '' both easily outshine this )
1	one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot 's unfurtunate preducices . but how come you do n't say something like that about o ' henry . we ca n't just stop reading authers because you we do n't like their views . someone calls hemingway looking forward ? if that 's looking forward i'de rather look backward . hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever . most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot . eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past , but towards what we have made out of the present . in name of progress , we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls . to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous , the first draft according to one of eliot 's biographers , was absolutly a expression of relavtism . one critic accused him being a nihilist . on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone , not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe . so it does n't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets . so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism , we could use more of that . yet what he does n't right he evoces through mode and tone , giving us truly one of the best poems of this , or any other century .
1	some of patterson 's conclusions were a bit of a reach . some of his segways were n't all that smooth . but this book is just plain entertaining . it is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the devil , lingering around after death , and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable . well , some of it actually believable . patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances ( in particular the rolling stones and led zeppelin ) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves .
0	this book is very disappointing , as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism . it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear , ie . bin laden and aq are everywhere , responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups ( such as ji ) are aq franchises - total bollocks . the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a `` scholar '' who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
1	although i 'm not new to wwii histories , the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne 's `` the price of glory . '' since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi 's most epic battles , i did not hesitate to read `` stalingrad : the fateful siege '' by antony beevor . in both works , comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons . both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy , the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander 's control , and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering . beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad , which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down . from the well-documented cold , lice , and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike , to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov 's trap , it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing . unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict , the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor 's work makes the reader sympathize for russians , germans , romanians , and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle . not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers , he also examines the more famous players in the battle ; including a paranoid stalin , a dreaming hitler , a finger-pointing von manstein , and a indecisive paulus . indeed , the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad . overall , `` stalingrad : the fateful siege '' is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard-hitting military history
0	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget . i was wrong . instead , it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , on all kinds of architectural extravagances . perhaps this book could have a subtitle : how to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house . if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply , this is the wrong book
0	i was at the airport , getting ready to fly out to cali and i found this book in the airport gift shop- i thought what a stroke of luck i had getting a stephen king title at such a juncture ... i 'm a huge fan . despite the fact that i started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed , i was sorely disappointed . much ado about nothing would be an overstatement
1	this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc . ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists
1	pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees , but what he thinks about . the most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image , and jerry thompson 's exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in truth and photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences
1	james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust-fund kid , inheriting millions while still in college . he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady , indiana-jones-style south american graverobber . the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth , then only a few years old . moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954 . the book never materialized , but moseley was left with extensive notes , and the indelible and accurate impression that , apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they did n't recognize , and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar , the majority of the mythmakers were , as my old grandma used to say , `` crazy as a betsy-bug . '' over the years moseley kept his hand in , meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field , other times ( more accurately ) `` ufoology .

0	ethan mordden 's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book . this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs . his political ramblings ( often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense ) seep through the book , dragging it down . the french people are slammed a number of times , along with the aclu , burt lancaster ( apparently , according to ethan a good friend of stalin ) and the left in general , while the author defends bush ( and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre ) . the author 's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target , any target . it is often hard to stomach . the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that , it can actually make one want to look at the work again . an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public . the author is capable of better work
1	first off , i want to say that i can not believe the audacity some people have in the censure and harsh remarks towards this brilliant young man ! shame on you ! the book its self is great , great use of language , story and wonderful imagination . to be so rediculous as to pull this young man up on grammatical structure and lexical syntax is rediculous ! who cares ! talk about looking for somthing to criticize , this young man brought his dream to life and became a best selling author and even the man behind a full feature major motion picture ! ! ! gee wizz , most would have difficulty reading a novel and getting off their back side to hire a dvd let alone make the whole damn thing yourself happen ! help or no help , he made it work , he is a vital part in the chain and all props to you my friend ! ! !
1	why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official ? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust , confidence and cons . though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u.s. exploded into civil war , its insights cross cultural boundaries . this is not an easy book to read for several reasons . first , it is undoubtedly one of the first `` post-modern '' novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling . ( another example : dostoevsky 's notes from the underground . ) the confidence-man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat -- beggars , absurdly dressed frontiersmen , sickly misers , shysters , patent medicine hucksters , veterans ( of the mexican-american war ) and the `` hero '' in the latter part of the book , the cosmopolitan . in typical melville fashion , you also get asides -- directly to the reader , in several cases , as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel . the lack of structure , action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book , but if you read each conversation as a separate story , then it starts to make more sense . for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme : the nature of trust and confidence . in a very sly way , melville shows how a variety of cons are worked , as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do : buy the `` herbal '' patent medicine , buy shares in a bogus stock venture , or donate cash to a suspect `` charity . '' in other chapters , it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself . since the book is mostly conversations , we are left to our own conclusions ; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending . this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust ; we do n't want to be taken , but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted . to trust no one is to be entirely isolated . melville also raises the question : is it always a bad thing to be conned ? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy , and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life . the ornery frontiersman who 's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner . is that a terrible thing , to trust despite a history of being burned ? the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored . we think the cosmopolitan is a con-man , but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum , he returns it , just to prove a point . is that a continuance of the con , or is he actually trustworthy ? the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task : sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens . in a traditional society , things operate in rote ways ; young people follow in their parents ' traditional roles , money is made and lent according to unchanging standards , and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways . but in america , none of this structure is available . even in melville 's day , america was a polyglot culture on the move ; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress , manner and speech/pitch . the con , of course , works on precisely this necessity to rely on one 's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods . so the con man dresses well and has a good story , and an answer for every doubt . the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long , leisurely , clause upon clause sentences . but the book is also peppered with his sly humor , which sneaks up on you ... well , just like a good con .
1	ted kheel has written a masterful , poignant and important book . in an increasingly litigious and contentious world , his is a voice of reason , compassion and true vision . as karl llewellyn observed , `` technique without compassion is a menace , and compassion without technique is a mess .

1	as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well , this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises . it 's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears , having first been written in 1856 . but it is practical , clear and encouraging . it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw . and by focussing on drawing with pencil , it provides the foundation for using any other media . a wonderful find
0	i had to read this book for a political theory class in college . after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader ... benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with . the book is also not organized well . in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes . points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book . benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued . throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights . to be honest , i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her . still , i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically . much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories . in short , i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure , or intellectual curiosity . if you have to read the rights of others for a class , i extend my condolences .
1	this is one of the best biographies i have ever read . you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work - it 's a true labor of love . filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes , this one is a keeper . who knew miss francis was such a `` wild child '' ? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff , lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase .
0	this book does n't make any sense . it is so , so , so b-o-r-i-n-g . the book is not well written , and the sentences are way too short . i woud n't recommand this book to anyone
1	after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know , i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself . this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry , what kind of people you 'll be dealing with , what the hiring pricess is like ( with particular emphasis on the interviews ) , and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired . i 'm very glad that i took the time to read this book because , after finishing it , i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable . obviously this is simply my own opinion , and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work , but nearly every single thing about it , from the superficial way applicants are screened , to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job , sounds simply awful to me . if you are considering a career as a drug rep , you should definitely do your homework to make sure it 's really something you would enjoy . this book may very well convince you that you would love it . if so , that 's great , and i hope you are successful . but if this kind of work is not right for you , this book can be equally helpful because you 'll find out by reading it what the job is really like . there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now , and although this one was helpful , i have to say that i think insider 's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one . if you only buy one book , definitely buy that one instead . but if you buy two books , pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice . one more thing : there 's some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report . the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants , from their shoes to their body language . he also stresses well-written resumes and cover letters . one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it . imagine my surprise , then , when on the very next page it says candidates should `` ... right a short paragraph ... '' about their job experiences . it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book
0	there was nothing in this book that our association has n't covered nearly every week . i was very dissapointed . it offered little tidbits like `` a postgame review can help you learn from experience '' . do n't we all do `` postgame reviews '' , even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home ? i certainly do . no , i 'm not he best umpire in our association . i would rate myself as somewhere in the middle . the book offered me nothing new , nothing that our association does n't talk about constantly . buy a childress , or save your money
0	tedious and inane come to mind . it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a `` catty '' pseudo-feminist style , rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the `` ignorant natives '' of egypt and inept sexual innuendo . the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced . the characters do not come across as real . very disappointing . leave this one on the library shelf
1	excellent book , if you are interest in ancient egypt , read this book , you 'll learn a lot of interesting facts about the valley of the kings , the pharaohs , etc .

0	let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy . after reading this book , i now think he is one step above slime . to be fair , some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing . he is anti-pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell , michael moore , barney frank , barbara streisand , and `` that fat girl from the dixie chicks '' , among others . no problem there in my opinion . that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book . the rest is just babble , often repeated over and over again , that even larry lovers will find annoying . a couple things that really bothered me . the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of `` retards '' and down 's syndrome children . he must use the term `` retard '' at least fifty+ times in the book . this is appreciably different than making a joke about , say , michael moore . moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes . the down 's syndrome children did not . my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on `` retards '' . he also racially sterotypes in the book . many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond . the down 's syndrome kids ca n't . larry , i can only hope god ( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book ) grants you a `` retard '' child to love and care for . then , i would like to read your next book . i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly . the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses . he plays the good 'ol bubba . he ai n't too bright and he ai n't ever changed since he left the farm . his `` celebrity '' - his word not mine - has not gone to his head . ok , larry . why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures , including serious topics such as abortion ? why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down ? why the unrelenting references to your `` celebrity '' ? the terms `` meet and greet '' and `` after-party '' were used over and over and over , as an example . do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are ? well , you are wrong . they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become . that 's hollywood-speak my country , fart loving , nose picking friend . overall , this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron ( see does n't that sound better than `` retard '' ) . my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people . those who are dumb and know they are dumb . and those who are dumb but are so dumb , they do n't realize it . the former category usually shuts up ( knowing they are dumb ) . the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter . the first group is obviously smarter than the second . larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group . the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book . make jokes , larry , and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like . unfortunately , larry ca n't see the obvious . like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book , he has become exactly one of them . a thin layer of `` good 'ol boy '' on top , covering a core of venom and `` celebrity '' . he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets . my suggestion : do n't buy larry 's act and , by all means , do n't buy the book .
1	the language , the words , the concepts , the illustrations , the points he brings out , everything in this book is beautiful . the metaphors he will use to get a certain point across , is brilliant , simple , creative , nimble ; he dances around philosophical discussion with grace . he explains relativism , and absolutism , quite well , and puts you in the crossfire , to make up your mind ; he shows you , but does n't tell you ; he offers you ; he willingly gives you ; the truth . buy this book
0	if you want to believe an illusion , go for it . some readers say he is well informed . whoa . this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so . if it makes you feel good to believe that the us is bad , the environment is collapsing , and we need socialism to survive , then this is the book for you . if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion , find another source . waste of money

1	the handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols by robert beer ( who has studied and practice tibetan thanga painting for more than thirty years ) is a straightforward reference guide to the meaningful symbolism of sacred tibetan art . black-and-white illustrations depict all the major buddhist symbols and motifs , while the text offers depth and interpretation behind the meaning and usage of each . the handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols is enthusiastically recommended for inclusion into buddhist studies and especially informative for connoisseurs of tibetan art
1	what a wonderful book . it 's too bad so many readers today know only tom wolfe , not thomas wolfe . even though it has been at least 10 years since reading look homewood angel , i knew almost immediately when i came to the new sections . they add a depth to the novel , bringing in the whole town and relatives , rather being only about eugene gant . my favorite wolfe readings involve trains ; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train , is exactly as i remember my earlier train rides.what are they doing now , that the train has passed ? other 800 page books might be dull , but not this one . having been given it as a present recently , i am very surprised and disappointed that it is already 'out of print . '' more people should know about o lost
0	i was optimistic when i saw the title , but you know that old saying , `` do n't judge a book by its cover . '' the author has a few legitimate ideas , but any google search could come up with the same information in greater depth and better accuracy . she condemns saving animals from shelters and actually encourages people to breed animals to increase the pet population . she is no more a pet lover than i am a supermodel . her ideas are based solely on money . even if it encourages starting a puppy mill ( euphemistically referred to as a dog breeder ) . early in her book she mentions the titles of a few other books she recommends ( i have chosen not to seek them out ) , but she says do n't spend your money on them , just go to the library and check them out . if you insist on reading this book i give you the same advice . do not buy this book -- check it out from your local library ! then do google searches to get more in-depth , accurate information about any of the four decent ideas she did have , or come back to amazon.com and find a more specific book that can actually be of use . oh , and by the way , the world is already overpopulated with unwanted pets . encouraging people to add to the problem is morally reprehensible
1	although everything is shown in silhouette , there is plenty of color and action and my kids ( boy and girl ; now 3 and 5 ) have always like it . there are herds of elephants , steaming machines , flowers , critters and more . as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i wo n't say more . but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they did n't like them . but i think they miss the point . the book is about *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage ' of a detailed picture . and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise , just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story . if you used pictures you 'd hardly learn anything about `shapes ' would you . no , the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds . for reaching for that aristotelian abstract ( lol ) of what is `skunk ' . and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss ' odd artwork . five stars . 19 pages of fun for boys and girls . this sturdy boardbook is a good read-aloud that stretches the imagination
1	as china re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century , much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world . oddly , the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao 's disastrous reign , even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge , heavily-populated , and ( from a western perspective ) oftentimes strange land . aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china , as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country . on a recent trip to china , i was highly impressed by the deep generosity , humility , resourcefulness , strength , perseverance , and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages . this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith . this spirit is also , i believe , one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese . also , those who are concerned that a `` christian china '' would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy . it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way
1	if you 're only slightly interested in the ways the evolution works , then this is it . but beware to have some knowledge about the basics of evolution before moving on to this book . there 's a bit of a steep learning curve when you 're not all to familiair with darwin 's brilliant theory . it also gives a nice insight in the way scientists work

0	one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters -- sunny randall and jesse stone -- robert b. parker has doubled our fun . quite the reverse . he has cut it in half . the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble ; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes , either . sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout . suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more . the villains -- buddy , erin , missy , gerard , moon -- are little more than vague names and stereotyping . spike is relegated to a scene and a half . oddly , the only interesting character is a very minor one : eddie . but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is tissue-thin . the love-story is lame ; the sex-scenes boring . worst of all , who should appear but ( christ ! ) susan silverman , from the spenser series : one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction . as with `` cold service '' and some others , parker is just coasting with this one . he is capable of far better .
0	i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book . his other books were so good . i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be . in applying some of the recommended techniques , my 11 year old daughter , emily , thought i lost my mind . thank goodness things are back to normal . we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice
0	i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown 's books in the past decade . her early books were utterly magnificent ; now , she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite ( and by now , utterly boring ) themes -- southern manners , horse bloodlines , and foxhunting . blessedly , `` whisker of evil '' was foxhunting-free , but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two . rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia , and many of us have grace , manners , and respect for others -- and we do n't take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things . that 's just simply not true . that said , there were some delightful aspects of `` whisker of evil '' -- the mystery itself was great , the animal characters were adorable as ever , and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick . her quitting the post office was a great ( and very unexpected ) twist . i liked reading more about her home and her relationships . however , the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me ; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of rita mae brown 's fan base ? it was so out of context in this book ; certain details contributed to the horses ' relationships to one another , but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages . as well , i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners . this is a common theme of ms. brown 's and it is quite frankly offensive . there is a big , big world outside of virginia -- rita mae brown should know this , she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial , insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world . i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it was n't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade . enough already about southern manners ( a biased perception at best ) , ancestor worship , bloodlines ( human and horse ) , and foxhunting . whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte
1	this book of eight stories by virginia woolf shows virginia 's mind at work demonstrating her `` stream of consciousness . '' each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life . for example , `` the mark on the wall '' questions the meaning of life and existence . `` an unwritten novel '' is about what people hide and what you do n't know about a person you seat next to on an `` omnibus . '' all these stories will make you look at life in a slightly different way
0	suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to rabbi david berger 's book , the rebbe , the messiah & amp ; the scandal of orthodox indifference
0	maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow . it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender . but , by the reviews here , all by women , i can see that jance writes to that crowd . her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible . if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you . it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue , the insulin bottle . jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story . do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time . if you want a good mystery read coben , crais , patterson or michael connely
0	i have not read the original version of this work , but the translation lacks originality and art . a beautiful story , but the writing style lacks grace and creativity . this is the only time i have liked a movie better than the book . do yourself a favor and skip the book . the movie is quite beautiful and moving
1	you do n't have to be a fan of `` old '' hollywood to enjoy this wonderful book about a famous restaurant and its even more famous clientele . fascinating stories accompanied by wonderful pictures . this is only enhanced by the actual recipes of this great restaurant . a wonderful coffee table book that will start conversations about movies , movie stars and great food
1	his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world , and that the united states is already an empire , but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force . ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life . thus , we get distracted too easily from important events overseas , and when we do try to intervene , we want quick fixes and low costs . i could n't agree more with most of these points . as an american , i 'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance . i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map . also , the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions . countless times , i believe america has done more harm than good by , if you will , talking the talk but not walking the walk . if we commit to something , we need to follow through . this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past . we 've claimed to support democracy in latin america , but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies . we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam 's suffering without changing the end result at all . with all this commonality , however , there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i ca n't bring myself to agree with . basically , he did n't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world . how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone ? wo n't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts ? when ferguson hold 's up the british empire as a model of success , i ca n't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization , with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there . and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii , so it probably was n't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state . even if the positive power of empire is conceded , there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now . it 's a concern of immunity from repercussions . in the golden age of imperialism , europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires . not to say that there were no reprercussions , but , with the only modern navies in the world , europe was immune to any very serious threats . on the other hand , in today 's world , as an effect of globalization , power has become more decentralized in some respects . think wmds , terrorists , and foreign investments in the u.s. economy , for example . can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could ? in the end `` colossus '' did n't settle any agruments for me , but raised new and interesting questions . it is a book that makes you think , and that in and of itself is worth four stars .

1	according to charles kimball , religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth . religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests , while at the same time , more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution . using a comparative religious approach , kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil . kimball argues the word `religion ' is amorphous and difficult to define . as a result , the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary , one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions . kimball , next , asks if religion is the cause of evil , and he answers both yes and no . a religion that is arrogant , condescending , and requires adherents to `` disconnect their brain '' is problematic . on the other hand , religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community . kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil . the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims . when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine , the propensity towards evil increases dramatically . sacred texts , sources of wisdom and guidance , become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims . christianity and islam have missionary mandates , but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims . kimball argues for a `` human view of truth '' , one that is dynamic and relational , allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions . another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience : when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities . when a charismatic leader demands total obedience , has unrestricted power , and has total control , religion is unhealthy . uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy , as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection . strict segregation from the larger society , combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous . kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence . every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth , while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future . when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time , the likelihood for disaster increases . many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society , zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status , and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind . kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god 's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous . religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means : when one theological component gets elevated , thus becoming an end , and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end . all religions have notions of sacred space , but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space . reinforcing or protecting group identity against an `other ' , or protecting group identity from within the group , are also potentially dangerous signs . institutional structures develop in all religious traditions , but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end . kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends . the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a `` holy '' war . kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity , and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91 . islam is a peaceful religion , which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order . the word jihad means `` struggling in the way of god , '' but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory . because of socio-economic disparities , some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends , and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause . kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy . with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil , religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis . faith , hope , and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents , so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted . against secularism , kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards , and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity . with religious diversity christians have three options , exclusivism , inclusivism , and pluralism , but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity . finally , the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community : if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict , then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak
1	williams 's ear for dialogue , his eye for character , his exploration of love , longing and loneliness are as powerful in these short stories as they are in his plays . on occasion , the glimmer of a future work rises out of the text , such as the line , `` but the sweet bird of youth had flown from pablo gonzales ... ''
1	they are books like those written by stephen ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning . some have accused ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts . to those i would say , bah humbug ! this book is well written and worthy of the readers time , unless , of course , you are a `` fact-checker '' , in which case the original sources , to the extent they even exist , might be more to your liking . for orginary joe 's , like me , mr. ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information . i would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the indian wars
0	before i bought the pasajes series , i was relieved to see the ( then ) mostly positive reviews . however , i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very , very misleading . i would not , in good faith , be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish . this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with . some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish : 1 ) the concepts are not clearly explained ( they invented a `` new '' english word for one ) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them . 2 ) frequently , new words , phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else , via a footnote , with no further explaination provided ! ! this is super frustrating and distracting ! 3 ) using this series of books is very cumbersome , the books are not well coordinated with one another , and do not appear to reinforce each other 's concepts or vocabulary . i 'm very sorry , but these books are just terrible , and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books ... using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish , which i used to enjoy . if you have the option to use different books , take it
0	not a great deal of new insight here . i did learn a bit more than i knew , however , about meade 's failure to pursue at gettysburg . mr. boritt is the editor and author of one essay ; other essays are by four historians : stephen w. sears , mark e. neely , jr. , michael fellman , and john y. simon .

0	when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra/ cleopatra with a `` k '' - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character- essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n't work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit ... unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george .
0	the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj 's guilt . [ there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge ! ] you wo n't learn anything new from this book . it has a long list of books on the subject , but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them . were they all equal in quality ? the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment . the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news . could it have been intended as a distraction from other news ? in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war ; this was repeated weekly . in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea ( must have been a success , since the propaganda stopped ) . could the double murders in brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction ? is n't two murders a day the usual la statistics ? how many other waiters ( just from mezzaluna ) were murdered each year ? are murders by organized crime often solved ? the book `` killing time '' noted that restaurants and health clubs ( in la and elsewhere ) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution . if this explains the murders , you wo n't find much in this book . [ my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment . ]
0	i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work . people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original ; are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there . how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original , in the original chinese , and if that the case they should write their own version
1	after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes noble that same night . dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions ! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors . we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers . however , if at home you are on dr. whitley 's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front . although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of `` mr. rogers '' in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents . of course , that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he/she is capable of `` frightening '' resistance . obviously , professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley 's methods would be more advisable than his book ! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders . these kids still have some moldability and are n't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem ( i.e . depression ) . for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author ; 0 )

0	perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses , boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others . lacking even the slightest trace of shame , he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses . as a result , there 's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages . even more pitiably , like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to `` sanitize '' his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source , boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed . one wearies quickly of the manichaean results . and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear ( or social ) engineer , he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally , succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was . why , even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home 's 1977 underground classic , `` a savage war of peace '' ! * considering that home 's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot 's , this is irony most profound . it is scarcely surprising , then , that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot 's book , thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot 's espoused belief system . * recently reprinted and highly recommended !
0	this book is a place to start at best . the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices . this book calls for dried spices at times . the dishes do n't produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family . the book is not a total loss , however . the spinach pies are acceptable . there are many other books out there that i would recommend first
0	it 's surprising to see how much the front and back cover promise only to find out how little information and substance it actually delivers . the book is very basic providing mostly very general information . the chapter on shift levers is particularly incomplete with outdated examples and few details on maintenance and repairs . the book may suffer from trying to cover both road and mountain bikes and doing a poor job with both . certainly wo n't purchase another book recommended or endorsed by bicycling magazine
0	what a chore this book was to read . if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start , i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up . it seems like a wannabe-suspense , but it 's not . it seems like there might be a love story in it , but there 's not . it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it , but there is not . what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy . she tries to make a connection , but falls way short . read vinegar hill - that one was worth it . pass midnight champagne by
0	i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here , who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper 's `` the dark is rising '' is plain awful . this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read . i must say it was a waste of my time to read `` dark . '' never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero . in this case , we are told that on his 11th birthday , an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of `` the old ones . '' unlike jk rowling who , in the first pages of harry potter the philosopher 's ( or sorcerer 's ) stone , provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny , with an unruly mop of black hair , startlingly green eyes , and , of course , a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead , cooper does not describe will stanton at all . the result is that the reader , after having read 244 pages , still can not visualize what will looks like ! ! i also find quite annoying cooper 's approach to this good vs. evil tale . she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones , and who or what exactly is the dark . as for the dark being evil , all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold , snow , and -- of course -- darkness . excuse me : but is this the best cooper can do ? is this what this book is about ? -- the druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark , summer vs. winter , warmth vs. cold ? what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil ?
0	this collection of poems , tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson 's works , is in final assessment a crime against the poet 's great talent . as is freely admitted in the introduction , the editor , mr. higginson , `` worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter , changing the line arrangements , and rewriting the dialect of the local area . '' this is a free admission of the book 's guilt , having adulterated dickenson 's original poems in both content and form . gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers . gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems ' meanings . and , worst of all , gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist . as thomas h. johnson says in the introduction to `` the complete poems of emily dickenson , '' a representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate . '' do yourself a favor and avoid this text . instead , find one that is true to the original poems , one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author , and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson

1	carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources . hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove . the plot revolves around mother paula 's pancake house , a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls . the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records . unwary citizens applaud mother paula 's in coconut cove . the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers . he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister , beatrice and new kid , roy . beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana , earning the dubious title of cowgirl . when you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you 've got a pretty good read !

0	unfortunately , for all the name brand that this book conveys , i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part . there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales , boggles this readers mind . the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session . no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book , and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book , i would be astounded . save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation . by the way , those giving 5 stars either ca n't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey

0	very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story . i add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism , but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate , but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run . there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained , but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade . these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton . repubs kept the song going without missing a beat . most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties . feel free to read to learn about terms , just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
0	the author tries to bring both the biography of walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither . it is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time , but , after reading the title and reviews , i was hoping for a detailed biography of walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers . instead , it is a general overview of walsingham 's life with references to the work that he did . there are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of elizabeth i . if you want details and a better understanding of walsingham the man , and his life work and actions , you will need to look elsewhere

0	how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest ? one answer : write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases . another : strive to break the record for most clich ? s in a single paragraph . finally : write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus , everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon . simon and the raccoons ; simon on the failing american economy ; simon attempting to reproduce american accents . this is a cd set for avoiding
0	i am in the planning stages of a new business venture . i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself . this book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author 's friends have used them . it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan , and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends . the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created . he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks . hello ! ! ! mcfly ! ! ! did n't i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights ? yes ! so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information , and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career ? my price of admission stops at the price of this book , and it should not seem like i 'm only getting half of the story that i paid for !
1	i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind can not be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99,99 % of neurobiologists , such as steven pinker ) . this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann . the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very important . read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :
0	`` the other boleyn girl '' and `` the queen 's fool '' are two of the best books i 've ever read -- and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me . they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete -- true masterpieces . so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . `` the virgin 's lover '' fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up . one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly -- that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer . anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse . they feel forced , constructed . i 'm going back to trollope
1	. . .maybe believe your suspenders , i 'm not sure which . it seems to me that to enjoy this book , you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability . you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who 's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable . what you get in return are some amazing language , some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish . much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now , this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked-out , but craftsman-like writing

1	as crow puts it , if it had not snowed on that monday in march . the snow led to a chain of circumstances with crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night . it turns out that the teenager , lloyd , was a witness to a crime , and that draws tess into the case when she connects lloyd to a news reporter . events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source . the story starts with a narration by crow , and alternates between crow , tess , and other characters in the story . you will get a lot more crow in this novel than in others . the story has an interesting ending , and you can wonder if lloyd will show up again . you get some information along the way about baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless , and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap
0	[ the above is an actual quote from the book ] i do n't usually read romances , but got this one at the library . i thought : thriller . hijacked plane , navy seal ... all the right stuff . and the beginning was promising . stan fixes everything , and has a human side to him that was compelling . then the plot hit the fan ! as a thriller it stunk . the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly , as an after thought . the romantic `` tension '' between the protagonists was forced and irritating . the dialogue is mundane . the message that horniness leads to true romantic ( sam and alyssa ) love is rubbish . the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl , and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed . the historic ( wwii ) componant was interesting . but overall , i kept asking who the audience is for this book . not lovers of thrillers like me -- and i wonder , do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane , or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him !

0	all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover . they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture . the reader longs for the pair to actually do something . in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings . that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking . i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones , now i know why

0	seven times the sun is not for everyone . it could be a springboard , offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life . but the songs , poems and traditions offered in shea darian 's book are hokey and contrived at best , cumbersome and artificial at worst . none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book . darian is a minister , and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent . true , parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have . but i 'm just thankful amazon has a customer-friendly return policy
1	this cookbook has become one of my favorites . i grew up in se texas , and once i moved away , no mexican food could compare . now i have the understanding on what differeintiates tex-mex and mexican food . the recipes are exact and delicious . i love the pictures , the stories and most of all the inspiration to cook my favorite meals ! its definately a book for any tex mex lover , i highly reccomend it . just try and sit and read it and not have your mouth water
0	you get a view into 60 's white america . the only people of color in this book are a policeman , and a caricature . i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe . this is set in everyday life , and i think its best left on the bookshelf , it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair , not to mention various shades of skin colour . the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional white depiction of the world
1	this is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time . it 's finally here and it 's outstanding ! now when i take apart an owl pellet i 'll be able to determine what the owl was eating , and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area . and when i 'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal , bird , amphibian , or reptile , i 'll be able to find what that is too . mark elbrock has done it again : an instant classic , and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection
1	did we need a gore vidal reader ? the author is something of a long-winded blowhard , commenting at length ( and i mean length ) on every topic imaginable . in that respect he is america 's voltaire , creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics , the arts , and religion and morals . it 's hard to say where vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism , as he is not a conventional leftist . because of his iconoclasm , this collection can only inform the reader about gore vidal , not his times nor any intellectual or political movement . all that said , vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit . this book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a vidal fan ( or , say , a reader of `` the nation '' ) this book is worth the time commitment
0	i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years . however , this book is misleading and dangerous . almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem ( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries ) . writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen , and provide plenty of `` references '' to support this premise . tragically , in the long term , global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust . i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that , in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining , he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books . there is a quote : `` with great power comes great responsibility . '' but in this case it would seem : `` with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet .
0	let me start by saying that normally i 'm a big popcorn fan . i read any article that she 's quoted in . i 've read `` the popcorn report '' at least twice and loved it . the same for `` clicking . '' great book . they 're part of my permanent library . so i was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of eveolution . i hung in there as long as i could , but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way . i just could n't tolerate reading any more . perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people 's view , but i did n't see how they fit in with the intent of the book . the comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary . so hopefully her next book will be better .
0	the worst book i 've read ( actually , i was listening to the audiobook ) . the characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that i found myself yelling at the tape player , `` i know , i know already '' . i could n't stand the torture anymore , i did n't even finish it . i have enjoyed some of ds 's earlier work , but will not buy another
0	i do n't know why it won the national book award . this book is very slow , & amp ; very boring . where is the action ? i forced myself to finish it
1	this book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of uml one really needs to know
1	yo money . this book really puts it all into perspective . i like fish and gritts . after reading this book i can break doors and stuff . i am one with the universe . gard your gril
1	because the ideas and strategies really work ! robert allen gives more concrete information , real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book . i used the ideas from robert allen to buy my first home , nothing down 5 years ago and the value of my home has escalated but ... the return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite ! hey ... if you do n't like robert allen , you can always read jane bryant quinn and lose money with her advice . i was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over 75 % of his 401 ( k ) money following quinn 's `` safe '' advice . or ... you can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized robert allen ideas
0	the text gets 5 stars for the orientation , organization , and the on-line resources for the text . it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course . unfortunately , i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make . this has been frustrating for my students , as well as myself . however , i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up , the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market . i strongly recommend a new , corrected edition
1	i 'm sure most people will come to fitzgerald through her novels , so i have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories . i still have n't decided if i enjoyed the collection , but they are unique . i thought the first story was by far the best , but after that , the quality varied widely . unlike a classic short story writer ( someone like guy de mauppassant ) , these stories have no resolution for the most part . in fact , they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key . discordant is the word i 'm looking for . the settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries . i suspect most would enjoy her novels more ( i am certainly heading in that direction to read them next ) , but i ca n't say since i have n't read them myself . overall , i found this collection a bit unsettling , but still well written . i 'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than i did on this first encounter
0	this book is total self-propogating hogwash . garbage . save your money , and your life , avoid this book like a big mac
1	this story is true to life living in south west and west phila . it brought back many memories and changing the names did not bother me . i really enjoyed reading about life the way it was back in the 55 to 70 era . yes this was life in phila row home .
1	when someone goes to the time and effort to expose the watertower bible company and death brokers , they get five stars from me . america is overflowing with former jehovah 's witnesses that are now living shattered lives . so , the more such books there are saturating the market , the more likely it is someone will read just the right book that will keep them from getting involved in this end of the world death-cult . or help a poor suffering jw find their way out . david reed , thank you for both of your fine books . may they be read far and wide and in between ! read i was a teenage jehovah 's witness and jehovah unmasked for two of the wildest rides ever !
0	i purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag
1	i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere . but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women 's movement , that as such it fills a long-felt-want , and that it is to be recommended to those new to , unfamiliar with , or who feel they should be allied with , the women 's movement . it would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women 's studies , as to those doing social movement studies , whether globally or more locally . summarising , antrobus shows the women 's movement as political , as recognising women 's relationship to social conditions , as processal , as posed against patriarchal privilege , as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation , marginalisation , isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation . one complaint , but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone . this is the avoidance of the word `capitalism ' - even by feminists who are or were once socialists . capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus . capitalists , mostly after all male , white and patriarchal , call it capitalism , and are proud of it . so why can not it not be so named by feminists , who could and surely should condemn it ? this can not be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism of patriarchal socialists . so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonfähig ( acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking , to the funders they are dependent upon ) , or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder , gentler global capitalism , a global neo-keynesian order - for which no convincing feminist case has been made . pity
1	this is a great book . well written and illustrated . this is one of the most hilarious children 's books i 've read to my child . we were laughing throughout the whole thing . i highly recommend this book to both children and adults
1	this is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice . it is one of those books that is simply fun to read , particularly to the wee ones at bed time . the illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid . very nice illustrations , well done . recommend this one highly .
1	... in the beginnig of the 1930 's , the turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the armenian genocide that took place in 1915/16 . turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the us-government in 1933 though , when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book , so the then us-government again put pressure on mgm not to make this movie . a foreign government coerced censorship in the unites states : just imagine that ! i hope the the making of the movie
0	this book has its good points . if anything , it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor , but it is not very accurate . the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you , or if they do n't describe you at all . this messes up the results , and it did not describe me very well . i am not just in denial . i have taken a lot of personality type tests , like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths . so , although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths , it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology . as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees , i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate . the company i work for has done this , and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths ( according to this book ) are very unhappy in their new positions . your money can be spent better elsewhere . i say its only worth about $ 10
1	peck relates growing up in rural/small town vermont with a best friend who gets him into lots of trouble . humor and pranks abound in between lessons learned
1	digital photography is a fast-moving target , and this book manages to keep abreast of the latest changes with valuable information that 's vital for anyone doing digital photography . it explains all the key concepts clearly and completely , with lots of advice on getting the best photographs with any type of digital camera . i would have liked additional coverage of digital slrs , but i have found that elsewhere , and still prefer complete digital photography 's treatment of the broader topics
0	the first novel of laurell k. hamilton 's merry gentry series is not , actually , that terrible a book . it 's by far the best in a not particularly great series , actually . what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise , the set-up , is one of the most grotesquely , ridiculously stupid things i 've ever read . princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie , in fear of death at the hands of her aunt , andais , the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court . high profile fae in this world are major public figures , like rock stars or the royal family of england . the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed . every news media in the world reports the story ... .and it never goes away . we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings . meredith 's image , the story of her mysterious disappearance , is everywhere . i mean , neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is , and what she looks like . meanwhile , princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye . thing is , she has n't disguised herself very much at all . her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin . her fae red hair is now human red hair . her facial features remain the same . and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith , for years on end , no one recognizes her . let me hasten to add , there is no magic involved in this , they honestly simply do n't recognize her . and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise , the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she 's actually princess meredith is ... .wait for it ... .merry gentry . jesus wept . and for years , none of her co-workers , no one who knows her , says to themself , `` hey , wait a minute , that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith ... .merry gentry ... .princess meredith ... .oh my god , merry gentry is princess meredith ! '' nope , she 's just incognito , baby . at which point i almost threw down the book and said , `` you have got to be kidding me . '' it 's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process . do laurell hamilton 's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing ? given her past six or eight novels , including this one , i 'm tempted to say : no , actually
1	tim russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad . in fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was . the most precious things a father can provide are time , attention , and love . this book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know . great work ! keep it up , tim ! -- i also watch most of tim 's tv programs .
1	interesting . i never knew there were so many varities of garlic and onions . i 'll be growing some next year
0	ugh . i did not even try to finish the book . it is full of sexual content . not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature
0	no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his `` experimental school . '' who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of `` progressivism ? '' i would . dewey 's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study . this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child 's self-posed questions . the problems in dewey 's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design : the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive . classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials . as if kids did n't have enough problems with the basic skills set already , dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics . even more outrageous in dewey 's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like . their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication , teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards . experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects , and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind . how could dewey 's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child 's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance ? deweyism of course , like many other off-the-wall theories of education , denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man . it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality . nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted , particularly project follow through : the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates ' closet . i 'd personally like to see dewey 's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids , who come into class with their `` natural inquisitiveness '' programmed by tv , rap music , and other pop media , into colonial american history , calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes , tennessee williams , and the `` plus-que-parfait '' tense . but of course , such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system . 90 % of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged . maybe the answer does n't lie in yielding to children 's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice . dewey 's `` progressivism '' relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education . from the absurdity of it , i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates , lowered standards , and social discord . but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
1	a classic ! i loved paddington as a child and i 'm thrilled to have this in our cd collection . ( i 'd even listen without the kids ! ) . stephen fry reads the stories very well
1	`` i have shooting pains in my upper left arm . '' said the pilot to brian . brian is the main character in the book hatchet . this book would be for someone who likes survival in the wilderness or even just survival . i like this book because i am into this type of writing . i think gary paulson is a very intelegant man because ... ..who could have thought of a book about a boy who his plain crashes into the canadian wilderness and ... ... ... ... .do you think he survived the wilderness ? ... ... ... he does survive the wilderness ! submitted by : peanut !
1	i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research & amp ; of tracking earnings estimates . mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform . the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years ... it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate , and more imporartantly a successful investing method ... this is the first book i have read that has actually helped me make money , rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads . overall good book , i would definitely recommend it
1	love letters has a very simple concept : two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage . they never look at each other . but within these letters is so much humor , love , and truth that the play will carry you away with delight . i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore . i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i 'd heard so much about it . after page three , i did n't want to put it down . now i 'm buying it for a friend . do n't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder . if you have ever been in love , you will recognize parts of yourself in this . it always stays true to its well-drawn characters , which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful
0	do n't bother buying 'the wonder of girls , borrow it from a friend cause it will only make a turn around the office with many a snicker.i could n't think of a girl i grew up with including myself who needed constant reassurance or had more trouble with math than boys.i agree with the other review about we grow our own brains and make connections.infact , research shows if you give any child a chance at spatial tasks , the child improves.girls often are given dolls . , so how can a girl develope spatial ability playing with a doll ? go fig ! gurian does n't tell the reader anything about experience and environment ~ instead he is vocal about fixed brain function which of course leaves a child in a narrow subgroup.girls are all lumped into one.i would n't let your daughter read this book , 'it might give her a bad case of low self~esteem and leave her wondering about herself as a woman.gurian wants women in second place at best.teach your daughter to believe in herself not some pop psychology from a questionable author bent on messing with her success
0	the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well . the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation . why could the equation not be solved ? there is a reason for this fact , and the mathematical theory explains it well -- but not this book . perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation can not be solved in general . the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book ; but apparently not in this one
