1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best . the thickness ( 1/8 inch ) is just perfect - not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning . what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip , in a word , it is comfortable .
0	after 2 attempts at having this shipped to me , and both times having it arrive broken . i have given up this model . it 's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating . if you can buy one at the store , it may be a great unit , but do n't let it go ups
1	this gun was great . when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it . good for kids just starting out with bb guns . also it is n't that powerful . overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is $ 0.0
1	it had special meaning for me , because when my two daughters were little ( they are now in their late 30s ) , i taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they did n't flush . i caught them both with the toilet monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences . it is more funny than scary , though it does give you a start when you first open the lid
1	by wife and i bought both the men and womens model . they were a great buy , arrived on time and were easy to assemble . they 're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built . enjoy .
0	i got this because it was cheap at k-mart , and thank goodness i can return it . the ball is really small -- i love how they omit the size from all of their information . i did n't pump it up with the pump , so i do n't know how good that is ( i used an air compressor ) ... the other equipment is n't too bad , but i was really getting this for the ball , which just so happens to be a piece of poopola . i would n't suggest getting this
1	the display did n't work on the first rower we got , and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken . amazon sent out a new one the day i reported the problem , and helped me get ups to pick up the damaged one . the second rower arrived in good shape , and works fine . the different programs are nice , it 's extremely quiet , and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the y . the slightly padded seat is also a bonus . one of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor . it comes with the chest strap , and displays heart rate on the lcd screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone . the heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers , and with some of the more expensive ones , you still have to buy the chest transducer separately . overall , quite satisfied with the rower , and because of their excellent customer service , extrememly satisfied with amazon
0	you 've got a lot of ab-rollers . you need a gimmick : the product is no better than the competition . you do n't have an ad budget . what do you do ? charge four times as much . then just sit and wait for the 'clients ' who are looking for a 'quality ' product to assume that the high price actually means something
1	we just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old . it is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride . he is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar . on the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter , but i do n't see how . it is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it . overall , the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking , a back pedal and hand brake . the styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage . i would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful . the enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and i was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions . putting it together is somewhat intuitive , and i did figure it out , but better directions would have been much appreciated .
1	we bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday . he loves it ! his older brother ( 3 1/2 ) has the regular razor scooter , but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself . this kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother . good for the younger kids , but it does not go as fast as the regular razor . as a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two . definetly worth the money though . he just loves it !
1	we used it today , for the first time and it works just fine . heats quickly and is easy to pour
0	we bought this tractor from joe brands . it was a big disappointment ! it was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the joe brands site . when i contacted joe brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100 % . they refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them . they told me i had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in wisconsin instead of back to joe brands in colorado . i am in las vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to wisconsin instead of colorado . when i bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping . after i shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial `` free shipping '' and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund . i am out over $ 100 because of joe brands . if you buy from joe brands you may be sorry !
0	this front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when i went over a medium sized rock
1	living in europe , my husband and i were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in usa . however , knowing the reputation of amazon , we risked it . our final choice was the women 's ranger by schwinn . it was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive . the bike is beautiful and we - and our daughter - are thrilled . it is made of high quality components , yet is fairly light . it is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets , which is where our daughter will be cycling . the gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent . as a footnote , the first bike arrived with slight defects , was returned to amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back ! we were most impressed ! the second bike is perfect ! it looks so good too - quite important for women
0	this tent is alright . its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts . i bought it in the spring and this fall , with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage . i do n't really think its worth the money . it is very spacious , just wish it was better made .
1	if you can stick to a workout routine , this home gym is perfect for you . after a bit of assembly , you 'll be able to do all your exercises at home
0	this is very heavy and hard to fit anywhere for storage . very hard to use even when you adjust the tension to a low setting . i tried working out on it for about a week and gave up ... it will most likely be tossed
0	i regret buying this gun . it broke within four days of buying it . we did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up ( for accuracy ) , and it fired great . it was really accurate . the gun was made of really cheap plastic , and the trigger stopped working . right now , we 're waiting for a rma on it . i would recommend paying a little extra , to buy a more durable gun . i bought another gun that cost $ 55 , and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable
0	i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services . i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase . ( mine in three months . ) the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself . ( in one occasion , they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it 's good . ) these back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months , and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you , even though it 's still within one year . i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise , not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying : `` this is our policy .
1	i would give this 3.5 stars if possible . its a decent table , the chip holders/with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference . the table itself seems to be a piece of plywood , with some green felt tacked both sides of it ; and slots cut out for the chip trays . it works , but could have been a nicer , better made product for the money . watch out for the shipping costs , almost 1/3 the price of the table . pretty expensive
1	my daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off
1	now , i have been playing tennis for 8 years and i must say , this is my favorite racket i have used . i have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more . it seems head liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and i have seen more players using them within the last year or so . for me , the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months . however , if you play at a less competitive level . they will break twice a year maybe . if you 're just starting to play tennis , i do n't think this would be a good racket to begin with , however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term , this is the racket you need . enjoy
0	these provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating . however , i 've had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart . i am not sure how long they will last . i purchased these to replace a similar set i had for 9 years , which were worn , but not falling apart . now i wish i had not thown the old ones away .
0	for $ 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging , with a bonus pedometer . the radio has no channel display , and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial , then a scan button . when walking , it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial , but if yours is n't this could be terribly annoying . as for the pedometer , it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband , and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when i was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless . i 'm sending it back
0	one of the handles would not go in , the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when i would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction . they told me to send it back for a replacement and i 'm still waiting and waiting ! ! ! so i would rate this unit a -0- how do i get my monies back ? ? ?
0	this handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing . the adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable . do n't risk your safety or your dollars on this product . it 's simply not worth the inexpensive price
1	great condition ... made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs ... and the dolphins are my team ! ! ( she wo n't forget her gave her this one ! ) quick service ... great packaging
0	a real colorful and flashy bike , however there were several things wrong with it . 1. the tires had so much excess rubber , it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed . 2 . the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings . if not done , the bike would basically come to a stop by itself . 3. the main ( front ) sprocket is slightly bent , so the chain falls off constantly . 4. the bike if very heavy . maybe that makes it sturdy , but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride . i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal-mart or target for half the price
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month , for a 5 day-a-week practice . at first i was thrilled , but at the end of my 2nd class , i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet . it 's continued to get worse and worse , 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice , and scatter on the floor around me . since i practice in a studio , it 's particularly annoying . i practice with the `` sticky '' side down , and the jute side up . the jute side is the side that flakes . practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem , but then the mat inchworms across the floor .
0	this is marys suns review . it broke in 2 days , first the full auto went then the shooting in general . dont get i
0	i am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new leatherman tools . i purchased two leatherman squirt s4 's and the leatherman micra from amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up ( like it was used before ) . some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool . i purchased the leatherman charge xti from another vendor , which was also not of high quality that leatherman was once known for . i have owned the original leatherman wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it . it seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control . or maybe someone is repackaging used leatherman tools and selling them as new ... i will not be buying anymore leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for . if you want to buy one of these , either for yourself or as a gift , i would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy . make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems ... the ones i recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts
1	i bought an older model of the petzl e32 p myolite 3 headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the grand canyon . although it works well when on the move , whether for hiking at night , or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine , it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location : - a : even when using the 3-leds ( which is the less-bright option ) , it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading , nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy . - b : even when using the 3-leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read , since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you . also , the weight is a bit heavy on one 's head . it is for these reasons that i just went out and bought the black diamond zenix iq for my upcoming trip to yosemite . i have been playing with it in my apartment tonight ( with the lights turned off ) , and i can already tell that this black diamond model is far superior to the petzl i bought 2 years ago . the zenix iq has the following features : - it is much lighter and more comfortable than the petzel - it has 6 brightness settings ( as opposed to petzel 's 2 ) : it has 3 settings for the two leds , and it has 3 settings for the ultra-bright bulb . - it has a multi-function colored led that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night ( when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp ) , and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low
0	i held high hopes for the product - being that i live in a little apartment in nyc , i was looking forward to saving space . the tune-up stand is little/portable , however it was not too sturdy . the bike , while on the stand , will not withstand much torque at all . the bike fell over many times before i gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand . forget about turning the crank , the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over . this stand would be good for light work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag . any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike . overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person 's bike or a bmx . i used it on a men 's road bike size 57 .
0	the set is fine , however the crate was completely busted up . i will think twice before i order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all . i was going to try and get a refund , but i am not going to pay to have it returned . however , if the `` powers that be '' might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful . an amazon patron , iri
1	these roller blades are great they were n't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i 'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out . i recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well .
0	the advertising was not clear as to what your getting ; it does not include the stand for the ball assembly
1	i just received the blackburn delphi 6.0 earlier this week , and i 've already put it through a few rides . i 'm upgrading from a cateye astrale 8 that i 've had for a long time . i 've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately , and i thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great . i almost bought the delphi 5.0 a while ago , but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features . here are my impressions about my new computer , good and bad ... pros : - the mounting bracket system is very clever , and seems better that the cateye bracket i was used to . changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp , changing the fit for different handlebar diameters . 3 different thicknesses are included , which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars . - the altimeter function is great . the altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate . the percent grade reading acts sensibly , even though it lags a little ( this is explained in the manual ) . the distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software , and works far better than the gps-based solution i had been using . - the lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride . had a big hill on your route , and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade ? the delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole . up to 20 laps can be recorded . i think of them less as `` laps '' and more as `` intervals '' . - the backlight feature is very cool . i 've always just done without computer info at night before ... but this way , i do n't have to . i 'm sure it kills batteries , but it 's nice to have . cons : - the average speed algorithm seems a little flaky . it seems to read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time . my cateye always agreed well with the calculated value , but the way the delphi is figuring the average must be different . this is liveable , and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping . - the max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent `` spikes '' , so that the real max hr is unknown . finishing a ride , it 's possible that the max hr will show something unrealistic like 235 , probably due to a signal glitch or some interference . then , you have no way of knowing what the true value is . these spikes do n't affect the average , however . i should mention that i 've seen this behavior on both of the standalone hrms i 've had before ... so it 's not unique to the delphi . - the cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor . i had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank , because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point . but mounted there , the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle . if you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove , that could be a problem . they could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker . for comparison , my cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem . - the wire from the cadence-enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long . this may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something , and i admit that too long is better than too short . but i have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings , and it 's hard to tuck that slack away . and i have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare . - unlike my standalone hrms , the delphi does n't calculate calories used . not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway , but it would be nice for ride-to-ride comparison . general thoughts overall , i think it 's a great computer . the negatives above all are really minor issues , and i have n't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price . there 's a lot more to tell than i can include in a review like this . i 'm just trying to hit the big highlights ( and lowlights ) . but definitely , no regrets on this end for buying it .
1	i have been battling hard since my cards arrived . thank you for such a great deal
1	this product is pretty much what i expected . the latex is a little dusty looking -- not a clean crisp red at all . however , it gets the job done for those pilates exercises
1	these are definatly very accurate . the seem is barely visable . in pistols these dont really crack , but in my aeg rifle , which is 360fps , these crack at close distance . but keep in mind these are light .12g 's and .20g 's a rerecommended for aeg 's . 4 out of 5 , nice polished accurate bb 's
1	i 'm not an expert on footballs , but i have n't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing . it 's easy to grip and throw , and it does n't have that cheesy `` hey i 'm a recreational football '' look to it . good deal for the money
0	the only reason why i am not buying this product , is because the description does n't give the lengh . how stupid ... ! ! ! i am sure i am not the only one to turn this great product down . come on , think a little and tell us how long it is
1	the backpack is great . it is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy . you can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it . it secures well , and dogs love it . if you give a dog a job , they really feel useful , and i think they appreciate it a lot
1	i knew i wanted a bowflex and could n't decide between the models available . this model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my `` spare/exercise '' room for a weekend guest . this product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team ( a husband/wife team worked for us ) . this is the first exercise equipment i have been consistent with . it is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets . i also have the ab attachment . love it
0	this stuff has a very strong smell -- like wd-40 or something . if you can stand the smell , you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt . i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless , like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought . but it is n't odorless . it really stinks . i do n't like that permeating smell in my house , especially in my workout room . i recommend the lifespan 100 % silicone lubricant . it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive , but it 's the good ( odorless ) stuff
0	bed is not even after few hours of sleep , very difficult if two people are sharing the bed , when one rolls in the sleep other person wakes worse still you will get up with back pain , shoulder pain even if you manage to sleep .
0	when it is windy , the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage . no information is available on how long it takes to do this . i called d.c. america and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at . they said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble . one retailer i spoke with , fogdog , guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top , but he admitted they have not tried assembling it . so it appears from what these two sources said that every time a wind storm comes up , it would require half-a-day to disassemble it then reassemble it - not something i care to do . are there any owners out there that can answer this question ? can the frame be left up and only the top covering removed ? if so , how long would it take to remove the top covering ? is it easy to do ? it is a nice looking unit , but unfortunately the sellers can not answer the most basic question for an item like this . thanks .
0	goal frame is okay but net is a pile of pants and does not last five mins . cant seem to buy replacement
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating . i would recommend a different mat . cheer
0	i bought one of the brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $ 99.00 ( on february 1 , 2007 ) , based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time . initially , i was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly . instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm , my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms . this may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use . i contacted brookstone customer service to request a replacement part ( i needed two right-hand pedals ) the evening i received the shipment . i had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal . when , at one point , i mentioned simply returning the exercise bike , the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because -- as i waited for the new part -- i 'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy ! with the new pedal finally in place , i immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed ( though , unfortunately , not surprised ) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot . the mini-bike is quite noisy and so far , i 've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use -- either on a rug or on linoleum . as a result , i have to back it up against a desk , file cabinet , or bookcase to use . this product has been a huge disappointment and i would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money -- even at the reduced price -- on this product .
0	i tried this on the day i got it to see how it felt . the velcro is so strong that when i tried to take it off , the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off . i would not advise buying this . i was dissappointed in the quality of this product .
0	from the previous reviews it seems that this product does n't deliver any satisfaction at all . buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.i bought one eight months ago and i loved it . i use it at home and even at the gym , since it is small and very light , so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves . the one i bought is really an excellent accessory , since is not only a wrist exerciser , but a complete forearm strengthener . simple to use , with no spring or moving or breakable parts , it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use . with simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands , wrist , forearms and upper arms . i have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power , and also feel an increased range of motion and flexibilit

1	timberland 's are in no matter what the season.. i mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear . you know you ca n't have just one pair or one color so just go ahead..get them
0	i should have heeded the bad reviews on this site . i purchased this as a christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient . it was dead on arrival . i tried a new battery , still dead on arrival . both batteries tested ok , clearly it 's a dead unit . i contacted the new manufacturer ( not pni as advertised ) and am awaiting a response . i ca n't recommend this product .
0	i was unable to use this treadmill for several reasons . one , the belt will not stay centered . it shifts to one side and then starts rubbing on the metal guides intended to keep it centered . if i were able to get the belt to turn with out a large amount of force , the second problem , it would soon be torn by the guides . as i said the second problem is the belt will not move without a lot of force . i had to lean over and put so much force down that after only 3 minutes my legs were cramping . if i tried to stand up and just walk normally the belt would not move . also like others several of the plastic knobs were broken and it was either a used unit or the numerous scratches happened during shipping
0	we bought 2 of these `` things '' they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receipt the stitching , in various parts of the bag came undone , we ended up throwing them away . i 've been purchasing things on line since 1995 , and this product was by far the worst thing we 've ever bought ! ! ! run away , run away
0	i was attracted to the thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear , and because thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day . the product indeed has a clever-seeming design , and it is well manufactured . but ultimately , this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that feels to me like it needs to be stretched . ( i.e. , the area along the sole of my foot that i can feel stretching out in the mornings when , before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it , i press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel ; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed . ) the velcro fastenings are indeed secure , but the product 's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they 'll go ; as a result , what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down . worse , the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just does n't create the proper stretch ; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy . i 'm going to try a rigid split , which may be less comfortable . but i believe that i need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle , which the thermoskin product does n't . and i 'd rather incur some discomfort , if it will actually help me get well , than continue to use this not too uncomfortable ( but ineffective ) product from thermoskin . perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than i have had ; and i have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what i 've read on the internet , so consider this to be very much a layman 's review . i 've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement , and i ca n't compare this product to others that i hope might be more effective . but i was very disappointed in this product , and regret having spent the money for it
1	i started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago . i picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head . it has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have $ 200+ racquets
1	the mirror and its attachment is better than the ones i have purchased , however , the attachment does not addapt to all helmets . i have two helmets by specialized : one i had no problem attaching to , the other , the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly . it would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets . this would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment . whether or not you print this review does not matter to me . this review is intended for your design department . thanks for the mirror
1	i am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years , i have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right ( or slice under pressure ) . i have tried the medicus , and still slice and other gizmos ( swing jacket ... .junk ) to no avail . the swing setter worked for me . it showed me a flaw in my grip ( by the way , this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others i routinely play with ) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane . i tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left ( still some over the top ) but getting better every day . i recommend combining this with the swing rite for a powerful swing . you will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you do n't look like a goof on the range . give it a try , it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me . good golfing
0	when i purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago , i had high hopes . my hands become cold easily , and i was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them . i will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal , unheated gloves . they are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity . however , the heating element is ineffective . inserting batteries into the gloves provided little ( if any ) increase in warmth . my fingers remained cold . in addition , i have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected . these gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse , so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily . if you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands ( including your fingers ) warm , look elsewhere
0	stay away from this prodcut . manual sucks ... and the product is horrible ... .there is no way this thing is going to work .
0	poor workmanship . padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5 '' long . most palms are wider than that . the cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use . shipping them back would cost more than they 're worth .
0	the gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people would not take it back - said he 'd had it too long . i will never buy this product , nor work with this seller again . horrible .
0	we bought two fannypacks , one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip . we were doing some shallow water snorkeling , no diving . my husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports . our stuff got soaked ! why our friends worked we and ours did n't is anybody 's guess , possibly ours had a defective seal . these fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and i know some of them do n't seal right !
1	they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well
1	bag is easy to carry and lightweight . it is good for carrying gym clothes to school . bag is somewhat hard to open
0	i ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations , but i expected it to project sound at least a short distance . when we tried it out all we got was feedback . words were not audible at all . when i contacted the seller i was told it was a novelty item only , which i think is a ridiculous answer , since even a novelty item should work a little ... maybe the one we got was broken . i did n't try again , since the seller did n't seem to think anything was wrong with it when i called , and the shipping , which was not refunded when i returned it , was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end
1	i bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it . it is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability . i think i may order one for myself
0	my little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday ( 8/28 ) and due to missing parts . i was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one . for the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted . we have been having to go and order parts for the bike . the bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out . the box that the bike came in was in horrible condition , it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year . then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape . there were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts . we were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me . i am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny .
0	purchased the 418 elliptical 5 months ago now . reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story . after 3 weeks the clicks , squeaks and clunks would n't go away by just tighting bolts so i called for service . it took 4 weeks to get a tech . to look at it , he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks . replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals . it 's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks . thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided , not so . the heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine , unlike many other reviewer 's comments
0	this is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs . it is fairly quiet , not silent . it is shakier than i had hoped . the wire to the monitor came broken .
1	this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft , it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps , the distance is much greater and the hop up , the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns . o yea make sure u buy extra clip
1	55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5 '' . so this works great for my wife but not for me . she is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this . this is an amazing anti-burst ball .
0	do n't buy this . it does n't work . the ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp . i 've attempted around 50 stamps ( on some range balls ) and not one is crisp and clear . the stamp is either running ( too much ink ) , or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink . save your money , buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that
0	do n't count on this compass or you will get lost . it is not the least bit accurate
1	gloves are toasty ... perform as expected , and are a sweet luxury after a long , cold day on the slopes ; however , the d-sized batteries ( 1 per glove ) are considerably more bulky than what i expected . most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries ... but no , just one , bit fat chicken-roastin ' d-sized battery . good product , but consider whether wearing the big ol ' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves , or whether you 'll barely notice , being bundled-up and bulkified anyway . may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out .
1	i worked with eureka to design this exclusive tent for amazon . ( note : i work at amazon and am biased ) , ... but want to share why we built this tent for amazon customers . eureka is one of the best names in the outdoors industry . their timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades . they have built on that innovation , and i believe build the best `` family camping tents '' in the business . this tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good-sized family : - spacious and big . it has a center height of 7 feet , and feels huge . it 's a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet . you can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably - easy assembly . shock-corded fiberglass poles and ring-and-pin systems make for an easy set-up with 2 folks . - quality . from seams that are sealed to high quality mesh . this tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons . as i re-read this review , i realize i have n't done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent . 7 foot center height is tremendous !
0	the reason i gave it one star is because of how it affected my body . i am an athletic person and very agile , but this is one of the workouts that i will never do again . i have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and i was in tears . i had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it . my knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and i could hardly walk . i 'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you , but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain , please stay away from the ball workout .
0	the set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load , but when used in a 2-in . hitch it wobbles like crazy ! i was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn . i had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right , but it 's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch .
1	great scope has good zoom and works good for 22. and super 9 air guns . note that its dovetail and not weaver though great scop
1	i was skeptical of buying this because i was n't sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class - i had been using a towel for a while but it was n't helping - this product is amazing and i do n't slide around at all anymore - i even bought one for my friend and she loves it too . i bought a yellow mat because i loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more - obviously it washes out but it 's visible during class . definitely worth the money !
1	well , i originally ordered the black utg black sniper rifle , but was out of stock at air-splat . well , i could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the green utg od green sniper rifle that i had been thinking about ahead of time . so i sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later . the screws , you get some screws , now on the newer versions , the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger , is not the long screw . you put in a short screw , well at least for me . i had tried to figure out what was wrong , finally decided to call them and they told me what to do . now to the gun- excelent . definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper . also , have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin . it will either bleed or nice a welt , and if thats cool with you , than by all means dont tell them untill its to late . the gun itself should only be used with .20g and up . anything less will ruin the gun . with .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda . the gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed . personally , i stay back and take head shots at the other team 's leaders and medics . with the bolt-action that you use , you can decide when you are going to relode . also , you should also get alot of white .20g . with white .20g , you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots . pros : very accurate very painful ( could be con , depends on how you look at it ) weighted well very intimidating looking cons : a bit heavy for long games ( but you should be moving anyways now should you ? ) if you dont sight your scope ( or dont even get one ) there are no aiming sights , it would be a bit wasy to miss
0	difficult to set up ! netting rips far too easily ... avoid this item ! be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough
1	i recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while . one of the suggestions i got was to get a gripmaster , and when i checked it out , i found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers . i ordered one , and i can definitely say it was a good investment ! there 's a big difference in my grip now - i can even crack a nut with one hand easily ( using a nutcracker of course ) . i ca n't wait to try the 7-lb one
0	what this is is a cheap skateboard , with a cheap metal bar stuck through it , with some dora stuff pasted on last minute . within the first day of using this , the dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard ( where your child puts their feet ) was torn . within two days , it was nearly completely destroyed . i tried to fix this with elmer 's glue , but to no avail . now i have a 'plain ' scooter ... i 've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot , it might be worth that price , but not any more..
0	the suction cups do not work on many toilet seats . though the idea is great , save your money unless you have some to burn
1	the bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models ( original , by schwinn ) that my husband has used consistently for 12 years . it came in one huge box , and took the two of us half a day to put together . the directions and diagrams were pretty clear . one piece was broken , but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete . they have changed the power-rod holder , so we ca n't salvage most of the old ones . my husband did figure out a way to position two 50-lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance . it is not as compact as the older model , but it does fold up somewhat . overall , he is very pleased with this purchase -- we paid less for this one through amazon than we did in 1995
0	not very bright for an led . and , guess what ? this is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it , one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something ... well , the spike is more like a thumbtack . i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer , so i do n't blame amazon - but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this .
1	i recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around italy . i 'm not a runner ( or a walker , or even mildly aerobic ) and i have baby-tender feet , so i was very concerned about blistering . on the advice of some runner-friends , i bought bodyglide and coated my feet with it every day before i put on my socks and shoes . my feet were tired and achy every night , but no blisters ! ! this is an amazing testament to the power of bodyglide because sometimes i can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal , low activity work-day , and i was walking for hours at a time over bricks , cobblestones , you-name-it . if you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to , buy a big , ol stick of bodyglide and coat your feet every day
0	the title pretty much says it all . the bag is solid and did n't get too soft even after a good amount of use . the big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and ca n't support the weight of the bag . one of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability . all within about six months of use . unless you 're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them i 'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag .
1	the item arrived in a timely manner and its a quality purchase . its keeps ice just like advertised . i am very satisafied with it . it has lots of room and is easy to carry with sturdy handles . lc
0	please do n't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy . it is tiny ! the `` hinges '' and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon . the `` jewels '' never sink , either . interestingly , pooltoy does n't list the size of this product . in fact they do n't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing . what a rip off . i hope amazon discontinues its association with this company . look at the feedback record for them . it 's as terrible as this toy is
1	i wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal ? i compared this in store to other products by thermos , no-names , etc , and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products i 've ever seen or used . i should have bought it years ago , and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches . and jeez , the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag , something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever ? i used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in two plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage . never again . this thing is solid . i must admit , it appeals to my guy side , ( see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner , below ) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts . i think i sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after i bought it . it looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents ' house , to which they would say , `` oh , that used to be your grandfather 's , and i used it too . it still works . '' they could call it the man-jar . ( ladies , do n't be afraid , the thermal properties are gender-blind , and green will be in this fall ) if you got dumped recently by your girlfriend ( or wife , or mom , or whatever ) , this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery . despite the fact that spending money is something i generally discourage , this jar will actually help you save money in the long run . you could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon . heck , my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload . technical stuff : i put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved ( prev . frozen ) vegetables into the container , with a thermometer . started at 180 deg . f , and arrived at 140 deg . f four hours later . i bought it before a 7-day road trip , living out of a cooler in the back of my car . i did n't eat a single crappy fast-food meal , and i did n't spend a dollar on anything but gas . * all healthy , pre-cooked , home-style , k-dog-style stuff . get yourself a corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover , and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop . i 've put boiling water in it , let it sit overnight , with the top off , and it was still warm in the morning . * and a hotel . and a speeding ticket . i musta been so excited to have this food bottle . damn ohio pigs
1	the clear instructions make this piece of exercise equipment easy to put together . it 's also very sturdy and offers a wide range of exercises
0	we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , with alot of different features , but we have n't been able to use it . it did n't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with ironman 's customer service department ever since . they keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we 're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day . well after 2 weeks , we 've had it ! we 're taking it back and never buying another ironman product again . they 're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they wo n't get anyone out there to fix it ? nothing against the store , they 've been great . just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer
1	i work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises . my dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy , so i looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room , and this rack was perfect . i did look at a number of racks both online and in rl , but the majority were way over my budget , had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio . i was just about ready to fabricate my own when i found this on amazon . after reading the reviews and crunching the numbers , i decided to give this a shot . i 'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems . *** this rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated ; with the use of a single crescent wrench , i put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so . well within 2 hours of opening the box , it was in place and holding weights . it is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material . the construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly . it ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices . *** the actual dimensions of this rack are 36.75 '' x 24 '' x 32 '' ( w x d x h ) . add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space ( for lifting the weights in and out ) . i have filled it 's available space with sets of 10-50 # dumbbells in 5 # increments . for the past month , it has held 540 # and remained absolutely rock solid . from the feel of the thing , it could hold easily twice this weight without issue . *** highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space .
0	i bought this model a year ago , and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months . just recently , the deck cracked again . of course the warrantly no longer applies . save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand .
1	i bought this for my 10 year old grandson . it is an unusual ride , took him a while to catch on , but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it
0	these clubs are a waste of money . the graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75 . my 8 iron broke the first time i hit it . the bag is falling apart . save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs . u can get some clone clubs that will last years and u 'll play twice as better for just a tad more
1	does the job . does not take up a lot of space . holds all my weights and is located for easy access during workouts . what more do you want
0	this radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker . the 1 bulb led flashlight is brighter than i thought it would be . the rubberized case is solid and durable . two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume . there are 3 big drawbacks . 1 . the tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read . 2 . the crank handle is the smallest i 've seen and feels like it will break easily . 3 . the worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight . it is a `` push '' round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up . they should have used a `` slide '' switch and put it in a different area
0	even though this is a receiver hitch mount item , it does not use a standard hitch pin . it is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch ( must be bolted into the hitch - to remove , must be unbolted ) . this totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility : the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch . bad thule ! bad
0	this piece is really quite over-priced for what you get , though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you . i 've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a `` travel-friendly '' swiss army tool ( not knife ) . nevertheless , the unit i have is the 64mb version of : asin : b0002vm8zm ... which costs considerably less ( ~ $ 30 ) on amazon , has the same 128mb usb drive and red light as the unit on this page , plus you get a small quantity of swiss army tools including a knife . unless you are concerned about going on a plane , i 'd recommend the asin : b0002vm8zm over the unit on this page . btw , i got my handy little 64mb unit ( which i 'd give four stars for if i had the option ) for only $ 9.99 on clearance at target .
0	does the unit work ? ? , ... well yes to a degree . it takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances . the display is poor and though they say `` up to 40 objects per hole '' there is normally 2-4 objects per hole . all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder . the user ( you ) can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder did n't think was important . now the bad part . the unit attaches via button and belt clip ( like a cell phone ) . my button ( part that attaches to main unit ) has died twice in the first 30 days . when it breaks again , ... which it will often , ..the unit will probally hit the dirt . this is n't good . but fear not . it will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with skygolf . and another week to get a replacement button ( which has been modified even weaker than the original one ) . now my replacement broke on the first time i clipped it to the belt . now back to skycaddie to get another . after being on hold for another hour , they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts . this will take another hour . you then get a message to leave a message . normally within a week someone will call you back . by normally i mean about 35 % of the time you leave messages they return them . would i buy another , ... duh , ... . no
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
0	initially , the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate . it did , however , give my wife a good laugh ; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps ' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote . but after one week of use , the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick . pass on this one
0	like most weight loss product these were a wate of money.on the plus side they did a fair job a suppressing my appitite but i did not lose even an ounce.no side effects either no head aches or shakes .
0	i walk pretty much the same distance daily , and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route . i could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride , etc . but off by thousands of steps ? hardly worth it
0	i was surprised by what i got . this flashlight is not bright at all . especially when used as a lantern . i could hardly see the other side of my living room .
1	this is a excellent product for certain needs . it is unmatched for ease of transport ( i can easily carry four of them at once ) . the only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold . this makes perfect sense , of course . if they were sturdier , they would be heavier . a common sense approach to usage -- place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge -- will insure safety and longevity of the product . all in all , a very good value
1	similar to other reviewers , i was looking for a bench that i could do both abdominal and lower back work . this was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range . the construction is nice and sturdy , the assembly was no problem , and overall i 'm very pleased . the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth . i wish the main section were a foot longer , which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work . although i do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls - i would n't have known to do that if it were n't for the photo on this site . bottom line : good value for a versatile bench
0	well all i can say is do n't buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun
1	i have this for a month now . it has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock . in addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under $ 5 in a sports store . pretty happy with it
1	this was the hit of christmas eve . i gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one . it projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening . great product . i am ordering several more
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading : 1 . `` usually ships in 24 hours '' . it actually took 1 week to ship it . 2 . when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have `` leather band '' . the band was made of artificial materials ( nylon and rubber ) or something like that . i will have to return it
1	i bought this stroller to replace my combi-ithru , but found that i needed to keep it . although this schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back . the recline position is a bit to far back for `` mall strolling '' making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby . aside from that , the schwinn handles tough terrain like a mercedes benz or cadillac . its great ! baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller . it has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements . it steers like a dream ! grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime . no extra effort needed . the big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby . my daughter is 13 months old , 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into . the stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable . the only thing i do n't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby , the reason why i kept my combi i-thru . aside from that , i recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain ! this one can handle it all . happy strolling .
0	the description doesnt mention it , but the weights are sand filled bags . when using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable .
0	this stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use ; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down , or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done . do n't know if it 's really misbehaving or it 's just on some obscure other function when i think i set it for countdown ... ? operating manual is available online pdf , and it 's several pages long
0	i got this because it was cheap , but since it does n't work and i have to get another , i did n't really save any money . the lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing . it 's completely fake : nothing inside moves when you move it , and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve . it 's just something you can play with while you 're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you . i did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire . with a flat tire , i could n't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in .
0	we bought and then returned the scuttle bug . it was well made and easy to snap together . however , it was far , far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite ( only 25 percentile for height and weight ) . her knees dragged the ground . i think it is a cool product , but maybe for younger/smaller children . we wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic ! !
0	i was promised 1-2 day shipping and did n't get it . i was promised reciept by dec. 6th and have n't gotten it
0	i have used pedometers for a few years . i was initially impressed with this pedometer but then i discovered the 360 i received did not always 'wake ' and keep track of steps . the 360 i received did not always count steps even when already 'awake . ' the 'sleep ' 'wake ' feature is bogus , it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser . i would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep . heartrate monitors , the company i bought it from was not responsive when i asked for guidance . i bought another pedometer from a different dealer , the sportline 345 - it 's my second 345 , need i say more
0	uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors . as mentioned , the mirrors are of a terrible quality . to top that , they do not stay in place when adjusted
0	i bought this pedometer for myself , and bought my wife a $ 20 omron pedometer , and hers ' is far superior . easier to set up , more accurate , durable . lesson : spend a few dollars more for something that works well . this one is disposable junk
1	sometimes this unit works flawlessly , other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal . i am not sure if that is a problem with this usb device , the polar hrm , or the way that i am holding it . in any event , most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly .
0	i bought this to replace a c-strobe light i used as a tail-light on my bicycle . the c-strobe was bright , flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain , and waterproof , just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack . this one was by the same manufacturer with `` strobe action '' and 1/3 the cost . it does n't flash , the `` strobe action '' is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light . it is n't anywhere near as bright as the c-strobe . i 'm going to get a c-strobe later this month from a local boating dealer
0	i just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym . i now have painful calluses in my palm . the glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting . apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand
1	this is a beautiful , slim , sharp , functional , fast knife . the knife is slim , and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket . the safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff , but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off . the pocket clip is reversible , allowing you to carry the knife point up . this is a great feature , because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up , you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening . the knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion . the speed-safe index opening flipper works very well , opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism . no grand flourishes , thumb strength , or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife . the finish is good , the quality is great , everything about this knife is amazing . a great knife to own .
1	i 've had this backpack for about 5 months now , and i still have a great opinion of it . it holds many books and folders ... it can also accomodate my inspiron laptop with a 15.4 '' screen . the backpack does n't have an included laptop sleeve , so i found a solution by buying the sumdex padded large laptop sleeve , which is n't very expensive , but very protective and a perfect fit , and just putting the laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack . even after doing so , i still had room for a couple of books . keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack , slightly bulky , so if you are n't in need of something with such a high capacity , then this might not be the backpack for you . the backpack does n't have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils , pens , etc ... it just has a few smaller zippered openings . if you have a lot of stuff in them , you will be having to fumble around your things . i did n't find this too troublesome overall , though . the backpack is comfortable , and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books , etc ... i am happy with my purchase , as i always have been with jansport purchases
1	this stuff is excellent , it goes on easy like a roll on and lasts the whole run whether it be 30 minutes or 6 hours , even with a complete sweat . i would recommend this product to all short and long distance runners .
1	i 'm a small person at 5'2 '' , so this 24 '' denali is perfect for me . i bought the 26 '' one and liked it , but it was too big , so gave that one to my husband . the bike was easy to assemble , no problems with delivery , very quickly . i like the way the denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike . it shifts smoothly rides very nice , this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it !
1	works real well for leg exercises , but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards
0	i just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today . i brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews . when i read that people are losing this thing all the time , i could believe it ! lol i 'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it . :
0	i just bought this through amazon and then put it together pretty quickly . packaging was lousy , as others have already mentioned , and 3 pieces were either missing or broken , so i had to call for them . first customer service rep was ok , but the next day i found the pedal crank making a sound , and called back , but the next rep claimed that i put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears . i held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it , and he acknowledged hearing the noise , but said i would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own . the unit came w/ that part already sealed , so i do n't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product . although the product appears to be engineered well , any company that 's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating
0	the snap on the leapers `` elite '' drop leg holster ( the term elite must be used loosely ) would never stay attached . it would always either unsnap or come loose at the back . eventually it fell off in the field and i lost it . the straps would never stay securely in the place i positioned them . the leapers deluxe drop leg holster is much more effective . even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place . the method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well . spend a few more dollars for the deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the elite
1	as a man with nearly flat feet , this product has saved my legs . while the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class , what seperates it that sof sole 's customer service is outstanding and the warranty holds true . when they wear out within a year , simply send them back and you 'll get a new pair . you 'll be purchasing several pair , feel great and wonder why you didn ' do it sooner . i 've owned sof sole insoles for 7 years and i 'll have them for 7 more .
1	the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey..ive used it since it first came out and i love it..strings break a lot it seems like..i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque
1	overall , i 'm very happy with this mat . at first , i was n't sure i was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two . i also , initially , did n't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it would n't lay flat but i solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over .
0	this bobber cooler is definitely a conversation piece . i have had so many comments about it . i used it when floating down a small river near home ( no rapids , just calm water ) , it does n't hold its weight , literally . the first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler , making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water . the opening seam rides just barely about the water , and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water . the cooler then fills up with water , which almost immediatly melts the ice , and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom . maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better , it might be ok . the 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off , plus they are facing the wrong direction . if you bump something like a rock or a log , it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler . this cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current , like a pool , but i do n't suggest towing it behind anything . i suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market
1	i bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours . my girlfriend unwrapped the box on christmas day , and filled it that afternoon . it had ice still 2 days later . sturdy , effective , and comfortable to drink from . i 'm going to buy myself one too .
1	this is the same system released 4+ years ago . ( this is the fanny lifter-not the box and not the transfirmer-the wider steps . ) i was very out of shape-could n't make it up stairs without being out of breath . it was very tough starting up ... i could n't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout . i went from a size 16 to a size 6 . because of this system i have fallen in love with exercise and feeling/looking great ! allie , lisa and jen are great leads
0	the band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use , i did n't even had the chance to kick with it ; i excepted better quality from everlast ; too bad in addition , the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin
1	i purchased this bike for my wife it is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy , easy to assemble ( as long as your a little mechanically inclined ) . its true if your less than 5'2 '' you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals im 6'2 '' and there is still room to move the seat back . product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape . my folks purchased a bike for $ 1200 yes it is nicer ( the preset programs and overall looks ) but not by much . i would buy this again if i needed to . negatives- screen hard to read for shorter people . and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet .
1	we have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons ; 1 was a gift , but the other 2 are kept at our home as i watch the boys daily . the boys , ages 20 months and 3 yrs , love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing . i love them because of the way they are built . the center of gravity is set very low to the ground , making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past . the rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too . ( i had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys . ) the old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off . all in all , a great trike
1	we just got it , i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine , and i let it sit for a day and a half . it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time . shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long . we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight . this works perfectly .
0	i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services . i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase . ( mine in three months . ) the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself . ( in one occasion , they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it 's good . ) these back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months , and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you , even though it 's still within one year . i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise , not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying : `` this is our policy .
1	i bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers . having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year , i decided to go with something tried and true . and while you ca n't set it up to turn on by itself , i will never have to replace it again . the color is beautiful . it is a snap to clean up ( just throw it in the dishwasher ) . and , the coffee tastes so much better . i now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful , robust coffee and no bitterness . i guess this is one thing that modern technology ca n't top . i will never go back to and electric coffee maker
1	i am the leader of a team called point 0 i got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks . it shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more . the scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night . it holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top . but do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping . i am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks
0	i am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me , it says that its adujustable , but it can only be made shorter and not longer . for a kid this is a good jump rope , but its definitely not for a tall person
0	most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks i talked to dislike this product . i 've used it a number of times myself and i would never use it again ( especially after i discovered better products ) . it turns your chain and drive train into a black mess . finish line was better . triflow was recommended by a number of cyclists .
1	i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears . i took these to a water park and they worked perfect . they are very soft and wont make your ear sore
0	i already have a good quality fitball stability ball that i really like and only bought this set to get the dvd . i had planned to give the ball to a family member , but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant , so it will probably just get thrown out . the included pump is a piece of junk , so even if you do want to use the low quality ball , you 'll need to find another way to inflate it . finally , mindy mylrea is a good instructor , but the music sound quality were lacking and i ended up not liking the workout , so in the end i got rid of the dvd as well .
0	when i received the flashlight it was broken i have tried to contact mark golden in delray , florida , the place the flashlight was sent from , and have heard nothing back this week
1	i love this watch ! it 's easy to use . it 's also a very basic watch . it gives your heart rate , zone and calories burned . it 's very nice for what it is supposed to do . if you 're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles , this is not the one for you . it looks nice and it 's not too bulky . the only reason i would have gotten the f6 is because it says it has something that prevents `` cross talk '' ( interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch . there are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we 've never had a problem with `` cross talk . '' as the other reviews said , there is no backlight . would recommend
0	i tried to use this thing , but it just goes off no matter what - even when nothing has moved . waste of money
1	just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good ! i use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while i watch the news . needed a chair like this because i 'm starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight . i hate exercizing and definitely do n't have the will/motivation to go to the gym consistently . i bought the ultra version because i needed to be able to hide it away when it is n't being used . once folded up ( 4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long ) it fits very nicely under my couch . it is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars . there are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked , 2 curved handle bars need to be removed ( simple twist knobs ) , and one stabilizer bar undone ( simple twist knob ) to fold this unit down . removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes . not difficult just wish it was easier . overall , i would definitely make this purchase again knowing what i now know .
0	i wish i could write a review of this product , unfortunately i can not because the vendor ( verdent ) is dishonest . you see amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days . verdent gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail , not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of bs on top of that . yes , i called the vendor and he told me quote `` we are having a difficult time getting ups to pick up our orders '' , what a crock unless you are't paying your ups shipping bills . anyway , to make a long story short , amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get verdent gifts to make the refund , verdent refused , so amazon is picking up the tab ... and hopefully giving the boot to verdent gifts in the process . avoid a headache and hassle , steer clear of these bums ( verdent gifts ) and thier dishonest practices
0	1 . calories shown during a workout are about 1.5 to 2 times actual . i do have the right weight entered in my user profile . 2 . machine broke right after warranty ran out . no manual . no reasonable support . i paid $ 850 , including shipping . it is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly . nothing about fixing this is intuitive . some of the nuts and screws are so tightly put on , you can not budge them . i am going to throw this junk out and buy a non-schwinn elliptical that has a better warranty and real servicabilty . customer support at 1-800-864-1270 is practically useless . save you rmoney . buy something else
0	the present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use . the newest presentation has solved this problem
1	i bought this mat for my exercise bike . it was large and gave my floor great protection . i would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment
1	this was such an unusual and unique idea . i gave it as a gift , and the person really liked it ! it 's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters . the artist who made this was very creative
0	package missing . it 's never be received . so i can not rate it
1	first i want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer 's text : the size/weight of the gloves does n't change according to the size of your hand but , rather , to the size of you , the user of the gloves . if you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves : nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up . hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves . women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are . the point with heavier/bigger gloves is to protect your training partner . anyway , on with the review : these are good , all-around sparring gloves . their over-all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner 's neck and shoulders when clinching . however , i found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they 're not the safest gloves around . still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who 's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring . i recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which , again , makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring . remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle , wrist , and shoulder injuries . everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products . these gloves do what they are supposed to do
0	i should have read the previous review before ordering , because this product did not work at all . the on/off button did not work/click . the light produced a very faint light , less than a cell phone emits . do n't buy this product ; there are better flashlights out there
0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall ... .it crashed down . the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless . a waste of over three hundred dollars
1	for some reason the electronic control panel does n't work on my bike . but i do n't mind too much . the bike is small and light but has enough mass so it does n't slide around . i use the bike while doing work , watching tv or reading . it 's a great way to get exercise on rainy days
0	this cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline ; but every single time it rains , i have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle ! it is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly . more damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it ! this is a worthless item
1	the gym is very easy to assemble , took me about 45 minutes on my own . the book supplies several different workouts , hitting every major muscle group , and you get good resistance in every workout . you wo n't get great range of motion on all the workouts , there may be times when you 'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch , but those are minor adjustments you 'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment . the gym itself is light , easy to move around the house , and does n't take up much space . it may be too light , and not sturdy enough in some instances , and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts . the price is outstanding , at 180 dollars . you 're not going to find a better deal than this , and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive bowflex
0	it has n't broken yet , but it is going to eventually . i 'm 5'10 '' 180lbs and these things barely support me and do n't provide a stable grip . these would be fine for a smaller woman , but thats really it- the pvc construction is n't adequate , i thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken
0	i was so frustrated with those so called `` sticky mats '' , my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog . so i decided to give the $ 50 skidless yoga towel a try . this worked pretty well for my slipping hands , but i had a new problem . i was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga . ( downward facing dog , even poses like triangle and extended side angle ) . i really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat ( those rubber mats ) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences . i would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat , maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel . i realized with yoga mats that every person is different , so what does n't work for me , may work for you . i just thought i would give my 2 cents
1	dear amazon , my new royal blue armour duffle bag is the best travel bag i have ever owned . it is durable beyond anything i have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black . i actually ordered a small royal blue carry-on duffle directly from under armour so the two match and i am utterly pleased . under armour is definitely a keeper ! ! ! ! ! andrew gonzale
1	the izzo swing/grip trainer has worked wonders for my swing and grip . the grip form helps train your arm to keep the face of the club straight . it also helps to build muscle where you need it for a more powerful golf swing
0	while this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min , the second time i tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min . even after getting new batteries ( which turned out not to be the problem ) i tried to get the belt to work like before but realized i was `` scammed '' . it is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones
0	this pillow is too small and it is not comfortable at all
0	do n't buy this compass if you need to know any direction . if you know about where the sun sets , you will be more accurate than this `` compass . '' it is impossible to use in the field . a waste of money : inaccurate to the max , impossible to maintain it level , etc . just junk . they should give them away
1	i am very pleased with knife 's . the vender was great . i ordered them and in 3 days i had them . thank you all . ts
0	these gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they 're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand . in addition , the padding is very thin . i would n't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer . they 're probably fine for the speed bag . if you 're going to use these gloves , at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or , like me , you 'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles . for not very much more money , you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection
1	... and i wanted to pump it up . i have a bicycle pump in the garage , but no adapter for the ball . i figured that , at the price of this item , i had little to lose and much to gain . i got what i wanted , for less than 10 bucks delivered . i 'm quite satisfied
1	with the birth of our first child , there were tons of little toys lying around all the time , from teethers to rattles , stuffed lovies and blocks . the traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space , so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside , how sturdy it was , and how much our baby loved looking at it ! with bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin , there is even a fold out flap with a play space , and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket . the fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble `` shingles . '' this was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips . best of all , there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside ! it is soft and collapsible , yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys . it can be very gently machine washed , but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy . i gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby 's toys . i give this 5 stars without hesitation ; affordable and totally functional
1	msr 's pocket rocket is a great little cooker . best for going light and fast . perfect as a shared stove among two people , and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water . i would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters , more than this and it becomes a little unstable . if your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you . because this is a stove designed for the minimalist , it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot , so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread . again , great for boiling water and melting snow , but not for actual cooking
1	we got this as a family gift for christmas . we love the red color , and it 's great to have out at most holidays . the kids were so excited to roll it around , and hear the ice inside . they did n't believe it at first that it was really making ice cream . the anticipation drove them crazy . but it was fun for everyone . i fully recommend this product . we are a family of 4 with the mega ball . at first i was n't sure if it would be enough , but we even had leftovers . and i love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors . i would give it 10 stars if i could
0	when i ordered the product , i kept putting on my order for a medium size . when the final paperwork was sent for delivery , it said it was being shipped and it was a small . a small was sent , instead of a med. , therefore we could not use the product . if you can take care of this matter , with a return ticket for the small one , we would appreciate it
1	assembles easily and does n't take up much space . the quality is good , but i do n't think it 's strong enough for heavy use . it 's great for small workouts in front of the tv , though .
1	treadmill sets up fairly quickly , unless you are a moron , then it might take you some time . the pistons are stiffer than i thought they would be , allowing for a very challenging upper body workout . i usually row while i am watching tv or a game , and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise - it really is very quiet . unless you are looking for a health club quality rower , this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone
0	the turnaround to receive the product is horrible ! product was ordered before christmas and was n't received until end of january
1	this is a great bike . i gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for christmas . it is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time . my son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard . this bike is made so the turning radius is very small . the bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn . no problem . he goes sailing through the house now with no crashing . once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball . he will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance . he should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether . my short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor . in a few months she should be fine and i 'm guessing by this summer she 'll be sailing on it . great fun . unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow . i found one on sale through a design website so i could manage it . if the money wo n't bankrupt your budget or you can save for it , it 's worth it
1	excellent quality ; much easier to put on than the cap i used before
1	i have been very happy with the hang-ups and have used them for the last month . i have not had any issues and they look to be built very well
0	i give it two stars for the snorkel , the mask and the fins are just junk ! ! the mask : the mask is a purge mask ... meaning it has a small disk that , in theory , lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing . the problem is this , any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask . and if you happen to suck in via your nose you 'll definately get a mask full of water . the fins : the 're a strap type fin which is good but they are so tight you ca n't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you 're walking over coral , rocks or any other sharp objects . the biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming . this set was for my wife and hers came off i did n't think to much of it until mine did too . you might say , buy smaller fins but they run in a size x to size x so you ca n't buy any smaller . the snorkel is ok , it 's a little short but it works
1	wow this scope goes great with the utg master sniper . it works very well when you tune it in
1	these ropes are great for double dutch . they 're very fast and long so you can do two people at a time . i love double dutch . it is a lot easier with these ropes
0	this boat seemed like a great idea , and my 7 month baby does like it . it gets him in the water , which is fun , but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second . he has fallen over the sides , he has fallen forward between the seat and tube . the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube . my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening . this boat is dangerous . i am looking for a new one
1	i wanted a simple , portable way to enjoy moving my body more . this is it . i just hop on it during commercials or when i need to get up and move from my desk . it works .
1	the firm just keeps getting better and better ! they 're products are wonderful ! i 've been using the firm videos for a looooong time and i love them ! ! the cardio-weight training does wonders for your body ! now with the transfirmer system , this is definitely a challenging workout - even for me and i 've been an advanced exerciser for over 20 years . i love the incline step ... you can really feel the difference . you can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well . it gives you great variety with the height of the step , weights , incline , etc . this is an awesome workout ... i love every dvd ! ! very challenging and i 'm am very happy i bought this . the step is wonderful and very sturdy ! this is the only step you 'll ever need ... for all your firm workouts !
0	after ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart . the brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase . while ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride . with out a seat i had to walk the bike back to the car . i advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working .
0	it really deserves a 0 rating -- non- skid surface is a joke -- it is slick as glass -- tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg -- golden slipped off side and hurt her leg -- learn from my mistake -- there is nothing positive to say about this product
0	i hate to rate this item poorly but it did n't work well for me . i installed it in my basement . it 's hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor , everytime i hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down . solid product for the right location .
0	we recieved two of these for my daughter 's first birthday . she loves being in the pool but this float almost changed everything ! ! ! ! the inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up . my daughter freaked out ! ! ! ! she had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this . do not waste your money
0	no where does amazon say in their description , that this comes completely disassembled ! i have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer . so here it sits in it 's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor . amazon is not paying for return shipping and i can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it . buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy . this may be a good machine , but i will never find out .
0	i bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use , making them completely unusable .
0	my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i do n't know which one to get her . the airzone 8 ' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13 ' trampoline which got terrible reviews . i do n't know what to believe . can anybody help
0	have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed . if you move the compass ( of your own choice or it falls off the windshield ) , you need to recalibrate it . i 've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10º swing of direction . i have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness
1	i take a ringside boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them . i ordered them from online because it was the only place i could find a size small . i am very happy with them . they offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers . i really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist . they do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them , but it washes right off . the only thing bad i have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them , the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger . it can be sewed up , but you should n't have to do that so soon after the purchase . no one else in my class seems to have had this problem . i still gave them 4 stars , because i have a hunch that the threading is n't a common problem and i love them otherwise
1	i recall first hearing about bag balm at an adult scout leader training retreat . one of the participants started talking about bag balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm . needless to say , i was intrigued and , upon returning from the retreat , did a little more investigating . when i asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using bag balm under a doctor 's direction for pesky diaper rash . i then began to question some of my horse riding buddies . they too had heard of it and used it with very positive results . i immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm . i could n't be more pleased . i have used bag balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well . rubbed directly into the skin . under band-aids . you name it . the stuff , as originally touted by my scouting friend , seems also to have antibacterial properties . now , i am not a doctor and i do n't play one on tv so please do n't take that as some sort of prescription . putting it in a nutshell , bag balm is incredible stuff and it works . i highly recommend it ! the horsema
1	i 'm pregnant and this bolster has saved my life . it 's great for meditation and to place btw . my knees while i sleep .
1	this litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions . it 's collapsable , strong , light and easy to use . i wish the price was under $ [ ... ] , but the best price i could find was on amazon.com and it 's what my wife wanted and loves . we also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly . a good product ! !
0	i wish i 'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it . i had the same problem many other reviewers here had : after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks , the cable snapped , rendering it useless . this is just a poor quality machine , plain and simple
0	brutal , horrible instructions ! no pictures ! no clear , concise steps to follow . it took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned , nothing fits properly . it 's very flimsy and unsteady . i was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so i returned it . do n't waste your time and money . spend a little more and get a better product .
1	this door gym is incredible . i have been getting great workouts with this . my arms , chest , back , and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week . great workout . throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer
1	if you are a power lifter and often tear your skin with regular lifting gloves , then these are for you . they offer the most support in the areas that i need it , then any other glove i 've tried . a++
0	as the previous reviewer said , i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper . but do n't make a mistake , it 's impossible to correct . if it is possible , i do n't know how as there are no directions . using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical . with the buttons the way they are , its going to get bumped and errors made . and you probably wo n't even know it . just a horrible design and a waste of money
1	if you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this . even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on .
1	we did n't know what to expect for the good price . but what a surprise this thing is built very sturdy . extremely easy to set up , maybe took 2 minutes . it is very very quiet . extremely happy with purchase .
1	i bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in colorado - i recently went in january and it worked nearly perfect ! every location i could find an elevation marker , the watch was within 10 feet . the thermometer works well also , it just can not be on your wrist to read the temp correctly . the watch looks great , i wear it to work nearly every day . i would highly recommend it
1	short review : this combo is an exceptional deal . for the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool . alone the swiss army tool is over $ 30-35 bucks
1	this item shipped very fast . the sandal was true to size and color . i am very satisfied with my purchase
1	i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w/e u cock the gun with to shoot ? ? ? ? i dont wan na break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it
1	i purchased this knife for about $ 4 cheaper than its usual amazon listing price at amazon 's friday sale . i had been looking at the kershaw knives for awhile , and following an incident in my building 's parking garage ( woman accosted , pocketbook stolen ) , it seemed like the perfect time to buy . the `` rainbow '' titanium-coating color might bother some men , but i 'm a woman , so i do n't mind the color of the knife . i would have preferred the black-on-black , but this was too good a deal to pass up . the safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily , but in two weeks time of regular wear/use , i have n't had a problem . i flip the knife open often ( heck , it 's fun ) , and i wear it regularly ( what 's the point of having it , if you 're not prepared to use it ? ) . the thin attached metal `` belt clip '' is very sturdy and multipurpose ( it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen ) . not only can i clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband , but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse . the single finger flip-open mechanism is beyond belief - very easy to use , exceptionally fast and accurate . the locking mechanism ( keeps the blade in place ) is extremely solid , and has worked without flaw . when i 'm walking anyplace suspicious by myself , i hold the knife in the `` ready to flip open '' position in my hand , held down at my side . the knife is nearly invisible in that position , so i do n't stand out as `` oh my god , she 's carrying a knife ! '' however , someone intent on a criminal act just might notice , and avoid me altogether . great knife for personal safety . lastly , like the other reviews point out , these knives are sharp . i do n't use mine to open letters , boxes and typical pocket knife activities ( i believe that would gum it up , and slow the opening speed of the knife ) , so i anticipate the blade should have a good , long life in my care .
0	i am writing this as a review of hippo clubs in general . i purchased a simmilar set from amazon a year ago because it was a $ 300 set or irons reduced to $ 100 . i was interested in the graphite shafts ( all i have ever used is steel ) and wanted a cheap set to travel with ( i have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel ) . the first thing that i noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically . the clubs looked nice enough , but their performance was less than par . when i talked with my club pro , he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant . your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $ 80 each . he also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs ( which was a humbling fact that i had to swallow ) , and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts . all of this being said , i chalked up my $ 100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs . after 2 weeks , i found a hardly used set of '04 big berthas for $ 359 . i talked the salesman down to $ 299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that i have ever hit . i guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs , you are either a new or relatively unskilled player -- like me . if this is the case , take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter . let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $ 600- $ 1000 for new sets . take advantage of their trade-ins . that 's my opinion anyway
0	the jacket works well for shedding water which is n't really losing positive weight . the pants rip during the first work out . i 've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woould n't rip . but they did . save your money unless you just want to jacket .
1	difficult to put together with just one person , though not impossible . seems better for a child under 3 feet tall , though my daughter and i are making do . she loves it
0	i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one . im not buyin a swiss air mattress agai
1	attractive wood finish as seen in the picture . it was fairly easy to put together . keeps the golf stuff neat and organized .
0	this is the first product i 've bought through amazon that i wish i could give a negative star rating . after involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting , i 've concluded this product **** does not *** work . customer service cites this is a `` product upgrade '' . a video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit . what we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle . it would barely even unwrap . imagine derek jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade .
0	im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with , and found these . i probably just expected too much out of them , being about $ 8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much . well , me and a friend began shooting at each other , and the bbs curved largely to the left . not just a little , but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left . they 're really light ( although expected with cheap guns ) and have a really clumsy feel . they at least look kind of neat , and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator ( looks only ) . i later bought a $ 30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far , and shoots straight . these are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns . dont expect to win with these , unless you 're fighting other people with the same thing . and on another note , my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off . he wasnt pressing hard , it was just weak defective plastic .
1	while i live and run in what i consider a `` safe '' neighborhood , i feel just a little safer having this baby on my hand just in case and especially when it 's still dark in the mornings . i also carry it when i 'm walking my dogs in the afternoon
0	bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage , thought it 'd last until the end of the semester . after less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage , punctures started to appear , and the patches that came along with the package did n't help much . even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus , the quality is very disappointing
0	i bought this seat for $ 40 on sale at toys-r-us , since it stated it would fit `` most '' bikes . i followed the directions that came with the seat , and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that i tried it on . after several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike ( 5 hours total ) , i finally had this piece of crap installed , only to find out that both my and my wife 's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat . do not buy this piece of crap , it is not worth any amount of money as far as i 'm concerne
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since . we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way , and she just would n't part with it . my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night . ( almost 22 months old ) . i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby , but the prices people are asking here are outrageous
0	you ca n't play with this cards , all are marked and cuted ... do n't buy this cards .
1	make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this . i like using it when i 'm at home and do n't feel like going to the gym . i cardio , ( running or something ) afterwards . it 's really effective if your form is correct .
1	let me start saying that this is a wonderful product . small , light , and well constructed ( they feel like they will last forever ) . you can carry them with you , allowing to workout your fingers at the office , at home or wherever you find suitable . i bought the four different color-coded gripmasters : black/heavy , red/medium , blue/light , and yellow/extra light . i only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me , but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones . it was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price . the product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises : - trigger pinch . this one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger , and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination . - gross grasp . this one strengthens fingers , thumb , wrist and forearm for a firm grip . - hook position . this one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance . - tip to tip pinch . this exercise strengthens specific fingers , thumb , smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance . - wrist flexion . it strengthens wrist and forearm muscles . - key pinch . strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination . at the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports . if you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you , but if you need finger strength , control , endurance and coordination you are in the right place
0	i am not very happy with my new pedometer . it falls off all the time , the face plate comes off and i have a very hard time making it stay back on . the spring has now broke from the clip , so the pedometer wo n't even clip to my pants anymore . i have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that . i am disappointed with this purchase
1	its weighted and feels quite real . it only holds 40 bbs , unlike said in the product review . buy a bunch of these at the same time , because this company has outrageous shipping charges . i recommend taping two together ( facing different directions ) to reduce reloading time in a match
1	i 'd do business with these guys again . the shipment made it on time and was just as i expected . the only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when i opened the box
1	the bar itself is exactly what i wanted . the only reason i 'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles i had on the purchase . the bar arrived literally hanging out of the box , the box was really , really torn up . the collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar , needless to say the bar was useless untill i finally found some collars on ebay . amazon refunded all my $ $ as soon as they were aware of the problem . overall the bar is great
1	while there are those who will deride this product as an `` air matress with sides '' it is really a lot of versitile fun for the dollar . it gets you on the water cheaply and efficiently . it packs down small . i 've had mine for the past three years , and have taken it on all sorts of water , from calm ponds to pretty big waves in rivers with fairly strong current . i 've never had a problem . it holds me and my now 6 year old daughter perfectly . it replaced my old canoe and it has the following advantages : 1 ) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan 2 ) i do n't have to worry about the boat flying off the top of my car on the freeway 3 ) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan . it is seaworthy - i have even taken it out on lake superior ( on a very calm day ) and on day paddles into the boundary waters canoe area wilderness . i love it .
0	not very bright for an led . and , guess what ? this is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it , one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something ... well , the spike is more like a thumbtack . i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer , so i do n't blame amazon - but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this .
0	the product that was delivered was defective . the harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing . i contacted lafuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem . they sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-april when the new model comes out . the manufacturer was responsive ; however , i was out of pocket $ 13.00 for a shipping box that i purchased for the mailing . in fairness , amazon should reimburse me for this $ 13.00 expense . i did not expect to receive a defective product
1	i use this mat for yoga , martial arts , and many other exersizes . it is very soft/comfortable plus it has a cool look . it seems to be very durable and does n't slip even when i am sweating bullets . i believe it is definatly worth the money i spent . this is the best mat i have ever had ! !
1	this scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier . it also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake . it can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold . she is 10 and got it for her birthday
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here . these are great for hitting the heavy bag , speed bags , focus mitts , etc . the length of these , 108 '' , makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves . the 170-180 '' are for sparring and competitive bouts . that is why ringside makes different lengths . there is also a 120 '' length , which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps
1	smooth and easy to use . also , easy to run on . not quite as portable as i thought it would be , but to have a quality machine i guess it needs to be a little on the large size .
1	this is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging . i really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability . it comes with cup holders , which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory . overall it is a good stroller , the only thing that i would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature . it has 2 individual locks , one for each wheel . the jogger i had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed . i am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which i purchased it
1	the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size . but the blue cover for the edge which is round i will rate it a 1 is very poor for the price paid for . yes , it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on .
1	this is exactly what i wanted ! i 've had so many slipping problems in my ashtanga yoga class . both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses . here is the answer ! it works great ! i 'm very happy .
1	stamina ab /hyper bench has sturdy construction . it is well built for home gym .
0	the item was broken when i received it . also , it is not what the picture looked liked . very poorly made
1	i got this accessory with my door gym and i like it . but , when they say this is an `` efficient '' accessory - they mean it . it simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the door gym . the door gym has multiple grip areas , but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups . the broad reach bar is wide with downward grips ( like lat pull down bar in a gym ) . anyway , this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it wo n't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts . it has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the door gym posts . it will not roll easily , but it does a little . i think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it . do not give it to kids younger than about 15 ( in my estimation ) because some of them are too likely to play with , or misuse , it and get hurt . even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do , i deducted a point in the rating because i do n't think they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not
1	i use the ir interface with the polar s625x running computer , and i have never encountered a single problem . i usually use the interface in to different computers , a notebook at home ( with xp ) , and a desktop at work ( 2000 ) , and in both computers it works nicely . you have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the ir interface . install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer . i love my polar watch , and the ir interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product .
1	my kids and i have several backpacking stoves - and we are currently only using the brunton crux ... all the others have been mothballed . the brunton is well made and very reliable . it 's lightweight and very efficient . we are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister
0	terrible as a musical toy . my daughter liked the colors , but that was pretty much it . it is difficult to squeeze the feet too . cute as a stuffed animal
1	this is a quite good item . i looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye . it certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar ( mine is actually from a different maker , but of the same style ) much easier . my only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic . also , it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle . you can fill over it i suppose , but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle . i also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time , but that is a general issue with the bottles , not this lid . but overall , a very useful purchase
0	i bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs . those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online . they are n't that comfortable while plug into the ears , the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard .
1	this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition . all metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal
0	when the grill arrived , my husband put it together right away . i am glad he did . it was very unstable . i would be afraid of cooking anything on it . we packaged it back up and sent it right back
0	i rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid 's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike . i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child 's bike straight , but i never recived the part . i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they did n't help me . i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs . thank you
0	these are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb '
0	i found the size range to be completely missleading . my child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs . she is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat . her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable . the bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be
0	well ... the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good . i dry-shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas.i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some . its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen ! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank ! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games . 1.5 out of 5
1	this is an easy rack to use . it is quick to load bikes too . qualty seems very good . i use it also on the floor of my garage to hold the bikes during storage . i 'm very happy with this product . mik
0	this stepper is terrible ! the bar between the steps cracked after only two months of regular use . in addition , it is very squeaky and the monitor does n't register anything unless you step all the way to the ground . do n't waste your money on this piece of junk .
0	the scooter came with broken brakes . after numerous phone calls to razor , they sent the wrong part . they dont answer their phones during their open hours and the customer service is a slap in the face . buy another brand !
1	it 's ok . the bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions . good sturdy machine . a bit pricey
0	i ordered this item , thinking it was a pair . when i received it and realized my error , i ordered another of the exact same item . when i got it , i found that it was half an inch wider than the first , a different shade of color , and the pile seemed thinner and flattened . now i 'm ordering a pair from a different company . hopefully the higher price indicates better quality
0	i bought this set after reading the positive reviews but i must say that i am terribly disappointed . two of iron broke ( yes , broke ! ) while i was practicing in the range . its completely worthless and i strongly suggest to stay away from this set
0	this pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls . but there 's no way to attach it securely to the pump ! the instructions are completely useless . does not deserve the one star
0	well i purchased this bike because i previously had a schwinn recumbent bike that i was pretty happy with but had to sell it because i moved . i 'm very disappointed with this upright bike though . i think the seat is very very uncomfortable , so uncomfortable that i do n't want to use the product . the seat design in itself it horrible . the way it bolts on is a little strange , and it appears all the schwinn upright models are like this . even though i have the seat bolted down all the way , it still wiggles . as others have mentioned , my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it . in fact , the ups driver actually told me that i might want to refuse the product , but i took it anyways . i think i 'm going to attempt to return this if possible . although the entire process is a huge hassle since i work everyday , the box is trashed , and how heavy the product is . i also had to help the ups driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt . i do n't recommend any schwinn upright bikes , although i likes their recumbent series . i hope amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this
1	the product works as anticipated . i was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included . this advertising was imprinted on the product 's box so it was not just a stick-on label afterthought . i think someone tampered with the box before shipping
0	i have purchased this backpack ( in black ) in august and i have n't actually used it until december of '06 . i was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail , and on the first day , this pack ripped . my left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom , and i had to secure it with a square knot . the next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place , and i had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt . also , i have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it , and the flimsy peice of plastic broke . it still held , but i had to check it twice every time . i tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking , and the left side of it ripped partially . another thing that happened was that i was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking , and when i came home , i noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when i leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath . the bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric . this pack is nothing but a glorified backpack , not meant to hold anything more than 25-30 pounds at the most . if you want a backpack that is dependable , buy something else . if you want something cheap for a day hike or something , i suppose this pack is for you , but i 'd still say that this pack is not worth it .
0	it does what its supposed to do , but its made for someone 5'6 '' i 'm 6 ' and not really enjoying it
0	i love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear . i tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable . i sent an email to speedo to let them know .
0	rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family 's emergency kit ( and ecologically smart to boot ) . while this product is satisfactory for , say , a science demonsration on the faraday principle , its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited . to its credit : this flashlight was meant to last , and will stand extremes of water and temperature . when dropped into water , it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval . it 's so sturdy tha , it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you ca n't say that about too many products . shake this light for a while , and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time . while you may read claims of up to one or two hours , a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes , and then you shake again . and again . as long as you do n't mind the repetition , the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency . but do n't entertain thoughts that you 'll be able to read , find small objects , or perform any kind of detail work . if you do n't have a chance to compare this to its better competition , you might not know that say , the sherpa xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by . while no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you 'll find in a traditional flashlight , your options are brighter if you stay away from the diamond gen . invest in something more powerful and you 'll find that a flashlight 's usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight was disappointing , and useless in any practical context
1	i have been using a headlight for years when i work night shift at the hospital . when that light gave out , i bought this one . i like having the three settings of brightness . though i had a light on my bike handlebars , i wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet . it came down to two choices and i went with the aurora since i had been impressed with it at work . it turns out that it is brighter than the light i had on my handlebars that i paid more for just last summer . now i wish i had gotten an aurora for my handlebars , also
0	this would be a great rebounder , if it were not so cheaply made . one month after happily using it , a spring broke , then another . it is one of the least expensive models out there and i guess there is a reason for that . best to save your money and buy a more expensive model
1	body max is a very tough dvd . i did n't find the step choreography too difficult to learn , but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced . i do recommend watching the cardio before attempting , or you 'll be rewinding quite a bit like i did . cathe 's cuing is great , especially while teaching the combo . the complete workout is long and tough , but completely worth it . if you do n't have enough time , there are several premixes that have shorter lengths . the premixes may be shorter , but they 're no less intense
0	do n't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics . other exercise equipment comes partially assembled , this just has alot of odd pieces . complaint : 1 ) no `` how to assemble '' video as other brand names include . 2 ) instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague . 3 ) it took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble , and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled , it can not be diassembled . if i had known what a giant project this would be to assemble , i would never have purchased it . this is tony little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine , which body by jake products usually are . how much more would it have cost them to put in a a `` how to '' assembly video ? i 'll never buy a tony little product again . that said , it 's very simple to use . since this is the heavy duty model , it 's heavy to move , and it takes up alot of space . it 's a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space . if you have a small room , think twice about this model . millie in californi
1	i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the 400 lbs . besides the floor . the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more , the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little , when you put the max weight on a slot . but it does its job
0	we bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest ( of three ) was a baby . i totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe . we only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side . we used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up , and still had this problem . maybe an older , much more stable child could use it , but it is advertised for use with infants and it 's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing
0	used once . unit blew a fuse . no manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body . no contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller . had to calculate fuse rating . unit is very slow to make coffee . power plug does not fit well in 12v accessory recepticles . does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place , has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle . no return information provded . considering all the problems , i would not buy another product from this manufacturer , nor would i recommend it to anyone else . unit is overpriced
0	who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs. ? ? ? ? are only skinny people allowed to loose weight ? please - find a brain and make it those of us who really need it
1	flowboards r way better than real sk8boards.they look cooler probabally ride better than normal sk8boards.i seen it advertised on a commercial decided right then thats what i wanted for christmas
0	my mom wrecked badly on this the first time out , due to the difficult-to-control steering . very awkward handle bars ... several of us tried to ride it . my friend -- a fitness pro personal trainer -- put it best by saying `` that 's the most uncomfortable bike i 've ever ridden . '' mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive . i hope somebody likes it . : -
0	i had to repurchase this product , because my first one broke , the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic , seriously a design flaw . however , with some epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better . in this case you really get what you pay for ... its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily . i wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times .
0	too big and cartoonish , also very hard to get hands and arms in or out when fully inflated .
0	this would be a great tube , except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position . unless you 're worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake , find another tube
0	easy to use in the configurations shown . however , 3 million candlepower does n't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 - 20 minutes of use
0	the table is easy to put together but it is uncomfortable on your feet to use .
0	i bought this for my 43 lb , 6 year old daughter for christmas . the back fender , main body , headlights and the rims are made of cheap plastic . this toy was broken on the first day she rode it . the back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless
1	i bought a red ge lantern a couple of years ago . i have used it for power outages , walking my dogs morning and night during the winter , and rarely , i 've even used it for camping . i have n't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours ge states . i find the light to be strong enough to read by . during dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it has n't phased it . and it 's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens . though i have to admit , neither the dogs , or i wanted to be out very long in weather that cold . the workmanship is very nice . i recently looked at coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top . the ge lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog . the only downside i 've found , and i do n't consider this a big issue , if the lantern is knocked hard enough , say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain , the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out . it is easy to fix , just transfer both dog leashes to one hand , turn the lantern upside down , unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up . i would definitely purchase another ge lantern .
1	it 's a nice rope , with great length . my only problem is , it really stings if it hits you . overall , it is a good robe
1	bought this bike for my wife . it arrived a day late for the next day delivery . the packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok . the directions for assembly could n't have been more clear and easy to understand . it took me about an hour , taking my time to put it together . the bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time . also very comfortable
0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym , after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous . i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems . i put on the valeo straps and did one pull-up , and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in . my advice , this product is poorly made and cheap . a complete waste of money . go with something better , and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric .
1	hot water in my flask does n't stay hot enough for a whole day out , and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature . i have n't tried heating water from cold - it is always at least warm when i start . it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious , but it does a good job . the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug does n't ( it flops about ) , so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed . it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush
0	i expected much better quality from thule . as used according to the manufacturers recomendations , this bag did not even last one trip from new york to chicago without it 's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off . in addition , the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car . the contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that 's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car . this becomes a terrible distraction while driving . all in all i had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it . opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers , they cost much more , but are worth every penny . in the end i thought i was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a sears x-cargo container to replace it for my return trip back .
1	i already owned a fenix p1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny . it was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me . even a great light source is useless if it 's not accessible when you need it . i owned a surefire ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive . but you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades . i love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light . i expected some similar design elements in this new fenix . i was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right , then left right again and so on . so if there is one setting you use most often , you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time . come on , that 's just stupid . i will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires . but there is no comparison as far as construction or quality . so 4 stars is all i could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction .
1	with the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get , it 's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50 % + more . solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber , i find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones . i even told my chiropractor that the thera-band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $ 75 for . it even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board
0	on my third pair since i purchased these gloves from amazon a few weeks ago . first pair had velcro on the inside sewn into the seam . very irritating , especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough velcro dig into the palm of your hand . medium size was smaller than advertised , shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use ! harbinger customer service was very helpful , and sent me out a new , larger pair for free ( had to return mine first ) . this pair shows up , and the gloves are two different colors ! blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other . strike two for quality control ! waiting for a 3rd matching pair from harbinger . again , harbinger customer service is excellent , but the quality control of these gloves is less than average
1	had this device for 3 months , absolutely love it ! the chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to , but it is very accurate . the most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran , the speed ( max and average ) , and calories expended . this allows you to control your pace while running by speed , or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate ; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function . you are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you 've reached a target heart rate , or time , or speed , and even resting rates , laps , etc. , essentially letting you program your interval training . distance is very accurate once calibrated manually . never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before , but i chose this the gps based hrm because i need reliability ( according to some reports on gps based hrm , the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings ) . besides , if i get lost , i figure the extra running ca n't hurt me =
1	my table was shipped on a thursday and at my house the next day ! ! ! as someone mentioned , the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is . there are n't that many parts to put together . a tip : because of the weight of the box , i recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually . ours is on the third floor and i took about three or four trips to get everything up there . i use it daily and really miss it if i do n't get to . i could really go for some inverting right now . i found the cuffs very comfortable . shoes/boots are helpful , but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks . i should get commission on these things . the first weekend we had it , we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it . great deal ! !
0	i can do this without the system , it 's simple why do n't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups..trust me it works , i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything
1	i had the original solid red victorinox that was borrowed and never returned ( it was about 10 years old and still going strong ! ) so i purchased this one . i came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire , amethyst , and red for christmas gifts . everyone loved them ! small in size , but a real workhorse , and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk . it came in handy opening the boxes that were taped , and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now . i definitely recommend this product . if you have very large hands or need a larger blade , buy a larger knife ; otherwise , this is the one you want .
0	9 of 9 people found the following review helpful : everlife is littlelight , november 22 , 2005 reviewer : agnazzo ( tampa , florida united states ) - see all my reviews living in florida i bought two of these everlife flashlights . the party that said that these flashlights are charged up during shipping is suffering from shaking of the head . it takes at least a minute of shaking after delivery before the flashlight is giving out its maximum amount of light which is very low . after that to keep it operating more shaking is in order . the illumination which is very low compared to other battery flashights dies out very rapidly and need additional shaking to keep it going . this flashlihgt to be fair may come in handy during a hurricane power failure . led flashlights that use batteries are far superior to these shaking flashlights.the batteries last a very long time due to the low power that leds operate at
0	your money could be well spent on something other than this , not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal-mart
0	other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason . over 65 % of the decks are marked and unusable . that means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be ok for poker play ( unless you 're lucky ) . i have purchase casino used cards before and honestly , they are not worth the trouble
0	basically , i ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks ! that was really long , especially because i upgraded my shippping . i dont ' like this because the grip is n't really grippy ( lol ) and the strings make your hands hurt because they 're kinda loose . the only thing i like about this is that it donates to breast cancer , but i really do n't recommend this raquet . i bought an n-code right after i tried to use this 3 times . very unsatisfied . this wilson does n't live up to the wilson reputation for m
1	i used this for paintball on my military simulation a-5 . i see other sights and i was worry about this since its cheaper . the red and green dot is much more visible then my brother in law more expensive bsa also . about the manufacture website , it is a 40mm . dont know why they said 30mm . but like some sight , the lens ( both front and back ) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly . overall , it worked great . i can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them .
1	these bikes arrived very shortly after ordering , were exactly what i was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble . the only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and i did n't know who to contact
0	the only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say , cool . well it cant even shoot , so its not cool . this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic , and i looked inside its only held together by the outside . the laser is off target ( and sucks ) and it shots as fast as u can throw it , if it shoots . i had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off . it fell apart after 1 hour . it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made . those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it
1	i received the exact item i ordered , and quicker than i thought i would get it . the price was right , too
0	i ordered 2 of these flimsy tables . they were not only expensive to ship , but one arrived damaged . the one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully , meaning that people 's drinks would slide off the table . these are the most flimsy tables i have ever encountered . if it were n't for the replacement tables i found at costco , the party i planned would have been a disaster .
1	better than any club shop product . perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for 9 holes
1	just 3 weeks ago , i came here looking at reviews for the tony little 's gazelle freestyle , and read mixed reviews . however , most were encouraging , and i thought it sounded like the thing for me . i have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks , and have already seen results ! this is no lie -- i lost 2 inches in the waist , 2 in the hips , 2 in the abdomin , and 2 in the thighs . i 'm just as freaked as you may be , but i 'm telling you , this is the honest truth ! i was discouraged that i had not been seeing any results on the scales lately , and needed to change things up , so i 'd see something move again . this gazelle did it for me . at this time , i 'm only up to 30 minutes a day , and 1-3/4 miles ... i 'm still a work in progress . but these results are no lie . just think how much results i 'll see when i can stay on longer ! they advertise it as a low impact overall machine , and it truly is . i have rheumatoid arthritis , and fibromyalgia , so i was looking for something i could do that would n't hurt me . i can honestly say i get a full workout on this machine ... oh , i forgot to mention , also 1 inch in the arms . so , that 's a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks . this is the best machine i 've ever used , ( we also have an exercise bike , and ab lounge , which i 've not used in the last 2 weeks at all , cause i was getting such a good workout on the gazelle ) and i 'm so happy i found it . and i thank you people , users of amazon.com , for coming here and posting your reviews , and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy . mine is the exact picture above , and folds up . i also love that feature . it 's not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use . therefore , i 've still got lots of walking space beside my bed .
0	the frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike . i have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter , derailer , brakes and other small items . this bike is not schwinn 's usual quality . very disapointin
1	arrived just in time for the snow , my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun , however , it requires the user to have good balancing skills , like a skateboard . i would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl
0	broke first time i used it . when it worked it was highly inaccurate ( i own a radar speed detector ) . save your money
0	if your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go , but the fins are low quality and i would only wear them if i wanted to get laughed at
1	i had concerns when i ordered this machine . like the fact that i am so short . i did n't know if it would be designed for taller people . it worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height . ( i am 5 ' ) i also had concerns because i have arthritis but i was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and i am able to set goals and get a decent workout . i am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me . the only drawback that i have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit . mine are starting to get use to it a bit . this machine is worth the money . i would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as i am . it is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain
1	i have had one of these for 10 years , but recently purchased a second one because i was having to move them between the rv and house . this case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement . every outdoor person or cook should have a deluxe blade trader in their set
0	machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also , no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions , i have never heard from the
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions . one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still . as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me , i urge you to buy something else
1	quick shipping - i received this bike in 4 days ( using free super saver shipping ) and it was even over a holiday ! the bike comes in one large box with many pieces . my husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour . it looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble . the bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas . it is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike . the resistance goes from 1 to 8 ( one being the easiest to eight being the hardest ) . my husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride ( like riding the equivalent of up-hill ) . the bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large . the display is easily toggled through . the heart rate monitor picks up okay , but do n't buy the bike based off of that function because it 's not totally reliable . all in all , a great buy ! i injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back . the seat is uncomfortable ( and i am petite- i would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger . but for the price , you ca n't beat it
1	when i got the machine and started putting it together , i noticed i was missing a few small pieces . understandable , i think , as this machine was shipped from germany . 3 $ and a trip to my local hardware store later , the kettler kadett was all assembled . i had some problems with the foot straps loosening while i exercised , but i found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area ( to provide an additional foot strap ) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem . with the exception of those minor nuisances , the kettler kadett is an amazing piece of machinery . when i use it , i can tell it 's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts . it went together easily and it 's solid as a rock when i use it . i 've never rowed on a real boat in my life , but this feels just as i 'd imagine it would . and of course the most important part , when i get off , i feel like i 've gotten a gym quality work out . 4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine , the packaging could have been better and slightly re-designed foot wraps , but all in all an excellent buy
1	if you 're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles , this is an excellent choice . it 's also very quiet and it 's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me . only problem is that i wish the seat adjustment were easier to work . it gets a little stuck sometimes . again , if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice
1	i bought this hiking pole to take geocaching with me . it 's sturdy , lightweight , and retracts for easy storage . it 's also nice that it absorbs shocks . a good product for the money
1	easy assembly , great variety of equipment to train your body , pretty sturdy , great value for what you get , only negatives are the rack arms are close together and you cant reverse the bar pins to rack the bar for easy access to do squats and military presses
0	it only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs . does n't run well over pine needles or leaves . ( make sure to rake the yard before riding ! ) the acceleration in slow , the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens . i spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing . it stops when the child tries to make a tight turn . all of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable , when in fact it only works on the paved driveway . do n't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person ... it 's been 3 days and still have n't heard !
0	my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it . they were so disappointed : ( this has now happened twice ! ! ! ! ! fyi , the first one we inflated and it deflated within days ( slow leak ) . what a waste ! it is so heavy that it would cost $ 20 to mail it back for a replacement . do n't bother .
1	my child recieved this for christmas . he loved it so much . his older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too
1	these gloves are extremely high quality . they do a great job of protecting your hands , and for most exercises , they do help your grip . the have the best wrist support of any glove i 've used to date . however , as mentioned : if you have small hands , the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general . this is a problem for exercises like deadlifts , chin ups , etc . also , the material inside is a bit like felt . when your hands are sweaty , these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off . they may just need to be broken in more , but i 've used them for 3 weeks thus far .
1	when the product came i realized that it was n't what i was looking for in a fanny pack but i was impressed with its rugged construction . i needed a pack to walk around disney world and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy . i like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day . the water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you ca n't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle . plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another dasani . unfortunately , you ca n't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that would n't stop a regular 16 oz . job from slipping passed . so i 'm returning mine , but if your looking for non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , in a rugged waistpack then this is for you . ps for some reason the blue one is cheaper , at least when i bought it
1	if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of [ ... ] well look no further ... this is the best tank ever . i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them
1	this item in the green was on backorder which i did n't know when i ordered it . the seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but i really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait . has scissors , tweezers , two blades ( one has a file on it ) and a toothpick . there 's an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring . the edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic - very pretty
1	i have stopped at least 5 shops ( walmart , sports authority , target , etc . ) to find foosball replacements but no avail ; the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls . the foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised , and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends
1	i bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend . no problems at all with shipping ; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps . i opened up the box and brought in pieces individually , with the flywheel being the heaviest ( though i was able to bring in myself ) . it took me about 2 hours to put together . instruction book was better than most i have seen , and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes , but you can figure that out easily ( as everyone has noted on their reviews ) . the elliptical 's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room . easily moved if need be . in regards to the workout . i cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective . there are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout . the backward motion is a little awkward for me ( i am 5'3 '' ) but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well ( versus the movable upper ones ) . the machine is very quiet , only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little wd40 . it has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level , which i was worried about as it does n't have an incline as some gym machines do . the heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out , so you just need to be aware of your foot placement . the foot pads are comfortable and a good size . most of all , for those who do monitor their heart rate , i have a polar f11 heart monitor ( with chest strap ) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most . i recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate . this held true for me even if pacing at 70 rpm 's or above . i listen to my ipod when i work out , so i have not used the book holder . the water holder holds 24 oz polar spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle . i highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home . it 's very well built/solid , quiet , effective , and affordable ( $ 599 , free pad , free shipping )
1	i got this belt because it 's the one my son 's physical therapist uses in his pool therapy . it 's great because it gives them some support but not too much . you can also remove floats as they get more comfortable in the water
1	the knife is sleek and has a great profile . i love the speedsafe function on it . the blade lock is a bit stiff , but i suppose that 's just so it does n't slide open on accident
1	my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box . excellent quality . looks very expensive .
0	the day we received the stroller we were very excited . we put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction . however , when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow . of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming . we have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company . i would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time
0	i bought this product on a friday and arrived on a thursday ... good shipping time but a horrible gun . the pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic . the whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying . i payed $ 30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday ... complete waste . the laser 's wires split , the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the fps ( feet per second ) is slower than my berretta pistol . also the binoculars are cheap as well ... it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product . use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the $
0	i bought this item based on other people 's reviews . i 'm sad to say they were wrong . maybe it 's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box . the gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as i started firing it . it sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go . my recommendation , well , just look at my title .
1	i am very impressed with the f4 . it is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor . it is easier to program than my f6 , and it fits better . polar makes the best hr monitors , and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded , and even with ones that are not from them . i have vision fitness exercise equipment , and the strap works with their hr function . sometimes i strap the watch to the equipment so i can read while i exercise , and i 'm able to continually see the hr without constantly changing the view on the equipment . the color is more of a gray color than an ice blue , so it goes with just about anything you wear . i 'm really looking forward to using this unit while i go out and do my walks this spring ! i ca n't imagine buying anything else but polar . this is my third watch and all three of them are still working well
1	i thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open . i was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster . other than that , this knife is ultra high-quality , definately the best i have owned
0	this looks better on tv than it actually works . the cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around . when it unwinds it does so very slow and loses it 's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it . plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with ? what are you supposed to hit it with then ? these things you do n't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up . do n't waste money on this item
1	i write a lot of reviews on books , but seldom write one on a product.however ; i feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.i , like i suppose , just about everyone else , keep looking for the lite that is right for all people , for all purposes.if it exists , i have n't seen it yet.the plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since i got my first as a kid,60 years ago . they often fail you when they are needed , batteries are expensive , but overall they serve a purpose . about 50 years ago , a hand held magneto lite appeared.as long as you kept squeezing it , it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.it was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle , where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.however ; as soon as the bicycle stopped , the light went out . for some reason , they disappeared off the market.a few years ago , a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.the biggest difference is , it made a lot of noise when squeezed.they do n't appear to have been very popular . this faraday principle lite has been made very popular due to tv ads , more because what they do n't say than what they do say , many people are disappointed upon getting one . the ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.so what ! , we learned in the military , that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.so , if that 's not you were looking for , it is meaningless to you.in fact , it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.for this purpose , it ca n't begin to compete with a normal flashlight ; and if that 's what you want , forget it.as a matter of fact , those little led keychain lites can do just as much ; and can be picked up for a buck at the `` dollar stores '' . they last for a couple of years , weigh next to nothing , and you 'll always have one with you.i leave them around the house and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot , or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure . these lites are so weak you ca n't assume they will meet your expectations in a store , or from watching a tv ad.my advice is try and compare with a key chain lite , one might serve you as well as the other , at a huge difference in cost .
1	it was just what i wanted -- a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv . takes about 30 minutes to put together . it 's quiet , stowable , and fun . my ten-year-old likes it , too . i do n't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as i 'm wearing shoes , so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue had n't been wearing shoes . a really nice little machine , and what a great price
1	practice sword is of superior quality . for the price it can not be beat
1	very high quality/durability . this glove works well as it should . only complaint ( splitting hairs here ) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast , and your hand will sweat . if you are an extreme sweater , you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated .
0	beware ! ! ! these balls are extremely hard . they are like hitting bricks . i bought them because of the name , penn . i bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of penn pressureless balls . after 30 minutes of play they broke my racket , my hand hurt and my arm hurt . i am now trying to return these bricks , i mean balls to swingsomewhere . i 'll let you know how it goes
0	i wo n't mention about the quality of this product . but this standbag does n't have enough weight to stand my punch . i filled this with water to the full , and when i throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down . am i supposed to fill this up with lead ? i 'm not bragging . i am below average young males ' heights and weights , i do n't work out , never had a boxing training , just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when i 'm depressed . i ca n't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff . i 'm returning this and get a real heavy bag , even if it will cost a lot
0	this poker set is the cheapest quality there is . for the price , i kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad ! the chips are plastic with a metal insert . the chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it . furthermore , the thickness of the chips are uneven . therefore , when you stack the chips ( depending on the color ) , 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips . the poker case handle broke the first time i lifted it . the chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly . this is really a bad product which should be banned from amazon . save yourself some grief . spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set ! what a waste of time and money
1	i just ordered this beauty . the price is right , the price will probably be more expensive in a few months . the full tang is very sturdy . the handle is usually a lil thin ( flat ) on these type of blades . i was also looking at the galaxy viper twin blades in silver ( also comes in black ) but there 's no pic of the shealth . it just says it 's nylon shealth . it holds the 2 blades . this was n't exactly what i was looking for so i chose the ronin . btw , i got the last 1 from a seller . they were out of stock last time i checked .
0	not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower . this is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty . not usable as a shower . good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower
1	i 've had one of these for 13 years . one . for thirteen years . it still works great . please use it carefully , if you 're going to use it . you can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure ( or not ) repetitive stress syndrome . to completely avoid that , and any similar problems you 'll need dr. sonnon ... but in the meantime , just be careful
0	we were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure . as it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs , it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square . we were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of `` caves in '' . we finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the outside of the poles that attach to all eight legs
1	the scales/handles seem decidedly gray , rather than black . pen has nice length . battery hidden under plastic liner . even found a nice thin layer of oil of some tools ! : ~ ) ) at the outer limit re carrying in front pants pocket ... . unless work jeans
0	after 350 miles of moderate usage ( 6.5mph average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily ) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms , rendering the trainer inoperable . unfortunately this was considered a `` wear item '' and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly ( perhaps 20 miles max ) during the first year of purchase ( warranty period ) . i put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and , while it was great for burning calories , i never really felt that it was a `` quality '' piece of equipment . it appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these `` wear items '' , thus making repair expensive and difficult ... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving , load-bearing support piece . seems a little fishy to me . throughout the life of the machine i was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use , and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use . after about 70 miles i noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface . i believe this was also partly due to too much `` play '' in the interaction of the wheels and tracks , allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution . this machine does not feel very sturdy and , throughout the last month of its very short life , gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever i used it ... somehow i knew it was about to break and , unfortunately , it did . my hunch was real enough that i began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago . please shop around ... i would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout , but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine 's mechanical components . if you are an infrequent user this model may be ok , but if you plan on using it every day i would recommend that you keep on looking . note that my machine was a 428p which , at the time of purchase , differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring . the frame is identical in the 418 and 428p , which appears to be no longer sold . since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction , they are appropriate for a review of the 418 . unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems i experienced are likely to still occur . visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction
0	i bought this band in two strengths . it is advertised as `` 99.998 % free of soluble proteins and latex allergens '' and powder free and it is neither . i used them and got a skin reaction to latex which i would not have if it was only .02 % latex . customer service was helpful when i called .
0	the pillow top portion of the bed started leaking after few times of use
0	graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product ... this rack will scrape the paint right off your bike ; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around ; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords , ratchet tie-downs , etc . this was a complete and total waste of money - and damaged my bike . on top of all that , it is not an inexpensive rack ! save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack..
0	the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly . i could barely assemble it together because it would not fit . maybe they sent me wrong disks . i do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase . it does not work as well as i expected . also gofit web-page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it . waste of money ... i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works
0	tent leaks in multiple places ; including door seam , back panel , and through seams on rainfly ! this is not normal condensation ( i promise ) , but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked . the tent was set up according to instructions with rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants ( 2 adults and a three year old ) dry during a rain . made for a miserable experience .
1	the product itself was awesome and my son loves it ! ! ! it is just what i hoped it would be like.the box it came in had me worried at first because it was very flimsy and tearing in certain places . it made it difficult to carry from our porch to my room where i was hiding the kids c-mas gifts
0	the padding is too bulky toward the knuckels . there is no padding on the fingers . the gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster . overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves
0	i purchased these as a replacement for some joe weider shorts i have had for many years that have started to wear out . i bought 3 pair of these shorts , worn 2 of them 1 time each , washed them , and they both came apart near the seam . the seams themselves did not come apart , but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run ' in panty hose . the third pair is still in the box and i have not worn it , but i figure that the same thing will happen with it as well . also , one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg . the one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong . like i said , very poor craftsmanship and materials
1	i use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts to hurt or tighten up . shorter and less intensive periods of use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods of use . you do n't have to change clothes to use the inversion table ; you simply get on it , wearing a suit , blue jeans or pajamas . you 're not going to break a sweat ... you 're going to stretch your back muscles and spinal cord , which does n't take any physical exertion . you should wear shoes to help you hang upside down on the inverstion table without your feet slipping out of the stirrups i highly recommend it for people suffering from back fatigue and back pain . i no longer need to take any expensive medication to alleviate back pain or fatigue
0	received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it . you ca n't get it to pedal . the cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike . you need a heavier base and very smooth cycling . this model runs on a fabric type band on the inside . made very cheap . i do n't recommend
0	i ordered electric gloves . i recieved electirc sox . i would like the gloves to be sent to me . i can use the sox so would pay for them separately . the gloves were $ 29.95 the sox were $ 19.95 so i should have a $ 10 credit . if you can correct this error , it would be appreciated . r heins
1	the best bike ramp i have ever used . this ramp is good for going slow or fast . my friends and i went as slow as we could over it and we did not get stuck . this ramp will not breack . i live in an area of the country were it snows all the time and this ramp can handle the seasons . this ramp has been outside for two years and is in great condision
1	i bought this for when i work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building 's parking lot . the lighting is poor , and i 've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity . i bought this one because it seemed to have the properties i was looking for- a wide , even swath of light for close-in handy work . after comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for `` flashlight reviews '' , i decided on this one . having bought it , i actually wish i had gone for the princeton tec quad . the thing is- this headlamp is extremely bright . it has two buttons to select the light output- one chooses between using all 8 led 's , 5 , 3 or just 1 . the other chooses between full output , `` dimmed '' output , and a flashing mode . even with 5 led 's on the dimmed output , there is plenty of light for me to see what i 'm doing . the reason i say it 's *too* bright is that with 3 aa batteries , it 's kind of heavy . basically , i wish i had went for the quad , which has 4 led 's and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable
1	i bought this gun and 2 days after the dang stock broke . other than that it was ok , good acuricy . the clip holds 545 in the amunition holder . and 15-17 shots in the magazine . also the lazers sight does not work
0	i got this net and set it up in february and been using it fairly regularly . i was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment ! should n't a $ 100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months ? completely unacceptable
0	i 've had my suunto advizor for 16 months . i am now in iraq and the bezel is broken-off , like the other reviewer . i dont have my receipt . you can go to the suunto website , but one thing you wo n't find there is an address with a note that says : `` send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it . '' my g-shock , by comparison , lasted longer than i wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the suunto cost . so i give the suunto one star , for being adventure-cool for a while . a lot of other infantrymen own these , so i jumped on the bandwagon . i wish i had stuck with a regular watch and a gps ( with lensatic compass backup ) .
0	this is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really , really hate . this thing does not shuffle plus it will eat up your cards badly . do not buy this piece of garbage ... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so . if you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new card shuffler . 1 . pet dog 's chew toy 2 . door stop 3 . play street hockey 4 . stress release stomping toy 5 . mother-in-law birthday gift 6 . modern art for coffee table 7 . nerf ball target practice 8 . condom dispenser kind of think about it , this is a great toy . have fun ! ps . if you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at : excalibur professional 6 deck card shuffler ; you might like it
1	this is a great pair of swimming goggles . i swim a couple of times a week and i ca n't see a thing without my glasses . this pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision . i ca n't imagine swimming without them . they have a wide field of vision , the adjustment is easy to use , and stays adjusted . i 've never had a problem with leaking . for less then twenty dollars you ca n't go wrong . they are the best goggles i have ever owned . much better then the other brands . also , i recommend going slightly less then your current prescription , as the water will magnify things .

1	these mats are easy to use , and pretty durable , but i find them to be too slippery . not enough friction . a thin rubber surface would be much better
1	this is a very realistic pistol . the blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing . it 's range is n't as far as rifles , but it still shoots across the yard . when you got shot with them from 10 yards away , they still hurt a little . one time , my dad , brother and i were battling in the front yard , and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing
0	i was excited to purchase what i thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics , being a ken onion design . what i bought was designed to sell and not to last . the handle was textured on the sides , but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely , especially if they were to ever get a little wet . the thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly . the spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild , absolutely non-abusive use . the $ 12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $ 84.00 ... and what if the spring breaks again ? my advice is buy another brand . p.s . the only reason i give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder , absent the `` blur . ''

0	our three year old twins received two of these cars for christmas . the joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on christmas day ! my husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that , the other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we are stuck with two broken cars and one that does work , but are wondering when that one will break too ! i need to mention that the kids were not particularly rough with the cars ; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior . the controls are cheap and will break eventually . the cars are very loud , but on the positive side , the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them . i would definitely not recommend this product
0	i purchased these so i would n't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat . however , they did n't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws . additionally , after only a few classes , the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws , particularly on the foot paws . i guess they would be okay for someone who does n't ever have sweaty palms and who does n't do any intense postures . otherwise , i would recommend doing what i do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . why by a gun from these guys ? if it arrives broken , you pay to ship it back . want a refund ? you pay a 15 % restocking fee . take a pass on airsplat .
1	i 'm just turning 14 and i started skateboarding about 3 months ago . i got one of those cheep walmart special skateboards and i couldnt do anything with it . then i got these bearings and popped 'em in and they are slick and smooth . i swear this made my board a good 20 times better
1	i take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week . so when i travel on business taking a mat along is n't the best plan . so i purchased these and when i traveled they were great on the hotel carpet . i read some of the other reviews that they are n't durable and i do n't think these were designed for everyday use . regardless , i love them for travel or when i ca n't make it to the yoga studio
0	we purchased this atv for our son who turned 7 in february . the first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected . we fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it . the next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose . i tried to tighten it but the allen screw stripped and it would not tighten . in addition , the rear axle was bent from shipping . we called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims , not axles . i did not even try to replace the throttle because i knew the allen screw was not capable of tightening properly . so , i went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem . the next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so i twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out . i have to do this every time he rides the atv . the kids rode the atv yesterday and i changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it . i have change the setting about five times and the switch broke . it will no longer change to the slow setting . it is either on fast mode or off . needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does
0	i bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews , big mistake ! the cardio boot camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing . the beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun . if i knew what was n't included i would n't have bought it . they should list what 's not included in the description . it seems somewhat deceptive
0	i have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list . a flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging . sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness . 8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light . i have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land . this flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally , utterly and profoundly useless . your good money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever . do n't say we did not warn you ! this flashlight should have a sign on it that says i am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk !
1	despite what the other reviewer has said , this table is great . i delpoyed to iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems . the table is lightweight , and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly . i use it for my laptop indoors , but outdoors it works great as well ( provided a hurricane is n't trying to blow it around ) overall , it 's a great table that 's compact and easy to set up and break down . my only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams . i 'd buy another if i had the need for one , and everyone in iraq has complimented me on it because they 're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on .

0	i was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists . i avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes . we have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an i refuse to add to the this insanity . however , to my great disappointment , the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge . then the light ceases to function at all . amazon was great in sending a replacement two times , yet the same problem persisted . i checked with bell too to make sure i was n't doing something wrong and i was n't . this light is a great idea , albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by bell . the two stars are for the great idea
1	despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the sg4 , i bought it and am glad that i did . my experiences using the sg4 during play have been very positive , even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that i could only get a signal for some of the holes . the large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them . the sg4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge , center , and rear edge of each green . for golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs , the `` mark '' feature is marvelous . being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time . the sg4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future . i think the the downloading procedures on the sky golf web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort . i know several low and mid-handicappers who love this device , and i share their enthusiasm and opinion -- i am a high handicapper . i also own a bushnell pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the sg4 to be a far superior `` tool '' to the bushnell . note : there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their sky caddie -- the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year . the fees range from $ 30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to $ 80 for worldwide use
0	when i saw that most of the critical parts , the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic , i told my wife `` this is n't going to last long . '' in the very place i had concerns is where mine broke . a simple metal pin , instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference . i also just noticed in these `` customer reviews '' that right after someone posts a negative review , a positive albeit anonymous review is posted . that always makes me wonder
0	this mat may have a design flow , or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up . layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll . in the process , the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat . i suppose it 's still functional , but my brand new mat looks pretty awful
0	before purchasing this watch , you should go to a store and take a look . this watch is huge . the temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch , then because of your body temp . you have no idea what the temp . is . the barometer feature is displayed in millibars , not something i am acquainted with . i could not get the compass feature to work correctly . it took approx . 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ) . i returned the `` watch '' and purchased a timex , paid for shipping , and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly

1	my daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team . i have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport i will do with her other than walking or biking . i bought her this racquet because i wanted something easy for her , not too heavy , and reliable . the salesperson at dick 's sporting goods recommeded this one and i am happy to say that it has been great ! she has been able to hit the ball and with some practice i can see her becoming more confident . in fact , the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet ! i have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference ; one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet . this racquet has great shock absorption ; i have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain . i liked this racquet so much that i just bought a second one so my daughter and i can play with the same racquet . p.s ... .it comes in a nice case ... and the wilson us open tennis balls are an excellent choice for a match

1	first off i need to tell you that i 've carried a swiss knife since i was a kid . i have most of the styles . but this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason . for me since i do n't fish i found more uses for this in the most unexpected area . the `` fish scaler '' tool is one that i would never use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly , too much work . but this tool i have used more than any other on all my knives . i 've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights , pick locks . to measure things ( something you need more often than you think ) , to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher . since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it 's perfect to scratch those areas one ca n't reach . that 's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which i use except for the absurd `` parcel hook '' . this tool is useless and yet victorinox continues to install it on many knives . the only useful task i 've found for the hook is to tighten one 's laces on my boots when i snow shoe . anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook ? please post it if you have

1	my son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger.it was easy to put togther and is very durable.i would highly recommend it . he also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants
0	continuing their recent trend of crisp-looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets , topps has done very well with their 2006 line-up of cards . the basic card design does n't stray too far from their tried-and-true formula of having complete mlb stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player . these insights include quotes from players , teammates , stats from a particular time in the player 's career , nickname origins , etc . this is one thing that always set topps apart from the pack . the front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team 's colors . the player 's and team 's name are trimmed in silver . the back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper-right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card . with the collapse of fleer , mlb has begun working with topps and upper deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to athlon sports ' baseball preview . one aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season . it will be used to remove any doubt on collectors ' part as to which card is the `` authentic '' rookie card of each player . you 'll find cards with that logo in this set from topps . another fine addtion to this set is the mantle/bonds homerun cards . with the scandal surrounding bonds these days , his cards may not be worth hunting , but mantle 's cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack . topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual , but the real doozies here will be the `` autographs '' of all-stars such as john adams and benjamin franklin . topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the declaration of independence . i have n't been lucky enough to snag one of them yet , but the basic declaration cards are a nice addition to the set . with historic sigs and mantle cards , topps has proven that nothing is more american than baseball , chevrolet and apple pie . a nice set to get
1	we bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like disneyland . the swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it . our kids our three and one , both fit in the stroller comfortably . the only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents
1	very comfortable . they may be just a tad too long for a shorter person .
1	this is a must for car tent camping . the main burner will boil 2 qts of water in about 5 minutes . large enough to cook a complete meal small enough to be easy to pack
1	this is our second set of eyeglass mirrors . they are easy to use and once you get used to using them you do n't want to go anywhere without them . i even find myself checking my `` mirror '' when i 'm walking and do n't have it on . one drawback that we 've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent . but that has n't really been an issue for us . give these easy to use mirrors a try . i wo n't ride without one
1	it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions - since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it . it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it
1	this step is great . it really adds variety to my home workout . i use it on carpet and it really stays put . it does n't slip on the carpet , and i do n't slip when i step on it . i was a little worried because it did n't have a rubber stepping surface , but it really does n't need it with regular athletic shoes
1	the power glove is a great replacement if you hate wearing a chest strap . they always hurt my chest so when i saw this i ordered it and i am glad i did . this is so much easier to wear when i go for my walks or do the stair stepper
0	i read the reviews below and then went into the sharper image to test the product myself . there is no resistance what-so-ever and i simply can not immage getting a good workout from this product .
0	this waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof . we tried it on two separate occasions , both times fully closing each seal , but water leaked through anyway , soaking the contents . when i tried to return the item , the seller refused to accept it , claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly . despite what the company now says , the fact is that the item was defective . i see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem , and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company
1	these were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size . a little tight at the wrists , but these have great padding and serve me well
1	the shipping was very quick on this item . it arrived in less than a week . points for the seller . i just started using this item and i 'm very sore from using it . its working wonders various chest areas . took me awhile to get comfortable using it . i eventualy just gave up on the work out instructions and started doing what feld most comfortable and easy on myself .
1	you want to loose that gut , build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time ? then get a punching bag and pair of gloves . to be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days . you need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting . getting this right is half the battle . when you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else ! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months , guaranteed . start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet . take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove . tuck that chin in . you will cut your knuckles , even with gloves on , but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow . move around the bag and make those strikes count each time . feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you do n't want to make . within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace . everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger . your hands will become stronger . take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand , directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent . strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down , never up . harden up those chop areas of the hands . now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves , it is time to throw in some elbow blows . move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm . twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms . start striking with elbows , gloves or chops in whatever order you want . build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag . you will stun yourself . now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on close quarter combat . it beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies . try `` get tough '' by w. e. fairbairn for starters . rubber knives are also good . learn the strategy in `` kill or get killed '' by rex applegate . keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful world war ii trench warfare close quarter combat manoeuvres for self defence . and it all starts right here with the bag . bag owners simply have the power
0	this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased , i cant believe it , please dont waste your time or money on this , it b roke the second day , rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one
1	we got this bike for our 4 year old , and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years . the assembly instructions looked intimidating at first , but since many pieces are already pre-assembled you can skip most of them . it was a lot easier than anticipated . the only reason why i gave it 4 stars : it had a deep scratch/paint chip on the frame . but since i got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway
0	i purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat . problem is that it does tend to move when you put the mtx bag on . the movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases . another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and do n't have the seat raised up really far . if you play around enough you can get it to work , but if you decide to put on the topek rear fender ( which i did ) you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable . i just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher . bottom line is that topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements ( and some better instructions ) to make it perfect .
1	we are teaching my 6yo to ride a bike , but it 's not going well . he wanted a scooter , so i got him the razor a2 and ordered the razor pro for me . very nice ! supports my weight , is easy to maneuver , and is inexpensive ! the only problem is folding it up again when we 're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky
0	this item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice . i have not received my refund check . this is the first time i have had any problems with items sent on amazon . i like amazon because i can send a personal check and not a credit card . please send me my refund . candice m. tressler january 9 , 200
1	great swivel action , tough construction , easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag . worth the price
1	this product is n't a miracle product , but it does do a few things : it supports your back , it is comfortable , it does make you sweat ( mostly on your waistline ) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit . it 's not a bad product overall , but do n't expect a miracle ... you have to do the work for this product to help you at all . i do use it any time i 'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects
1	this is an excellent product . my 7 year old son had adhd and he is constantly moving . he has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non-stop from waking up to going to bed at night . his teacher was happy with his attention at school , but he was still fidgeting a lot . she gave him this `` wiggle seat '' for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class . my son has noticed as well . he has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night . he told me i needed to get him a `` wiggle seat '' for home because it helps him concentrate . if you have a child with adhd and you 're looking for alternatives to medication , this is a great product to try . and they 'll get great posture as a bonus ! :
1	i bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store . i have used it numerous times on camping expeditions . it outputs very bright light at full blast . the lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches . the only three issues i have with this lantern are : 1 . sucks the propane . i also have the coleman fuel lantern , and while it is not as bright , it can go for a week of camping on one tank ( 5 cups ) of fuel . 2 . loud . this lantern is loud when burning . the above mentioned lantern is much quieter . 3 . construction -- the fiberglass ( ? ) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern . hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern . i 'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light , but if you are looking for value , go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel ( pump up ) lantern .
0	getting the flashlight is a real problem . after paying for expedited shipping on dec 1 , meaning dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival . still waiting on the 17th . called customer service , who promised to call back in 10 minutes . never heard back on status . filed a claim for reimbursement on the item
0	i bought this watch because i wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size . it is huge - looked like i had a clock on my wrist . take into consideration
1	the large display is nice . the altimeter and compass do n't seem to hold their programming and need to be recalibrated ofte
1	we have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding . i started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect . construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet . the workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test , recovery and many workout profiles to keep you challenged . what started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter . i guess they had to try it after i continued to rave about it . time flies while you are on the 438 . best of all this unit actually gets used . if you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment ... look no further .
0	this thing simply does not work ! i bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and i can not even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this . it can not even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls . i tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if i get better result but no luck .
0	i was looking for a trampoline and i kept looking around for the encloser trampolines . i purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but i did n't realize that the trampoline came separate . i have the encloser kit witch i spent $ 70.00 on and no trampoline . when i looked on the internet i never saw that the tramponine was separate and it was n't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part . i also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard , therefore , in order to utilize the encloser kit , i have to spend another $ 110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit . i am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they did n't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline . bevery careful , it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate . i am very disapointed
1	i purchased two chairs , one for me and one for my husband . for me the chair is perfect . i weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good ! ! ( chair is way to small for him ) i love it for myself because when i take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories ! ! i would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places
0	i bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy . i liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks . however , this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car . even with my acura , i still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk . imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk . it 's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car 's trunk . i was mislead by amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car . yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in .
1	as a chef in a hot dc kitchen , i have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing . at one point , i even devised a kind of `` rosin bag '' of cornstarch suspended on a string ... this stuff works for me . and if it works for me , in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat ... it will work for you
0	about average for the price , nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight . the wide beam is fairly faint , with a strong central spot . this one will go out into the garage , and likely stay there .
1	i bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking . i find it an absolutely great backpack . it has enough compartments for everything i need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items . i found i did n't need the waist belt and never used it as it does n't do much . ( it 's not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways . i ended up cutting it off . it has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it . the padding on the back is very comfortable , i have n't overloaded this pack yet , but with about 15-20 pounds , it 's very easy to wear . it has straps for a skateboard/snowboard , and while i 've never used it for those , they make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to . i also like the cell phone pocket , which i actually do use for a cell phone . i liked that so much that i zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it . one downfall for me was the 2 side pockets . usually used for water bottles . they are quite small . my nagaline 32 oz bottles wo n't fit in there , though no problem with smaller sizes . the pack is able to be used as a camel back , though i did n't see a bladder specifically made for it . so in the end , i just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and i 'm really impressed with it . i would definatly recomend this pack .
1	i looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1/2 year-old autistic son to use to bounce on - everything was too big and too expensive . this ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly
1	i was worryed becuse the price was so good as to what the quality of this product would be , but as it turned out , the hats where great , and well worth even double what i had paid . i got a cubs hat for my son who is seven and my boyfriend for christmas . both of them had asked for one , and both decided to get on for the other one . unbenonced to eather on i ordered both hats at the same time and had them delivered . words can not discribe the joy that both of them had to discover that they had matching hats to wear at the same time . now both of them want tickets to a cubs game so they can wear their hats to it . . .i do n't think i will be able to get such a deal on that
0	this may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6-8 , but an older child would laugh at this one . i was embarrassed to even give it to my son
1	we bought this tent to travel with our newborn to the beach and it is amazing . the setup is quick and we are the envy of all beachgoers . it is lightweight and well constructed . i highly recommend this to all who desire shade and comfort
1	i am very happy with this jump rope . it was very easy to adjust to my height . i have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout . i am enjoying this jump rope very much . it is very light and user friendly .
1	i ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house . they are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride . they look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders , a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes . they are easy to assemble . they were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound . the ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you can not complain
1	there 's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars , because i think most people buy it for boats instead . so i 'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car . in summary , it works great . it 's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty . i 'm never going to jiffy lube again . it even works great on my lawnmower . using the extractor is very easy . just remove your dipstick , insert the extractor 's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan ( it might take some practice to get a feel for this part ) . once everything is in place , pump 10-20 times . this will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw . it takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts . that 's also why i recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one , so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot . some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way . unfortunately , i ca n't really speak to that , because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate . however , the consensus from stuff i 've read on the internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method . because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor , i always change my oil on time . previously , i drove for thousands of miles past my `` due date '' because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient . the extractor should be used after the engine has been running . the oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up , making the extractor more effective . also , please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled . most mechanic shops will accept your old oil ( i put it in a plastic orange juice container ) , just call ahead to make sure
1	the eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag , and a great value . we have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for . on an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys , and once into the low thirtys . our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags . these bags also pack well , and have a good zipper . for the money these bags simply ca n't be beat .
1	just beat the ever-living snot out of the thing ! when it 's wore out ... get another one and continue beating the snot out of it . merry christmas . blessings , eri
1	another reviewer said : i think this product needs a few improvements , but in all it is a strong value proposition . here 's what i would improve if i were in charge : 1 . a higher resolution screen so that the gui could present more information . 2 . macintosh compatibility . 3 . the pc cable should be included . as it stands , the cable and pc software costs nearly as much as the device itself . i say : as far as the higher resolution goes , i would n't want the print to be any smaller , especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout . concerning issue 2 3 i have no comment because i did not purchase the software . however concerning the unit itself , i have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars . noted suggestions for modification to the ecaddy . 1 . the clip should remain , however the ecaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord . this will allow quick and easy interaction to the ecaddy . ( i have to suck in my gut to work the ecaddy while it is on my belt . ) 2 . the order of the `` hole/par/handi '' buttons should be switched to `` handi/par/hole '' . again , this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the ecaddy due to the respective position of the `` player '' buttons . 3 . a thin plastic slot simular to the `` player name slot '' should be added to the back of the ecaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective golf courses . it is very difficult to remember the name of # 1 , # 2 ~ # 10 . 4 this is a big plus and should be a major consideration : the players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole . this will certainly please the user of the ecaddy . currently , i will preset the values before we tee off because i know no one will get a `` hole in one '' on a par 5 hole . it is very unlikely that they will get a `` hole in one '' on a par 4 hole and it is rare to get a `` hole in one '' on a par 3 hole . this way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the ecaddy for many holes . before this product came along , i had created a spreadsheet that i uploaded to my palm pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play . as far as the price is concerned , i feel it 's about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally . depending on who you purchase it from , after shipping and taxes you may spend close to $ 60 . i would feel very comfortable spending $ 50 tops for this product . nonetheless , the ecaddy was a definite blessing . mike taylor
1	i recently recieved this gift as a birthday present . the batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already , and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time , i fired off a few dry rounds and a few bb 's . the blowback is quite impressive ; i find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action . the batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far , i 've had no problems . the gun looks and feels authentic . i have not tried the flashlight during games just yet , though it seems very powerful ( after shining it in my eyes accidentaly : p ) . the main problem i had was with the magazine . to get it out of the gun , you must pull it out ; there is no magazine release button . this was n't too much of a problem for me , just new . however , when i was loading the bb 's into the magazine normally , the two halves of it popped open , sending the spring and bb 's flying . i put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement , and it works fine now . recommended for all not-so-hardcore players .
1	i purchased the kurt kenetic two months ago , and am thrilled with its performance and quality . if you are considering purchasing a trainer , fluid trainers are the way to go . basically , there are four major types of trainers : magnetic , wind , rim driven , and fluid . the later is the best , hands down ! fluid resistance trainers are more quiet , smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned . the only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid . there are three companies that have solutions to this drawback . i highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible . a good review page is roadbikereview.com . the cycleops fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet . they have a limmited warranty on thier products , but are known for standing behind their trainers for life , and will fix any issues probably for life ! the one up trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer , but uses no fluid in its designe , it is made in america and carries a life time warranty . the kurt kinetic , which i decided to purchase , is imho , the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak . these three units are roughly the same price , around $ 260.00 . steep ? think of it this way , this product is going to be your companion for many winters , so do n't buy a loud , crappy one with crappy customer service ! you 'll regret later that you did n't spend the extra $ 75 or $ 80 on a quality product . i also tested the blackburn fluid , $ 100 bucks cheaper , not bad for price , but since it is new to the market i was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration . i have heard amazing testimonials of how cyclops , kurt , and one up , have replaced parts and even whole trainers , no questions asked ! google these three companies and see for yourself
1	i 'm a single mother with a full-time job , taking part-time graduate classes are night . i have very little time to myself , let alone any time to go to the gym . i needed something that was fun and energizing to do at home , after my child went to sleep . i found the perfect product ! i recommend this to anyone that wants to get a good workout in the comfort and privacy of their own home
1	i 've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the butthead golf club cover , and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been playworld putt putt . there 's also no dress code involved there . now , on to the review ! i strongly endorse this butthead golf club cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten : fun ! those teets really help my handicap like you would n't believe . many clubs have a problem with this cover , because they 're incredibly elitist , but when i think of golf , i think of cow teets , and that 's why i refuse to play without it
1	there 's not much i can say about this item . it works , and that 's all i really care about . no leaks , it 's never cracked , and it 's stood up to some serious abuse .
0	ok , i really thought this ball would be great considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the nba . not so ! this ball feels very similar to the cheap $ 20 balls you can get at your local department stores ! feels similar to the wilson ncaa solution game ball , but slightly less tacky , but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber . i personally do not like that . this ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box , without a break in period . well , i hope it gets to feeling better over time , but since it supposedly has not break in period , i am very skeptical . i honestly do not feel the `` crosstraxxion '' design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball . if you like the feel of leather , this is not for you . i am not impressed ! search for reviews for this ball before purchasing ! the only thing you can do with this ball that you ca n't do with others , is say `` well at least this is the official game ball the pros use ! ''
1	this bike mount is solid and well made . the instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly . there is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted . the only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames . we added some padding and taped it on and it works fine , however
0	i ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately . one only counts about half the steps i take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that . i wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday . i could understand if one did n't work properly but i got 2 at the same time with the same problem . i would not recommend this product
1	i am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility . despite my previous instructor 's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time money , i decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the `` versaflex '' . based on this investigation , i purchased this machine in the very short amount of time that i have used it , i am really happy . for me it makes stretching very relaxing comfortable . i am very impressed !
0	i bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning . i had to order another inner tube . then on the third day of trying to use this stroller , the front wheel completely bent . what a piece of garbage . i only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all i was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb . the other thing i did n't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag . i sent this stroller back and bought a maclaren double stroller
0	my complaints about this stand : 1 . by far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward . there 's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip . if it was n't for this , i might say , `` well i guess it 's alright for 79 dollars . '' 2 . the clamp is n't strong enough to hold the bike securely . if you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post . 3 . the thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic . i 'm assuming it will break fairly quickly . 4 . the rotator is made of plastic - i have n't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator , but i doubt it will hold it . in my opinion this product should not be sold . if you just want to clean your bike on a stand , it 's fine , but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off , forget-about-it
1	we use these socks snowmobiling in -20f temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you 're are outdoors for a long stretch . note the amt of head from the batteries is very small , but it 's enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails . the do n't get `` hot '' , and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside . the amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office . battery life on high is about 10 hours - maybe 12 hours on low setting . l
1	i found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of mtb glove , 30-40 dollars . no offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors , but please ! i did some research on the web , and the harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources . the price was a fourth of the competitors , so i thought why not try them out . the gloves are great , and i have been very pleased with their performance . not only do they have a cool look factor , but they also are well made . there is decent cushion ( no gel unfortunately ) built into the meaty areas of the palm , where you would expect and need it . additionally , the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist , for full palm protection , which i like . another nice touch is the tough material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers . it serves the dual purposes of protection and grip . it is definitely tough and has handled some hard , hands first , touch downs . on the downside , i know i might get sweaty hands this summer ( live in sw desert ) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather . yet , this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction . if you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves , and dont need to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck
0	the first one i bought started going crazy within a day . the ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like . eventually i could not even power it on . i was told by pni global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours . did that then it started breaking down again . the temp sensor did not work because anywhere i placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold . they sent me another one which did the same thing . now i have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one ( my third ! ! ! ) . the good news is that they are nice in customer service
1	this item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container . the beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer 's instructions and baking in an oven . the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers , however larger spaces may require more than one . overall , this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container ( s ) . i would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted
0	i only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places . i would say that the ball 's tension would fall under the `` easy '' category . i 'd recommend the power web over this product
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost . you get what you pay for . she uses it a few times a week . after a little more then a month , the left pedal broke . she is not overweight at all , so that was n't the problem . i 'll spend the money for a good one next time
0	this machine is too easy . even with the additional resistance bands , it 's just not enough if you 're an active person at all . the assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine . i used it every day for a month ( until i felt i 'd gotten my money 's worth ) now it collects dust . i 'd sell it for $ 20 at this point just to get it out of my house . i see my easy shaper becoming a goodwill donation in the very near future
1	this is a fantastic product at an incredible price . i am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better . it has completely eliminated my lower back pain , the chiropractor never did that . buy this table
1	i 'm a 13 handicap and i 've never bought a swing trainer before , but i saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try . it arrived yesterday and i went through the warm-up and practice . first , the grip felt very uncomfortable . over the years i had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip . this device corrected it immediately , although i did n't know it at the time . after going through the routine described in the directions i went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls . my grip still felt funny , but my tempo , swing path and release had improved 100 % in just a few minutes . this morning i went to the driving range . the improvement was dramatic . my iron shots were longer and straighter , but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver . after about ten driver swings i got the hang of it ... and ... wow ! there 's a screen out at 250 yards . on a good shot i usually hit it on one bounce . today , i was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground . thanks david . i ca n't wait to get out on the course tomorrow
0	our three year old twins received two of these cars for christmas . the joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on christmas day ! my husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that , the other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we are stuck with two broken cars and one that does work , but are wondering when that one will break too ! i need to mention that the kids were not particularly rough with the cars ; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior . the controls are cheap and will break eventually . the cars are very loud , but on the positive side , the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them . i would definitely not recommend this product
1	i have arthritis ( psoriatic ) , diabetes , high blood pressure , heel spurs and osteopenia ( a pre-osteoporosis state ) and i 'm 240lbs . a real grab-bag of conditions to deal with ! i saw what happened when my mother broke her hip and i really did n't want to have that happen to me . but , how to exercise ? using a warm `` therapy '' swimming pool was about the only exercise i could do and that will not provide the weight-bearing exercise needed to re-form bone . just walking around is cheap , but i 'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well-lit and has gone downhill a bit , too . i just did n't feel safe walking around at 2 : am or whenever *i* was up for exercise . besides there were hazards like uneven pavement , high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with . i had seen the ads on tv for the gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me . i could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if i needed to , without any arthritis-taunting up and down impact on my joints . no more worries about where i was stepping and into what . i could exercise whenever i wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments . i could go as `` far '' as i liked and would n't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back . so , i got the gazelle and i love it ! i chose this model ( the power plus ) for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs . from the way it is constructed - which is very strong and solid , i 'm not sure that 's really it 's upper limit . this is not some flimsy , cheaply constructed rip-off . it does not move , sway or `` walk '' when i use it . yet , with the handles on the side , i 'm able to lift the back of the gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily , which really suprised me since it is such a heavy-duty machine . any downsides ? it did have a small bit of squeaking at first , but it never got to the point where i 'd be worried that i was disturbing anyone . because it is built so solid , it does command a bit of space . not too much , but it is not a model that will fold up so you 'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion . i 'd want to safety-fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it 's in action . over-all i am very pleased with this item ! well done , fitness quest
1	it gave me a lot of energy and i was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product . i also noticed better and faster results from using no-xplode . i like it
1	a standard 5 ' bar . not sure how accurate the weight is . it feels more than 13 pounds , but that could just be me . not a big deal either way
1	i think that the sword itself is great , the casing is cool , and the mounting wood is nice . the only things i did n't like was that the keychain , greiver , fell off once i took it out of the box . i also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade . otherwise , i think that i got an amazing deal
0	this is completely junk . do n't buy it . it colapsed in a 5 mph wind ( with out the sides attached )
0	read the ingredients . contains refined flour and sugar , hydrogenated oil , corn syrup , and artificial colors . for someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic , this would be a poor substitute for real food . i personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing . always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for you
1	i am a plus size person , 6 ' tall with 69 '' hips and within the 400 # weight limit . this chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy ! i did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one ! i will be buying more ! the manufacturer of the chair states that `` ... . a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use . we work in conjunction with str labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products . our `` reality check '' is for a travelchair® product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an `` agressive '' situation .
1	we bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1 ! my hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it . by the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it , gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages . needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd birthday . ( he just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off ) his sister is now nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps . dont just think about it , buy it . and the sooner the better . other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one . and forget the versions with brakes , the kids should only go as fast as they can handle
0	both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts ( the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope ) when the item arrived . i think that this is a design flaw in the packaging
1	i got this gun for christmas , and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air . this gun is a very good beginners gun , and a great backup in an airsoft war . im a sniper/backup man , and this is my backup , i am very happy with the performance of this gun . pros- has a decent rate of fire electric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shot comes with 8000 bbs ( great deal ) collapsible stock cons- small but manegeable magazine accesories are sketchy , laser broke t handle is very loose but helps stability accuracy on semi auto is ok not good not bad if ur looking for a decent beginners gun , or backup like me , than i highly recommend this gu
1	these clubs are great for a starter . the best part is the price . i was n't sure if i would really like playing so i did n't want to go out and spend a fortune . i found these clubs in the store and they were well over $ 100 , so i went with amazon and got free shipping . the clubs arrived much sooner than expected and i paid a lot less ! i am very happy with my purchase
0	shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product ! it is garbage . a waste of time and money
1	this tools is really really great . it helped me to overcome the problem i faced while playing guitar , specially the barre chords
1	if you camp , hike or ski then this is a great whistle to use . pealess means the cold will not matter and it will blow no matter what the weather . high pitched and piercin
1	i bought this on somewhat of a whim because i 've been wanting get a little more in shape ( got a little bit of pudge going on ) and i realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym.. time was somewhat of a factor as well . so i ordered this a few days ago because i read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right . set it up earlier today ; the quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than i 'd expected.. think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine . setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear . threw on some running sneakers and got on , and i 've got to say , the feel/motion of this thing is really strange at first . unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance , be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because , like it 's name , it is completely freestyle . it 's range of motion and rhythm is all up to you . have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance ? you might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing ( it 's actually kind of fun but of course , there 's not much of a workout factor doing it ) . after about 10 minutes , i started to get the motion down . it was pretty fun once i got the hang of it , but i agree with other reviews , it does make your feet sore ... might try putting some foam on the footplates
1	my wife and i put this thing together in about an hour . there was one cracked foot tread , but after calling schwinn , we had a replacement within two days and no hassles . if you are looking for a decent machine at a great price , this is a nice one . it is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts
1	i love these workouts . they are very intense , and the results are almost immediate ; however this series is not for beginners . the best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day . my only complaints with this series were the lack of attention billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves . all in all this was a great purchase for me . i will probably purchase the new bootcamp elite series
0	the thule load bars that i actually received were only 50 inches long , and i needed the 58 inch load bars , so i really could n't do anything with them . it specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars , but they were not . i even wrote amazon back to try and right the situation , but no one contacted me , so i had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length
0	terrible customer service , absolutely the worse . do not order from this website . i had a bad tape and it would not play , they refused to credit my account , insinuated that i had a `` duped '' copy from somewhere else !
0	package missing . it 's never be received . so i can not rate it
0	the best ever ! ! ! if you do n't have on buy one . but buy the bag
1	i bought the v2000 last year and it has worked great since then . the compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far . i always left my v2000 in the vehicle , although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot . the v2000 has visible at all situations . i can see it clearly in the dark with the v2000 's automatic backlight , and see it clearly on a sunny day . finding a good place to put the temperature probe , however , is a hassle if you want to get accurate results . calibration was also a hassle for me . you have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings .
1	these are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps . as such , they 're 108 '' long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands . men should use 180 '' wraps . everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on amazon
0	a hammock hanging kit is a piece of rope ! doh
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days . the bearings were in great condition
1	some people talk trash on this gun , and on how it 's not upgradeable . first of all , if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks , i 'd be amazed . second of all , for just .89 cents , you can buy some teflon tape , and wrap up the hop-up receiver , boosting you another 70 fps . search online for tutorials . second , there is a tightbore barrel out , which will boost you only about 20 fps , but greatly increase your accuracy . utg also has a drop-in cylinder upgrade coming out . so , there are upgrade , they just require manual labor , and you ca n't just buy them ready to go . if you 're willing to put time into your gun , it 'll be well worth it . i love this gun . i 'm shooting abou
1	after a several uses , the anti-fog starts to fail ... at the beginning when it is band new , it works great ! clear and sharp . i always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine ... still , the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly . the good thing is that it does n't leak ... that 's the important part . over all , it 's still a great product compare to other models . if not because of the poor anti-fog thing , i would have give it a 5 stars rating
1	when i used lighter , less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice . if my toe caught the mat , the edge would flip over and require adjustment . also , they did not cushion very well . in addition , lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced . when doing poses like the side-arm balance , my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and i would fall out of the pose . with the extra-long manduka mat , none of these issues is a problem . the mat is solid and dense , and stays put on the floor no matter what i do . it cushions really well , but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat ( not mushy ) . i beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great . durability is outstanding , and they show no signs of wearing out . ever . the extra length allows me to move with confidence , knowing i wo n't run out of room or slip off the mat . an additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat , so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice . in other words , you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer . the surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga , and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway . no complaints about stickiness . as for weight , it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around . it ai n't heavy , it 's the best yoga mat i 've ever seen .
1	typical aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wan na play by yourself or in a non official place ... ..i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot ... ..theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples ... . this is a very nice gun ... .it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality ... this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously ( aeg-tm ics , ca , aim m4 , g , g , ect ...
1	if you have ever been caught at a check out desk or some place in need of a pen and no one has one , then this knife is for you . the other day i was at the check out line of the supermarket , and when i went to sign the credit slip , i could n't as the casher has lost her pen . i then whipped out my keychain with this on it and quickly signed the form and was on my way . i highly recommend it for situations like this
0	i bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old . he liked the boat well enough ... even played with it when it was sitting on dry land . however , in the water , this boat is very tippy , requiring two adult hands at all times . not good if you have more than one kid and need that extra hand . i bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer . i would n't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat
0	i bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting . although well built , it is poorly designed . the place where the hit a way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs . the cables on the hit a way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit . you might get one or two hits in before it is unusable . a giant waste of money . the only reason i give it 2 stars is the construction is solid
1	and so does gadget dad and gadget kids . not only is it an affordable piece of equipment , but it 's great for the whole family . having twin boys age 13 and a husband and i who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months , we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives . this does just that ! i 'll admit , i was a bit upset when i found that gadget dad had ordered it because i was the normal skeptic , but it 's been well worth the investment and then some
1	we also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes . it could be improved on the hitch end but it was not bad . it does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches . it kept our bikes from damaging our suburban . we use it for adult bikes and also several smaller bmx bikes . it is more challenging to get the bmxs on . one trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike , then tilt it back up for the other three . also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway . we also bought a big schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked
0	did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike . it should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate
1	this was a gamble since it is n't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an nfl athelete during an espn interview . i started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily . two months later my strength has increased , my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished . my workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on mm but the results since using mm have made an impact , there is nothing else i can attribute it to . the fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . do not fool yourself , it is loaded with fat . it relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it 's true benefit . you will not get sculpted by using mm without commitment , you will only get fatter . but if you are committed and use mm as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance .
0	to call this a bad machette would be to generous . it is more accurately described as a machette shaped object . as other have noted the blade is thin , too flexible , easily rusts , and fails to hold an edge . the handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined . if you use it without wearing gloves this `` tool '' will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation . th sheath material is 1 step above paper . technically it will hold the machette on your belt . but if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath . i ca n't believe a company with a valuable name like coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage .
0	there is nothing wrong with this product , it 's how you use it . we almost ruined our $ 300 trampoline in it 's first week by using this product . we put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine . it rained the next day and filled completely with rain water , causing the trampoline to nearly collapse . it took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since . trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through . by covering it , you do n't allow it to drain . unless you live in a very dry climate , i do n't advise using a cover
1	i bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair . i am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web , or other computer work . it helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around . it is exactly what i was looking for
1	this was another gift for my grandson 's 1st birthday - he loves music , and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them - i 'm not so sure he understands that he 's adding instuments when he pushes each button , but as it lights up and the cube makes music , he totally enjoys the experience..
1	this is a real good ramp . i just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll-in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air ! overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major . it is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time . they are fun and you will have hours of fun ! ! ! : ) : ) :
1	i 've tried lots of goggles , these are my favorite . i did n't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly . and i remember the days when the one-piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well . these are adjustable : strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit . and it 's comfortable like the one-piece goggles and has a no-snag silicone strap .
0	as others have mentioned already , i found this thing to be very , very `` wobbly '' . i never , ever felt comfortable riding with my ( almost 4-year-old ) son on this thing . it just felt too unstable . i returned this after only a few days
0	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine . unfortunetly , the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical . i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
1	these gloves are pretty good gloves , if you 're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go . they are very traditional yet slip on design
1	we bought this bicycle for our son 's 3rd birthday . he loved the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride ! it has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels , but the bike stays steady while he is riding and does n't threaten to tip . we are very happy with this bicycle
1	i purchased this item as a gift for my mother . she has a huge outdoor swimming pool and will use it as a changing room for all of her grandkids . she 's very happy that her new floors wo n't be ruined by everyone coming inside dripping wet to change after swimming
0	granted this was on sale for 20 bucks , it was originall 75 , it 's poorly made , difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use
1	i did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery . my fears proved wrong . i received a heavy package not damage , with all contents inside . the bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike
0	this product never worked -- buttons were defective , it would n't stay on , it would n't calibrate . the seller - sky box usa - would n't exchange or refund because i was outside of the `` 30 day window '' ( this was a christmas present , and a very disappointing one at that ) . you 'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a casio watch
1	i was taking hydroxycut but it stopped working . gnc lady told me to switch to this . first it worked great , then about half a bottle down it stopped working . had to take more and more . went back to gnc . told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more , and more , and more . told me i should switch product every one to two months . just wanted to recommend that you do n't stock up on just one . it will work for a while but plan on changing once you do n't feel the effects anymore
1	included pump is very weak . better to inflate the bed using your own mouth .
0	the description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section . the bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . on top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that i could care less about . if i had to do it all over again i would have purchased `` perfect pushup '' by bodyrev which amazon sells
1	i was looking for a bike trainer , but did not want to spend $ 150 and up . took a chance on this one , after seeing it being sold by nashbar and performance . it seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure . i got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty . only 3 `` levels '' of difficulty , but this does not seem to be much of an issue . it is not too loud , but also not terribly quiet -- about as loud as our washing machine . overall , for the price ( i paid $ 80 ) , this trainer meets/exceeds my expectations
1	he 's always been a colts fan but with their superbowl hype , this football could n't have come at a better time . happy birthday , d ! ca n't offer anything but good reviews on the quality and look of the football
0	it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid
0	please advise me if i can get a new plu in senor temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work ? please advise asap thanks walter ga
1	my husband and i purchased this bike to replace my 4 year-old son 's 12inch toddler bike . our son loves that the bike looks like `` a big kid 's bike '' with it 's hand brake . i was concerned that my son would n't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work , but he has had no problems ! in addition , the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards . this bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes !
1	i love the procuct and it does provide the reslults predicted . however i would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or i would like to see something like this maybe in a vest/shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach
0	this cargo carrier is so flimsy that i thought it would fall apart before i got to my destination . the hinges are a joke and barely work . it is also a nightmare to assemble
0	mitts no good tore up in two weeks , inside came out . very displease
0	this tricycle is simply way too big . while the seat position is adjustable , even when adjusted , this thing is simply huge ! i imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster . by then , he 'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike , so i just do n't get the point of this . why in the world would someone build a trike so big ? i did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires , and was fairly sturdy ( at least in terms of construction ) . i suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike , maybe this monster would be ok . i did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though : first , the grips are fairly fragile plastic and i imagine will break after just a tumble or two . second , the way the seat `` adjustment '' works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar . this would be ok , but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar , so i had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place . overall , i 'm just not very impressed .
1	i do n't actually own one yet , but my boyfriend does so i 've been sneaking over to his house to use it until i make room in my own home for one . when i first used it i was like some of the other reveiwers , disappointed that it did n't work my abs the way i expected , but then i realized i was n't doing it correctly . it makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it ! the strap is way too small though , i usually just put my fingers under it , but there 's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does , like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight ... and i have pretty small arms . the range of motion thing is great , and feels so good on the back , which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground ( i used to do about 1,000 crunches a day but then i started getting bruises on my back from them and i pretty much hit a plateau where i was n't seeing any changes in my abs ) . i have so much fun using the ab lounge while i watch tv too , it 's a great way to make the commercial time go by . i would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs , it makes it so much more worth it
1	the cord-wrapped handle is a great idea , offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip . my hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice , particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place ) . the two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too . though you really do n't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original . it 's still a fairly cheap piece of wood , compared to an ironwood version , but at this price ( it was $ 9.99 when i bought it ) you really ca n't go wrong . a nice enhancement over the basic bokken . i do , however , prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off . nevertheless , if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended ...
0	the area around the velcro has already started to fray . this was a christmas gift so she has not had them long . i think that the quality should be better . the knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well
1	the kids at our church campout had a great time with the aerobie skylighter lighted frisbee 's we bought for them . they took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work .
1	this cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat ! the compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler . the lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat . it keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat .
1	i have 20 mo . old twin boys . i was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the disney mcqueen trike so i had to purchace another one . this trike has two different sitting positions , has a wide wheel base for stability , and sits lower to the ground . my boys still ca n't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - it 's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early !
0	i notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving . well , i received my first schwinn 438 about a month ago . i put it all together , and realized they did not ship an ac adapter with the machine . i contacted amazon , they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer . i contacted the manufacturer on saturday , they were closed . i contacted them the following monday and they told me the item was on back order , but , i could buy a compatible adapter from radio shack . i did . i came home excited to use my elliptical , unfortunately , the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating . i contacted the manufacturer again , they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months . they recommended i send the unit back to amazon for a replacement . i did so . i spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it ... quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box . about 3 weeks later , i received my second elliptical . same faulty console problem , after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together . contacted amazon and demanded a full refund and return . they did pick the unit up , and did not make me take it all apart this time , but , i am still awaiting a full refund . i have since purchased a vision fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area . i am extremely happy with the unit , although it was a few hundred bucks more . this was one horrific experience with amazon . i would n't recommend buying this product , seems like they are shipping out defective units
1	this compass is better than i thought it would be especially for the price . it 's a great deal . i purchased it for a car and it work well for it
1	i love this thing . it was easy to assemble , everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump ! mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm . if you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off . the suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly , and it therefore loses its suction . i 'd by it again in a second , despite this . would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested , but its not really a big problem for me . people come to my desk and love it . greatest office accessory evar
0	i saw another mini microphone it got one star , the review was telling me it was horable . if i were you i would get the maga phone one the top of the list , type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list . do not get this ! ! ! ! !
1	i had this set up in my daughter 's crib when she was a baby . it would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake . the music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think . the unit would turn itself off after a period of time so i would n't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her . this is a wonderful crib toy . i would recommend it for any newborn , especially those who have a hard time falling asleep
1	i have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years , and i have gone through all of the major glove brands . in my opinion , everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support , which means less twisted wrists , especially for beginners . everything else is well done , but not exceptional - it 's comfortable , and provides durable padding , although i myself have only used the 16 oz . versio
1	recently we had a chance to use a bongo board about 40 years old . it was all wood with quite a large drum . the one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons . it is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity . the drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost , and balance is frequently lost . finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them . great investment for year round fun
0	not well made at all and only works half the time ; and the programming changes on its own . i recommend spending a little more for a better piece . do n't waste money on this one
1	this kit also includes a speed bag ! ! the item description never mentions that . which is awesome , but i already ordered one because i thought this did n't have it . however it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind . the bag gloves are very `` budget '' just like they state . so i doubt they will last long . the heavy bag is fully packed , so the box is about 70lbs . other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp . with the free shipping
1	i bought this bike for my boyfriend for christmas . it arrived in about 3 days , rather than the expected 5-7 . we set it up on about half an hour . it comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up -- i read an other review ( prehaps on a different bike ) that you need a cresent wrench , however for this bike you do n't . he uses it every night , and i use it a few times a week . it 's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet ... granted i 've only had it for a month . i would definitely recommend this product
1	just the perfect cap ! . it fits like no other swimming cap . it wo n't pull you hair when removing it , neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning . very resistant material , and a great finish . awesome colors !
0	i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance . well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears ( where i bought the junkpiece ) says , '' ew , man too bad '' ! ! remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage . another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you 'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe maybe tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital !
1	even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money , but with the box , it is almost a work of art ( of course some stain in the bare wood would help ) . this cleaning kit is a must for any collector of japanese weapons
1	i finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training . my sons and i will begin training in kendo soon . i have a few regular swords ( not the display only variety ) and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords . i understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of amazon customer
0	i ordered this item , and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all . i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise
0	i bought this for our camping trip to the bonnaroo music festival in tennessee . the valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you 're securing the screw-on valve . unfortunatly , the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly . what this means is that you pump it up nice and firm , but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover . so you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have . i will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight , and the pump was robust and quick . however , the valve flap problem is serious enough that i am returning the product
0	the light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included . batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive . even with batteries the xenon light did not work . so now i have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries . the case was nice however
1	kids love this quarter pipe . however , did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had no directions . luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company . it did take a while to assemble
0	i never write reviews , but i had to make my comments on these socks . i bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work . i put them on and turned the switch to high . they do not even get warm at all ... i thought it was broken , but realized it was both socks that did n't get warm . these are a total rip off and i am going to try and send them back .
1	the suit itself is great , but the sizing is just way off . i purchased a large and an extra large for my kids ; the large is actually too big for me , and the extra large is enormous . it is almost as though they are sized for men instead of youth . hopefully they 'll grow into them . . .
1	i have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road , while playing sports , to drink while i am in class . the bottle washes easily in the dishwasher . the narrower profile fits easily in cup holders . i highly reccommend the n-gen . it is much larger than 24 oz . if you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity . it is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market . you can also use the bottle as i have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack .
1	this gun is awesome ! it shoots hard and fast . the battery pack was a little hard to get on at first , but it works . do n't fire them in the house . they put dents in the doors and blinds [ they shoot really hard ] . they bounce off the basement walls and really hurt , so go outside . i did a battle with my dad and brother , and it lasted 2 hours . it was great ! now my dad wants one of his own
1	i love my broncos bag it is very comfortable to wear and has lots of roo
0	i am disappointed with this product as i thought i was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which i give to my patients . this one is made of nylon and elastic . the stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use . the elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart . go with the stretch out strap which i have been very pleased with
1	i ca n't not imagine having a great machete , and it 's easy for me to imagine many things i would want one for . this one is cheap , not very big , and of good-enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush , chopping , and would be fine of fighting too , if you had too . truly , unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete , or really do n't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and do n't play jumanji or perhaps you have no arms ... this machete is for you ! with care ... chop on ... chop on ... samkoche
1	works great , keeps me from spilling on myself , especially when i have ice in there . does n't slip , fits just right . easy to get in and out . the bottle top screws right over it . i can toss it in the silverware spot in my dishwasher to wash .
0	well today feb 25 of 2007 the book still do n't arrive ..
0	i did n't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly is n't designed well . the target that hangs inside the cage does n't actually fit . and ... .. the netting does n't stop the balls . how 's that for a good product . 1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net . buy anything else
0	nutrex-lipo diet pills make me sick to my stomach . i never lost any weight at all . they just made me sick . i would not recomend them to anyone . ish
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived , it was very scuffed up and scratched . it also had a flat spot on it . i returned it for a replacement , which i got , and it was in the same condition . also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before . i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it . we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb . medicine ball and the same outcome . definitly not happy with it
1	i bought this dvd set at a warehouse store yesterday and i 've just finished the first workout . there are some familiar moves from the original tae-bo tapes , but these exercises are much more challenging . the 'billy bands ' add resistance to the basic moves . this allows you to get a strength , cardio and flexibility workout in one . the choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step . this is a very challenging workout , and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape . if you are moderately fit , you 'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating . according to my heart rate monitor , this workout burned a little less than 700 calories , so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors .
0	i have used a few different brands of stevia liquid . this is defiantly a sub par version as evidenced by the additions of glycerin and water in the product . i would recommend using a different brand that has neither
1	this item is well made . the tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy . the included exercise booklets are lame . they have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises .
0	i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services . i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase . ( mine in three months . ) the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself . ( in one occasion , they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it 's good . ) these back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months , and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you , even though it 's still within one year . i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise , not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying : `` this is our policy .
0	i bought this stepper to use when i am on the road for work . after 3 days , 10 min/day the `` plastic '' wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off . i replaced the wire and began again . it was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped . the company , spartan , actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened . the unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs . i am below that weight but it still broke . if spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel , or rework the entire mechanism . this design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected . the rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part . since this product was manufactured in china it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty . stay away ! this product was made for extremely light people , not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there
0	the thing broke ! ! ! i never thought i 'd see a chain breaker tool that would break under the stress of taking apart a chain ! ! and the worst part is , i only used the thing about five times
1	you 'll never mistake the shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight , but that 's not it 's purpose . it 's a niche item , the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it . with no batteries or bulbs , you know it 'll always be ready for use whenever you need it . when it first arrives , you 'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up , but just think of it as aerobic exercise . once it 's charged , it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps , determine colors of wires or diagrams , and keep you from stumbling around in the dark . i was surprised by just how bright the shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking . the only improvement i can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off . when the light begins to dim , a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use . unlike the previous reviewer , i had absolutely no problems with delivery - i ordered it on 12/26 ( non-expedited mail ) and it arrived on 12/30 , exactly as described
1	this review is for nike t-90 club team ( 32 panels ) i bought this ball for less than $ 15 thinking i could n't go wrong . i had n't used nike balls before , so i did n't know what to expect . it turns out that this ball flies better , is softer , is rounder , and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls . great practice ball , and pick-up game ball . i would have no problem using it in a small club match either . as far as my $ 30 adidas balls ? not a chance . 5 stars based on performance vs. price . i hope you get as good a deal as i did ( through eastbay athletics )
0	i threw this away yesterday ( 3.30.7 ) first of all , it 's too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door . the tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home . i went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel 'collins axe # 4 ( wood ) splitting wedge ' to replace it . i bought a tube of hard as nail heavy duty contruction adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage . now that 's the way a door wedge should be ! do n't waste your money on this cheap chinese garbage called the 'super door stop alarm ' ! make your own right here in the usa
1	this pedometer is easy to set up and use . i tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile , and sure enough , my pedometer read 1/2 mile . the clip is sturdy , i have n't had any problem with the device falling off . the leash is a good extra - if it did fall off , it would n't hit the ground . my doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day , so i wear this all day long . it is light and i do n't notice i am wearing it throughout the day . the only downfall to this device ( as is probably true with others ) is that your stride is measured for walking , so when you are running or doing other cardio activity ( elliptical ) it does n't accurately measure your distance . since your stride is longer during a cardio activity ( running ) , and the device is measuring your walking stride , the distance measurement falls short . however , the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured . i suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap
1	i 've been doing yoga for 7 years . i 've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now ( i do n't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years ) , so i decided to buy something more durable . i love the texture of this mat -- it 's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it does n't move around at all . it has just the right amount of cushion to it , and i use it on a hard floor . i also bought the lumi towel ( large size ) , also by manduka , to put on the mat , since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time i get to the middle of my routine , and this can make any mat slippery . i did n't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit , and i used the towel until it did . i also did n't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy . it 's a bit heavy , but not too much to carry around all over -- i made a carry handle from a yoga strap ( looped over both ends of the rolled up mat ) and throw it over my shoulder
1	i own an older version of this net . it is about 10 years old and has been used once/week every summer . it was used in a high level volleyball league , but it would be great for recreational use as well . i paid $ 200 for the net and it is still like new . i ca n't believe this is selling for $ 69 . get it now
0	i found these gloves to be ok for short rides , but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful . i actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying . granted , these are mtn biking gloves , i do n't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand . i 've tried to break them in , but after a dozen or more rides , they are still stiff
0	this pedometer is not very reliable . it is very inaccurate in its count . it counts a step at the littlest movement . i put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260 . just moving it to look at it recorded more steps . if you want something really accurate spend more money
0	i bought this model a year ago , and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months . just recently , the deck cracked again . of course the warrantly no longer applies . save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand .
1	the sword itself is awesome to behold . though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play . no , i did n't hit anything . blade is heavy , would look good if it were not scratched so bad . can be polished up . if you know people to repair this , i suggest you do so . cool sword , chinese craftsmanship . should you buy it ? hell yeah
0	for all of the supposed 'resistance ' built into this machine , it enables you to do many -more- repetitions than you 'd be able to do of simple bodyweight 'core ' exercises , ( crunches , leg lifts , situps , and a multitude of others ) . why is that , and what is the effect ? 1/ why : the resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment . the so-called 'resistance ' actually -assists- you on the return motion , the exact opposite of exercise.2/the effect : you must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all , and it wo n't be much even then . high rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work . ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : after you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised : exercising the abs , obliques , other core muscles to strengthen and build them . if an exercise does n't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so , it simply is n't difficult enough to do you any good . there is no such thing as spot reducing exercise . modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction , but they still strongly imply it . why do they get away with it ? : because people never stop looking for an easy way out . the re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it . why ? : because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv , home-exercise junk that 's collecting dust
0	i returned this item , as it did n't fit my 19-pound boston terrier well at all . it was way too large for his body . `` small '' obviously means small for a larger dog instead . just be aware !
0	the bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery . i returned the item for a refund
1	i recently purchased a pair of the gripmaster hand finger exercisers in order to help build forearm strength . as i was unsure which tension would be appropriate , i bought one each of the light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) and medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i 've had them for a little more than a week now , and i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that 's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories , but i really do enjoy the grips . i leave one out on my desk at all times , and get in a little work here and there when i stop to read a document or whatnot . the gripmaster exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once , or each finger individually ( great for guitar players , i 've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each with its own spring , that can be squeezed together or one at a time . the plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit . the black rubber cushion is removable , and you can place it on either side of the grip . it 's an awesome idea , and allows for maximum versatility ! just for reference , i 'm a female , in relatively good shape , but with painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps are huge from years of tae bo , though ! ) . the 7 lb . medium/red grip is do-able , but challenging . the 5 lb . light/blue grip , on the other hand , makes for a much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , and i only feel it after a number of reps . if you 're a female and not in great shape , you 'll want to start out with the light/blue grips ( or even the extra light/yellow ones ) , and work your way up . out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the medium/red ones to start . if you 've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , do n't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the medium/red or heavy/black . although i 've only owned my gripmasters for a week or two , and ca n't personally vouch for their durability , they do seem sturdy and well-crafted . my fianc 's brother , an amateur boxer and guitar player , used his for years without a problem , so i have faith that i 'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati
0	i loved it the first 2 months i had it . with out notice the cable shredded . i called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me . it seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it . the customer service is bad and so was the product
0	i agree with the previous reviews that say hydrocoach is not accurate . instructions say to take deliberate sucks . even with that , not all ounces register . it might only register 12-16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle . i like gadgets but this $ 30 water bottle is not worth it . it would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time
1	we had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted . we investigated several brands , models , and vendors . the schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value . and , given the free shipping , amazon had the best price . so we ordered . we were not in any way dissappointed . assembly was reasonably easy . and the bikes are working out well for us
0	only about one third of the decks do not have ink makings on the backs wich makes them completely unusable
1	this clip is great and it does n't just work on utg guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns . any one with a shot gun from utg or smith and wesson should buy this ps . i 'm 1
0	this bigwheel is so poorly made . you have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on . we put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay . the seat back has cracked already and we 've only owned it one month . the tassles on the handles do n't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction . lastly , there is no breaking mechanism . anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to `` skid out '' ! keep looking .
1	it 's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic . just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you do n't want on the ground - toilet kit , socks , towels , etc . what a great idea
0	i carried this pump on my bike because is small , light and looks good . but when i had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway . this is one of several bell products i 've been dissatisfied with
1	the leek is a wonderful knife , but its sword-like point is subject to breakage . ( throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip -- which is what happened to two of my leeks ! ) fortunately , kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones , no questions asked . i just shipped them the knife , explaining what happened , and a week later got back a new knife . the knife itself opens beautifully , though i 've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and is n't that easy to depress with one hand .
1	i really like this mat by hugger mugger . the thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor . i actually purchased mine at tj maxx for $ 10 buck less than the selling price here . the color selection is very nice too . my one complaint is that i had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor . i recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat . this one in my experience , needs to be washed completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent . all in all i say this is a fine product . however , the very best mat imho are ecomats which are made from jute plant . much more expensive than this one but well worth the price
1	i am very happy with this watch . i really enjoy running and i wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury . the polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace , getting the desired benefits from my run , and helped to reduce injury . pros : works perfectly , immediately picked up by the gym equipment -- no holding on required , setting 3 zones for warm-up , running , and cool down was a snap , the audible beeps help me to know when i 'm slacking off or working too hard , the constant feedback is very motivating . cons : not many here , however , the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine . will have to see the effect of that when spring comes ! i did a lot of shopping online and i liked the polar m-61 ( $ 130 ) best but i got this one because of the lower price ( $ 80 ) . the m-61 has more features and is more fashionable ; so you may want to look at that one too
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses . the hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip .
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month , for a 5 day-a-week practice . at first i was thrilled , but at the end of my 2nd class , i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet . it 's continued to get worse and worse , 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice , and scatter on the floor around me . since i practice in a studio , it 's particularly annoying . i practice with the `` sticky '' side down , and the jute side up . the jute side is the side that flakes . practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem , but then the mat inchworms across the floor .
1	i had my knife for 10 years , and would still have it , if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever i leave the house . one night i was heading for a flight , at the airport , going thru security ; when i realized i had it on me , i had no choice but to throw it out . so had to get another one
1	this is the best wind up light you 're going to find . i advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event . our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus . i got mine at the local target store and i think it was only $ 35.00 and well worth it
0	this light worked for me when i used two d-batteries , but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions . i was also unaware that the light was fender mount , and was n't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light . i found that replacing the front reflector with the light worked ok for me , and this replacement was easy on the cruiser i have . my main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet , and the missing installation instructions
0	i 'm pretty good at getting devices up and running , but this thing is a complete mess . they do n't have the software figured out , and the instructions for trying to fix it when it 's not working are preposterously complicated . note that it comes with no directions of any kind . in fact , it arrives with an unlabeled mini-disc with no indication of what it 's for , what it is , how to use it , whether everyone needs it , or anything else . nothing but the blank disc . note that this device failing to work is a `` frequently asked question '' on the polar web site , and they have a list of about thirty things you 're supposed to `` check , '' most of which they do n't explain as far as what it is you 're checking for . ( in other words , they say `` check the [ whatever ] setting , '' but they do n't tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it . ) most of the instructions are outdated , do n't apply to current version of windows , or do n't reflect current versions of their own software . mine will be going back -- the first thing from amazon i have ever had to return
0	i had a suunto for 10 months . the face scratched very easily which was disappointing . however the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that i could stand up in the watch filled with water and died . on returning to suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! they say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose , despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m . i would never buy another suunto product . whatsmore the shop i bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either . it is also very difficult to use and you can not hear the alarm at all
0	impossible to get off after a good work out . just not for me
1	i 'm 26 and i 'm having a blast on this board ! it 's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing , because you can just grab your board and go ! i take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface . they recommend using small hills and stuff , but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline , so i prefer to stay on flat land . its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground ! the board seems to be constructed fairly well . i 've gotten to the point where i can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively , its really fun trying to master it . i 'm curious if the ripstik ( competitor board ) is better constructed since its made by razor , and they might have put more money into the design . anyways , i 've had mine for about 2 months , and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear . i 'll most likely have to replace them soon . i 'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels . that enables you to look for good deals on some wheels . i 'd also look around for the best deals on these boards . i got mine at a sports authority on sale for $ 80 , after having seen one at an fao on my visit to las vegas for $ 130 . so , if you 're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along , i 'd definately recommend this ! it 's addicting
0	i found the performance of these michelin tires to be adequate . there does n't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well . the road seems to have eaten these tires up ... i have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes -- that may say something about the quality of roads out here in hawaii . i 'm getting a flat every time i ride . my next tire will be something a little sturdier
1	i just switched from a suunto t6 to a t4 and this pc pod works seemless between the watch and pc . it is about 2x a paper clip and with the usb connection it is easy to carry . although a little pricy from the competition , if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the t4 , foot pod and pc pod work very well . down side is the software which does not support mac , come on suunto
1	great i love using this product . it goes good with xylitol too
0	if you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides ( less than 10 miles ) then this is probably not a bad bike . but , if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike , and one that will fit your body properly , go to your local bike shop and ask to see their `` hybrid '' bikes . this type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a `` road bike '' and a `` mountain bike '' or `` all terrain '' bike . they are available in several frame sizes , so you 're not stuck with `` one-size-fits-all '' , which is not good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10 . hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections . the price will range from just over $ 200 to as high as you want to go ( over $ 1500 anyway ) . as the price goes up , the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up . but even at the low end of the scale , a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride ( more miles covered per energy expended ) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides ( over 10 miles ) . if you are truly interested in covering some longer distances ( up to maybe 30-40 miles ) focus on the models that feature 700c wheels as opposed to 26-inch -- your bike shop person can explain -- and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under ( 28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement ) . the narrower tires offer less `` rolling resistance '' making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also . happy peddaling , a very experienced cyclis
0	this was a big waste of money . the first day of use , my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night . i thought maybe it was because two people were on it . a couple of monthe later i had another guest sleep on it . he had to do the same thing . ihe ended up sleeping on the couch . he thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway . again , do not waste your money ! !
0	hi , i am highly regretting buying this mat . it is too bulky to carry . and it came on sale in big 5 for half the price of amazon
0	first of all i 'd like to say how much i loved my thighmaster . i got one four months ago from a sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since . i have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil . with that said , i have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you . i was just beginning my strength training exercises and i had just done my second rep with the thighmaster and all of the sudden i heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . in two pieces ! now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind , `` wow man , my thighs must made of steel ! '' and the other more likely scenario `` wow man , it fell apart after four months , this must be an inferior product . '' anyway i e-mailed suzannesommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that i had gotten the one crumby thighmaster . i asked them if it was possible to replace it , and sadly although i only owned it four months i was told `` it may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever . '' last time i checked , four months is not anywhere near forever . a year , six months maybe , but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time i owned it , the costs outweighs the benefits . it is even less comforting that the company was n't surprised or alarmed by their product 's short lifespan . it seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com , then the product 's usage expectancy is not much more than that . it makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear , but i ca n't really afford to buy a new one every four months . i just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product , the durability is highly dubious . and the suzannesomers.com , who referred me to the manufacturer 's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum .
1	this is the best product of its kind that we could find . we bought an extension as well . all the pieces are light and easy to move . i highly recommend it . it 's a good thing amazon sells it , since toysrus is discontinuing it
1	i got this as a gift and just love it . you would n't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs . it 's fun and you can just use it while you 're watching tv . how could that be wrong
1	this was a present on our girls 3rd birthday ... she rode off an on from 2 until 9 she loved it so much we could n't wait for the battery to run out . for the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car . quick to learn how to drive it ... loud ? ? a little bit but hey , it 's a kids toy . if they did n't make noise , the kids would n't like it . great toy ! ! great value !
1	the power blocks are great if you do n't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells . changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments . in addition to the 45 pound set , you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds ( for around $ 150 )
1	this item was fairly easy to assemble . would be easier with 2 people but i put it together in less than 30 minutes . it was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well . bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip . on the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours . the carrier held up well . i had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault . it was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and i forgot to use the covers for those holes . overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to florida
1	this is a great trainer to start with , some people complain that it does n't have enough resistance . but it does for me ! i have had no problems with this trainer or any of my cycle ops products
0	this product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking , would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds . i used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off
0	excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines , , all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart ; it wasnt defective , its the material its made out of , , , the product itself is a good idea but the material is delicat
0	this bagpack is ridiculously small . believe me it can not even fit 1 college book . the description did not say that it is for elementary school kids . believe me this bag is for elementary school kids . yes ! ! ! it is that small . i 'm gave it as a present to my friends cousin , who goes to the elementary school . i am not kidding . the photo is misleading . it is unbelievably small . if you buy , you 'll see
0	i ordered this product for more than what its new price is on december 21 , 2006 as a christmas present for my mother . it did n't arrive until january 9th , and it arrived damaged ! we sent it back for a refund . on february 2nd , this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again , after i checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a return and not an exchange . we decided to set it up and see if this one was better . still damaged in another area . i have called the sharper image over ten times now over a span of 2 months . i know their customer service number by heart , and i even know their direct customer service number ( without having to go through the machine ) by heart ( call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800 ... ) . their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow ! they 've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me , so i could n't get accurate information about my order online . beware of dealing with this company . if you can , go into a sharper image store somewhere , take the thing out of its box to examine it , and only then consider bringing this product into your house . one good thing is that they do give you a full refund , tax included . at least that 's what they told me by phone today . by the way , this should be called a foldaway strider , not elliptical . it absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do
0	ummm ... . why should i pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book
0	this is my first review . i just felt the need to tell people about this product . these things do not have any resistance . i think my 11 year old niece and do about 100 reps . i 'll give it one star for comfort , but that 's about it . i 'm not even going to return them since shipping will eat half my cost away . buy something else..
0	now i am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day . yesterday morning i was driving to the dentist 's office when i realized that i had forgotten to eat . i started to have quite an anxiety attack , so i pulled over at the only available place . a gas station . nothing really caught my eye as something i would like to put inside my body . now this was no ordinary gas station . this was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter , including supreme-pizza , chicken drum-sticks , and even breakfast-style food , like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich . sure , the food smelled alright , but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil , grease , or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes . while i was peering over the counter , trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were , something to my left caught my eye . it was a golden box of something called a `` powerbar '' . the name had me sold immediately ( a food that creates power ) , and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them . `` i 'm going to eat a powerbar '' was the only thought on my mind as i purchased 4 of them on the spot . i hopped back in my vw cabrio and sped off down livernois towards the dentist 's office . i unwrapped one of the powerbars . it looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story . just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide , and for how long ? what kind of advantages would i gain ? i thought i had found my new favorite food . finally , a food that defines howard tuttleman as a person . that is , until i took my first bite . my first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat . it was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy . every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor , with an atrocious after-taste . my mouth felt like i had ingested a whole bottle of elmer 's glue , and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it . i reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar . my stomach began to feel as if i had eaten lead . i felt no extra power in my body . if anything , the powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill . i was convinced that i had simply picked a bad powerbar , so i unwrapped another one to give it a second chance . by this time i was in the dentist 's parking lot . if i went in now , i could make the appointment on time , but i had to try for more power . big mistake . the second powerbar was no different . it felt like the powerbars were fighting my stomach . i finished the second powerbar , feeling even worse . my third powerbar however was the worst of the bunch . it was a different flavor , and i nearly threw-up . i felt 20 pounds heavier . my teeth and lips felt like i had been eating drywall , and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget . i simply could not eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one , no matter how much i tried . it was time to go inside . my dentist was a little ticked-off that i was late , and got really annoyed about all of the powerbar remains stuck in my teeth . apparently i was n't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment . i felt sick for the rest of the day . i gave my dog ( morris ) the rest of the 4th powerbar to see if it would work on a dog , but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after . please beware , the name of this product is deceptive , unless it is supposed to mean that the powerbar itself is powerful , and will overpower you . later . howardtuttleman.co
0	we would like to send this item back . the construction was flimsy , and the assembly is very cumbersome . one of the pieces broke when it was being assembled . the item was inexpensive , but not worth the trouble to assemble
1	2nd suunto . 1st was a vector bought in 2000 that i abused pretty good before having to get another ( water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip ) . doubt i 'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training . highly recommended
0	amazingly , i had the exact same problem as the other reviewers . i had mine for about 4 weeks , used it maybe 4-5 times a week , when i started to hear `` snap - snap - snap '' the cable on it broke for me as well . it 's supposed to support up to 220 or 250 lbs or whatever it is . i weigh 180 . i also called the company and told them what happened , and that i wanted a replacement . i was told it was on `` back order '' and the cable would be sent out as soon as they get them in . after calling back numerous times , they continued to give me the same story . i have since returned this thing to the online store where i bought it since they were nice enough to understand the situation , and wanted to make ammends . i have yet to receive my replacement part . spartan sporting goods should be investigated thoroughly ! ! !
0	this is a piece of junk . spring broke , constantly resets itself and after less than a month it completely gave out . do n't waste your money
1	i am so glad i finally found an online source for these visors . i 've been picking them up , one or two at a time , from street fairs for probably 20 years now . you can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos , because they are so light and comfortable , and they keep the sun out of your eyes ( or the rain ) . and these particular visors , here on amazon , had good snaps , too
1	i bought this as a christmas gift for my brother in law , but after he opened it , we all tried it on . i have very fragile , long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when i 'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off . this one came on and off so easily , without any hair-pulling
1	my three sons and i saw these pogos demonstrated at the cleveland x games a couple years ago . we could not beleive what we saw . this is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen . for the money , it 's a tremendous value , and their customer service is the best i have come across . they also make a high ( er ) octane version called the flybar 1200 which supports larger riders . for adults ( yes , adults will love this thing ! ) or kids this is a `` must have '' this christmas . my youngest son ca n't wait for their next model ( flybar 400 ) due in '07 i believe ... an absolute , 100 % , thumbs-up ! jim woods , akron , ohi
1	work out every muscle in your body with this excellent workout bench . it has a lot of features for its price , and it 's very easy to assemble
0	i received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son . it was one of the most frustrating toys he 's had . the handle requires too much strenght to press down , so he was not able to operate it alone . he could press it down only when standing up ( using his body weight ) , but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way : he had to lean and crouch . the noise that the balls make is rather loud ( in my consideration ) and can irritate the adults after a while , too . because my son was already walking , this static toy got very little attention . the positive features : it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright
0	i enjoy the elliptical.. i really do , especially when i first received the box . it had no instruction manual ! ! ! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together !
1	very impressive , though it 's a bit big for my two-year-old . he ca n't reach the peddles yet , but manages to push himself around without too much trouble . i think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old , or a big two-year-old . seems solidly built , very sturdy/stable and sporty looking
0	rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family 's emergency kit ( and ecologically smart to boot ) . while this product is satisfactory for , say , a science demonsration on the faraday principle , its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited . to its credit : this flashlight was meant to last , and will stand extremes of water and temperature . when dropped into water , it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval . it 's so sturdy tha , it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you ca n't say that about too many products . shake this light for a while , and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time . while you may read claims of up to one or two hours , a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes , and then you shake again . and again . as long as you do n't mind the repetition , the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency . but do n't entertain thoughts that you 'll be able to read , find small objects , or perform any kind of detail work . if you do n't have a chance to compare this to its better competition , you might not know that say , the sherpa xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by . while no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you 'll find in a traditional flashlight , your options are brighter if you stay away from the diamond gen . invest in something more powerful and you 'll find that a flashlight 's usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight was disappointing , and useless in any practical context
1	i use these for mma type workout on bags blocking pads , and they have worked well . they give good protection even when hitting hard . i have not had the problem with dye fading that i noticed with some other gloves . overall i would reccomend , about the same or less than other gloves from everlast , century , ect and just as good quality.fyi there are a lot of visible seams where the pads `` pockets '' are attached ( especially on the fingers ) that you ca n't see well in the picture advertised . i do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this , i would n't use them to spar as these would tend to cut . ( most people would use `` fighting gloves '' to spar anyway , but just trying to be helpful ! !
1	the gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding . i took it with me on vacation to florida , and two of my friends -- one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints -- saw it , started using it and loved it . so i ordered two more !
1	what can i say ? if you 're a steelers fan then you must have these ! ! ! !
0	this `` key hider '' would n't fool my 18 month old ! with a very visible seam on the bottom , it 's obvious this thing opens . you can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic ! awful , awful , awful
1	my baby does n't go gaga over it , but she does like the moving picture on the ceiling occasionally . it 's a great product , though , so do n't depend on my baby 's tastes
0	my son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year . this year , he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250 , even though he has a fairly nice swing . using this device for two weeks , he suddenly ca n't hit anything . i pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60 ! the problem with this device is that the ball does n't drop like a pitched ball , so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal . i 'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son 's swing and confidence . do n't get me wrong , the kids love it . the entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it . it 's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you could n't otherwise . beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and do n't let it replace live pitching . fun-factor is a 5 , but as far as a training device , i have to question its value
1	i just got this from khol 's . they had it on sale for $ 11.99 . when i saw it , there were plenty on the shelves . i was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape . there was a try me sign on there . so in my boredom , while waiting for my ride , i read the directions on the back and actually tried it . it was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light ' . i 'm glad i checked out the aisle . i 've never seen anything so cool . it 's very simple to wind-up the flashlight . the ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily . it 's not difficult to follow the instructions . anyone could do it . the lightbulb is led so according to my internet research led : `` leds have an extremely long life span , twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs. `` the design is actually very nice to the touch . it 's padded with some nice rubber grip , so its not unpleasant to hold . it 's not very heavy at all . it 's about the size of a male 's electric shaver . i bought it at khol 's for more money than its listed here on amazon . i got it today and i showed my younger siblings . they loved it , too . basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand . it 's really simple to use and its a comfortable design . i plan on going back to get more tomorrow . )
0	we bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from pennsylvania to florida . we did n't use it on the way there , but on our way home , we put two medium sized suitcases in it . we barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams . fortunately ( or unfortunately due to the color ) , we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us , so we were able to repair the bag as we drove . after another 100 miles , we had to stop again and repair the bag . we drove from florida to hilton head , having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape . from hilton head to pennsylvania , the bag started to look like a nightmare of black , criss-crossed with yellow . the last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle , having to stop to fix the bag . the company has a 30 day return policy , but we missed that by a day , having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks , and they would n't even work with us on it .
0	i recently purchased the stamina elliptical . it took me a day and a half to put together . the meter did n't work so i called customer service and they sent another one out immediately . it makes a lot of noise and it 's not very sturdy . i would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble . i would n't recommend this product .
1	i absolutely love this watch , and amazons fast and reliable delivery of the product didnt hurt at all . i mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if i was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that i have it i wouldnt know what i would do without it . a great purchase
1	hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition . thanks
1	the item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says . it is great
0	i bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and i was very excited to try my new product . when i got home i was in for a shock . there were at least sixteen screws , locks , and washers in a little bag . in addition to that , there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together . all in all , it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it 's filled with water , it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout . i need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches i throw on it . for the amount of money that i paid , this bag should have been put together for me . i will keep the bag and put it outside . if somebody steals it , they will be doing me a favor . next time i will go with what i know and buy a wavemaster from century , now that is an awesome product
1	this product is fabulous for peace of mind . the kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours . i bought some for my sisters and they love them too . as far as 72 hour kits go , this is a lot of bang for your buck
1	... so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand , not to safe . missing file holder is the only reason i do n't give it five stars
1	i was spending the day at home with a cold . the doorbell rang . at my doorstep , was a large box . `` already ? i just ordered it a few days ago . '' i shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light ( it 's only 52 pounds ) box up the stairs . a sharp knife , a pair of nail clippers , thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later , i had my extreme pilates put together . on first impressions , the mat graphic is cheesy , and the frame looks flimsy . however , this is n't just a pilates trap table : the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment , and are less likely to get in the user 's way . the push through bar wo n't drop if you let go of it , because the metal is engineered not to slide . there are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar . overall , this is a safer machine than the original . when you try to use it , though , there are a few problems : i 'm 5'4 '' and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor . the springs are light , and i would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame . it 's not clear which springs are the leg springs . the lack of clips is just silly . that said , i can do everything i can do on a trap table . i did the cat , swan and saw with the push through bar , leg circles with the springs , chest expansion and roll down with the bar , and even the magician 's series to finish . that kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out . i could hear the springs ( real springs , not bungee cords ! ) all was ( briefly ) right with the world . this is an amazing piece of equipment for the price . three caveats : not for taller men ; it 's just too small . not for serious athletes ; not enough resistance . not for people with children if you ca n't lock it away ; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with .
1	i am a year-round bicycle commuter in chicago who teaches classes on bike safety and riding with children . i ride all the time at night , often with my kids in tow . we bought this as part of a set for my son 's bike two years ago . it is absolutely phenomenal in it 's visibility , durability , and ease of use ! i can not recommend it enough . i have something of a fetish about visibility when we ride our bikes at night . i have bought just about every blinkie light out there . this is my favorite , along with the blackburn mars tailight ( with 7 leds including two amber side lights ) . mind you , the mars is more than 3x the cost of this bell light . pros -- *extremely visible *multiple flasher modes *easy on/off feature for when you are locking up in a public place *long battery life cons -- *the red shield can fall off when the bike is dropped or hits a hard bump . we solved this problem by putting a small piece of electric tape on the top edge
1	found the edge 284 easy to asemble and use . it was less expensive than comparable models i checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and i did n't have to figure out how to get it home ; it was delivered for free
0	it helps with digestion just like any other multi-digestive vitamin . it did n't really help me output a lot of energy . i did n't get the jitters or anything like that , however i would think twice before purchasing .
1	it does the job ; i have n't had it long enough to attest to its durability . too bad the shipping cost more than the product
0	i purchased this item based on the picture . i did n't want a cheap looking air-hockey table because i planned to keep it for a long time . the price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was $ 150 . arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward , but not too bad , but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling . i do n't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier , but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents . i could n't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box , so i hoped for the best . when i opened the box , there was no obvious shipping damage , however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging . the assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages . there was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly , however , the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible . assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well . i was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components . alignment was poor , making final assembly difficult , and there was excessive adhesive all over the place , even on the playing surface . i was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping . the table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship , but does n't include shipping . as the table surface is the largest component , i 'm imagining it would cost most of the $ 150 shipping fee to have it replaced . at this point , i 'm not willing to sink any more money into this table . after the table was set up , i was hoping it would at least play well . i was disappointed there too . there are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult . i 've never seen anything like them on other tables . by the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for , it fly 's off the table . in fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing . maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface , but it still ruins the game . there were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived . they all played about one game and now the table sits unused . all in all , this has been my most disappointing online purchase . i guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy
1	so many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it ! that 's not what it 's supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is . my friend who is probably about 250 lbs did n't even pop it
0	usually puzzle mats come in 6 pieces . you can visit walmart and they have same type ther
0	the product picture and description do not match actual item sent . if you look on ebay , it is the same item that malibu wholesale starts bidding at .99 . it does not weigh 6 # , but actual weight of item is around 12 oz . it is cheaply made and not designed to last
0	i bought this bike thinking since jeep put its name on it then it should be a great , tough , rock solid ride ! boy was i wrong ! not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy , its mechanics are worst part . after taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally , 10 of its gears still do n't work . now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job , let me tell ya , i stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still did n't work . overall , i 'd have to give this bike two thumbs down . you 're better off buying a bike from walmart
0	these are not 100 % plastic but they are paper please do not buy these if you think you are getting plastic cards .
0	this bed was a real disappointment from the beginning . we actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it . it 's just a fabric cover , perhaps with an extra layer of material , but it ca n't be foam . maybe only 1/4 '' thick at most . then , after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4 '' rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally . bad bed
1	i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest , and it 's everything i hoped it would be . i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts , and this vest has proved to be a good choice . the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body . the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks . the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement . i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting , though it does hamper some bending movements . the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter . i am well pleased with my purchase
0	this gun is a very bad gun ! ! ! ! ! if you are from the ages of 6-10 i would get it but if not dont . i got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet . trust me this gun is a piece of junk . just poket to shipping and buy something else ! !
0	hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it
0	absolutely no use to me whatsoever . next
0	this item was not very good , setup instructions poor , lighting poor , can not view screen at night , forget it
1	lightweight , well made . excellent kayak paddles . i highly recommend these
1	i own several pelican cases . when i saw the options for cases for my macbook , i knew that this case would be just what i needed . the macbook 13.3 '' fits snugly inside the case . the case says 13 '' notebooks , but the extra width of the macbook is accepted . the case is shipped with small foam large and small spacers . i used the large spacers but placed them inside the top lid of the case so that the notebook screen would n't be opened when i opened the pelican . i do n't have any worries now when i toss my notebook into a backpack and travel . i felt uneasy about having to take my notebook out of my pelican 1510 carry-on case when gate-checking my carry-on luggage for small regional jets
1	great value - great taste for sports drink-fare . this is the only drink i use these days on the trails . very easy on the system ! no bad after taste . the 4.5 lbs cans are an awesome value .
1	however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out of thant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently
1	of all the many swiss army knives i own , this is the most used . not only is the pocket pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean 's pocket , its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling , paper cutting , and a whole host of tasks
1	smith wesson is an american arms maker . the flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight . the more important aspect is that it uses two aa batteries , which are easy to find and economical . it came with two energizer aa batteries . three white leds are bright enough for general purposes . i keep it in my car 's glove box .
1	i 'm currently in iraq and i ordered this bike , although it took a while to get it ( not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal ) i was happy when finally i recieved it . i had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers . after my small mishap i was on my way riding in 30 mins or less . i 've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather . during the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and i had no issues with paint or the mechanics period . now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often ; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place . i 've taken this bike threw rocks , dirt , asphalt , and plenty of sand . after a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day i took it out of the box . overall i am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the states with me when my tour is up
0	the suction cups do not work on many toilet seats . though the idea is great , save your money unless you have some to burn
1	we tried out the cheap barbie skates first just to make sure that our girl will enjoy skating . after she puts on the k2 , she was able to skate so much faster and smoother .
0	i did not pay head to the other reveiws , and bought this bike anyway . the first day i had it , the back fender snapped off , leaving sharp points exposed . sadly , we had to tell our 4 year old , on his birthday , that he could not ride the bike . so we returned it and got another one . not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one , than the `` exhaust pipes '' came off , leaving a very sharp screw exposed , then the tire came off and the rim broke , becuase it was plastic as well . also , the vinyl on the seat started to come apart . at this point , i had to return it , and fight to get my money back ! ! it was a week after it had been delivered to the house . i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk . please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike !
1	you wo n't believe how many exercises you can do on this home gym . it takes up very little space and there 's even a diet plan included
0	the railings on the schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches ! it was impossible to assemble . with any quality control at all , these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory . human error is then not a factor . this is a defect that should never happen . schwinn/nautilus has zero quality control . that is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards . you are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other schwinn or nautilus product . with zero quality control , no telling what else can prove to be wrong . and though the warranty says `` 1 year on parts '' , the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts . so what is the 1 year warranty on labor ? nothing , obviously . i wish i never had purchased this product , myself
1	got this for my 4 year old niece 's birthday , she is really into dora so she was happy with it . the skootskate is simple to put together , but not necessary the most durable materials . then again , you get what you pay for . i got this on the friday sale for ten bucks , along with some books so that there is no shipping charge . my niece is happy , so ca n't complain much about that .
0	i realize the price being so low that i would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine . i did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not . since it does not fit over both tires , the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit . i have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable . my tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains . even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading ! very disappointed
0	i 've been using harbinger since mid-90 's and all of them share the same problem : after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag , a recurring odor after handwash , machinewash , sun exposure . i am embarassed to use them . this particular model is in its second year of use at first , they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non-slippery grip ; sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff . now that some rubber has fallen they feel better . as of now they are dismembering at the seams , they still smell bad ( 3-4 working sessions a week , & lt ; 2 hours , good care ) . i am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe gofit or valeo or nike . try neoprene perhaps
0	do not buy this magazine ! ! ! ! it has been falsely advertised . it does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30 . it is the exact same magazine that comes with the high power steyr . i bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today i feel completly ripped off
0	overall , not terribly happy with this units user interface and design . the spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as `` sw1 '' sw2 '' etc , but they are not labeled as such on the device . you toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ( `` tr '' `` ch '' what ? ? ) just an unfreindly interface all around . look for a better unit .
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating . i would recommend a different mat . cheer
0	i would easily be able to rip this box open . i refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this . any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly
1	the thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install , fast delivery , on a scale from 1 to 10 , this whole transaction is a 10+++++ .
0	bought this machine , based on the reviews on amazon . it was okay at first . i workout regularly with tapes , outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week . by the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain . we tried to see if we can fix it , but it did n't work . i ca n't use it anymore , mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere . you get what you paid for ! ! ! now i 'm looking to invest in something more sturdy . if you exercise once every month this is the machine for you !
0	they say it will be delivered in its original carton , but they do n't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones . the box came with two bright yellow strapping bands , and certainly looked sealed when i signed for it at delivery . later that evening , when i cut the bands i was surprised when the top lifted open , the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open . i cut the box open and started laying the parts out . when i pulled the carton containing the console out , the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam . every thing else looked undisturbed . i pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned , the bubble wrap was torn , and the six screws to mount it were missing . i called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws , and i called amazon to tell them what was going on , i would have sent it back , but i had cut the box open and do n't think there is any way i could cram it all back together . just look the box over carefully when they deliver it , the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed . they sure fooled me into accepting a opened box .
1	these bands were recommended by our son 's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them . but they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear . our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked . before using these bands , his legs and arms were covered with bites . we are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others
1	i went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what i should get . i need a good unit that 's going to last . this one was one of the models i kept seeing and hearing good things about . i loved it in the stores , but amazon had a better price , and i did n't mind waiting a week to get it . i 've been using it now for about 3 weeks , and i can see why i kept hearing good things about it . it 's really sturdy , and there was a lot of attention put on the little details . everythings right where it should be , it 's very quiet , and very sturdy . i 'd reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day .
1	i am very happy with this product . it 's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it . i had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over . but my brother fiddled with it and discovered that ( unlike the rope in the picture ) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it 's not right up against the handle . so now i would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it ( and the sellers should have known that ) .
1	the bowflex is one of the most amazing machines i have ever used . with its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part , you can do just about any exercise you want to do . i completely recommend this if you do n't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home . one disclaimer , do n't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights . if you are an avid free-weight lifter , you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench . the powerrods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them . thus , if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance , but only move the power rods through their first half of bend , you are n't getting 100 pounds of resistance . also , when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench , you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where , even if you bend them all the way , you are n't getting full resistance . do n't get me wrong , i love this thing ; i 've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing . i work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session , only because i do n't have the time to make it to the gym . get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and do n't have a lot of space to fit other equipment . make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs . experiment with ideas on different exercise movements . more than anything , this piece of equipment is a blast to use , have fun with it
0	this bench is a bit of a joke , unfortunately . having put the bench together myself , i can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on : it 's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two very small pieces of metal , balanced over the main structure . i feel foolish for buying this bench . between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a maximum total weight of 300lbs -- including you and the weight you 're lifting , i think it would be a mistake to purchase this . the maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet . it 's narrow . and small .
1	i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown ( the kid , not me ) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins . as for age requirements , the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age . i say that 's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her/him how to fall correctly ... ie , not on unpadded body parts like your hands ... and red works for boys and girls ... so if you 're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it 's double the price stick with this..
0	the accessories that come along with this nice are great , albeit somewhat impractical ( who 's going to use a slingshot , anyway ? ) , but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle . survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality , but this handle has a cheap , brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage . it 's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress , which makes this blade a dangerous one to use . do not buy this knife , or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived , it was very scuffed up and scratched . it also had a flat spot on it . i returned it for a replacement , which i got , and it was in the same condition . also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before . i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it . we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb . medicine ball and the same outcome . definitly not happy with it
1	combining the simple , easy workout with the eating plan , my body changed , what seemed like , instantly . i highly recommend this . i '' m on week 5 and have already dropped two pants sizes
1	the swim belt i ordered was awesome . perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim . the great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy . take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder . it also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim
0	i bought both the nordic gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens . neither product provides adequate heat . the batteries work ; but you get only a tiny bit of warmth . i see from the other reviews that my complaint is common . i wish i had read the reviews before buying
1	this bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use . it is simple to install . works great . is easy to navigate . and , is actually kind of fun to use . i love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed , distance , etc . and , when i 'm whipping down the trail i really like to look down and see how fast i 'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons
0	our three year old twins received two of these cars for christmas . the joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on christmas day ! my husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that , the other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we are stuck with two broken cars and one that does work , but are wondering when that one will break too ! i need to mention that the kids were not particularly rough with the cars ; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior . the controls are cheap and will break eventually . the cars are very loud , but on the positive side , the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them . i would definitely not recommend this product
0	this step sucks . if you are used to doing step classes at the gym , you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step . i did n't know it was a smaller step or i would n't have bought it . it is hard to adjust to the shorter step , especially when doing a turn step or v step . it ends up being very close to a basic step . i was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up , that i was cheating myself out of a full workout . do not buy this , if you 're used to the step at the club . i feel like it 's more dangerous on this , and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor . if you already know that you like to step , buck up and buy the club size step , even though it is twice the price of this one . otherwise , do n't buy anything
1	this is one of the best racquets i have ever purchased . ever since i used this racquet i have been playing better . the racquets smooth motion makes it suitable for people of all skill levels
1	this bar is great when used properly , i.e . make sure the door is closed when you use it . i was surprised how well it worked , much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches .
1	i burned my hand , but it was ok . i got to keep 3 of my fingers . they work fine , but they 're a bit too hot
0	the suit will make you sweat if that 's what you are looking to do . i had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs , but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam . i was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine . it will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses , but buy something more substantial for a serious workout . you truly do get what you pay for
1	this will keep the big little things from floating in your water . only works in clear water .
0	i will never deal with this company again ! my product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun . it would not work after we cleaned it and i got no response from the company.i had to throw away the gun along with my money.i have enjoyed amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with.thank
0	i purchased 5 of these for christmas presents . i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time . number 1 : this was dead in the box . so were numbers 2 , 3 and 4 . i did n't bother with number 5 . every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested . speaking of instructions , they tell you to `` make certain the light is off before attempting to charge . '' there is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is . real junk , says `` hummer '' , made in china and all five are going back
1	the good : * i could n't find these in bricks-and-mortar stores at all , and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor i trust . * the 1-lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight , with the cuff on or off . * i have been using them for about two weeks , and the effect on my workout - and my legs - is tremendous . the bad : * the cuffs are `` adjustable '' with two long velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle . no matter how carefully i wrap them , i just ca n't get them as tight as i 'd like . straps which wrap double back through d-rings would have been much more useful . * the cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet . cushioned by gel or not , i ca n't exactly call that `` comfortable . '' i 'm not sure whether this is specific to this brand , or typical of ankle weight cuffs . overall : i do wish i 'd been able to try these and some other brands before i purchased them . however , i 'm delighted to have found them and with the results i 'm seeing
0	i ordered a product that showed a correct hinged replacement fixture for my igloo cooler but when it arrived what showed up was a completely different product of lesser stature and quality . i will never order from them again
0	this is a $ 22 tee ball ? maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place , since these should cost about $ 2 at your local sporting goods store . maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package ( but it does n't say that clearly on the page ) . bottom line is do n't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue
0	this product is not fit for use in any circumstance . it definately looks great - but thats it ! the product ( ca n't call it a gun ) broke in the first 5 hours of use , not combat , play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters . i am extremely dissapointed with the quality of the product . i wrote two letters to the seller/manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet . not surprised . my son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it was well worth it . we did not repeat buy and wo n't . learn from our mistake
1	my kids love it , they play for hours in the garage . it keeps them away from the television and computer in the winter . they are also exercising while having fun
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two . after applying one vial , it seemed even worse than before . ( tread `` catches '' as i walk . ) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable . ( still not great . ) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality
0	i had a different experience than the other reviewer . i would also consider myself a beginner golfer , but the medicus has not worked for me . it might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time , but if you are trying to improve your swing it does n't help . you develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge , but it is still a bad swing . i heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it , but not good for beginners .
0	it 's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up . but what was worse was that after i owned it for two weeks , the thing stopped working ! it was never dropped or damaged in anyway , it just stopped . the display just faded away and would n't work again even with a new battery . this one was such a waste of money , i 'll definately buy a different brand next time
0	i purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down . next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy . the first time the wind picked up , it blew the whole thing apart . so for a one time use it is okay ... the money spent on this was a waste . it also looked in places like it had already been repaired . ( seconds ) as in 2nd class merchandise
0	i 'm sure the mat would have been fine , but they mixed up my order , and this company does not refund shipping , which was almost the price of the mat -- lame
0	okay , here 's the bottom line . if you 're just getting into airsoft , this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot . but if you 're actually looking to get into the sport competitively , look for a classic army or tokyo marui aug . it will be more expensive , but it will be quality . the number one rule of the airsoft world is : you get what you pay for . this is a cheap gun , and it 's going to perform like a cheap gun . if you 're looking for a decent cheap gun , let me recommend the utg warhawk , utg mp5 or some of the cyma mp5 line
1	i was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $ 100 . it recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in denali national park in alaska . the weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents , but the price and features make up for that . it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage . the two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy . the vestibules are very handy for storing your boots . on colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though . overall a good purchase .
0	it is unfortunate to have to write such a review , but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that i am compelled to do so . the unit was received new , but the hinges were already rusted , the closure hasp broken ( poorly designed and executed ) , the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp . made in china , this stove demonstrates no attention to detail , quality control or materials . i own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory , much less , off the design table . further , the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor , if not downright unacceptable ( in major ways ) . as this unit was new in the box , i can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the us manufacturer has for customers . save yourself cut hands and returns , buy another brand
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat ( a shortened m-4 ) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . why by a gun from these guys ? if it arrives broken , you pay to ship it back . want a refund ? you pay a 15 % restocking fee . take a pass on airsplat .
1	i could not believe how well this product works . it is hard to imagine that this is not a more known product in the market . you do n't need much to make things sweet , which makes the dollar last longer
0	these guns r the worst ! one of them broke when i dropped it and the other just broke and i dont no y. they r also very weak and the accuracy is terrible ! they might be ok if you are new at air soft and dont wan na use em 4 wars of anything thow
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month , for a 5 day-a-week practice . at first i was thrilled , but at the end of my 2nd class , i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet . it 's continued to get worse and worse , 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice , and scatter on the floor around me . since i practice in a studio , it 's particularly annoying . i practice with the `` sticky '' side down , and the jute side up . the jute side is the side that flakes . practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem , but then the mat inchworms across the floor .
1	we already have a few of these but not enough to go around . they are a lot of fun and hold up well . a good buy
1	this gun shoots hard and fast ! ! ! this is a metal gear box so it last forever ! ! ! this is a must buy ! ! ! believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good ! !
1	extra heavy , somewhat difficult to assemble . good quality . will hold 24 rods but not with reels attached , more like 12 rods/reel combos
0	i bought these skates for my daughter from sport authority . since we both wear the same size , i decided i would try and skate in them after my daughter . she complained the wheels would not roll and when i tried to loosen them with a skate tool , they would n't loosen at all . i tried to skate in them as well and i almost fell on my face . i was n't expecting the same quality as my professional skates , but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely !
0	i had great hope for this item after reading reviews , but found that it did n't function as described , and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually ... and i have tiny hands . it 's a great idea , but needs a re-design before i could use it .
1	this item is such a great value . everything included is a basic necessity . for anyone interested in getting into boxing , i suggest this set as your first purchas
0	like other users , i found the light output substandard . i bought it specifically as an emergency light source . if i really needed this light , there really would be an emergency ! absolutely pathetic
0	this bench went together quickly . all the parts fit well and the instructions were decent . anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems . there are a few steps where a second set of hands help . craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent . however , this bench is simply not built for much weight . it will wobble and flex . it does n't feel safe at all . if you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench . there are alot better benches out there for just a little more money
0	make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer . it does n't work with every bike , it did n't with mine . i called allegro medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying i cant return it unless it is defective . so now i have a bike trailer and a bike that do n't work together and i 'm out $ 85.00 . horrible
0	i received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly . but i was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball . it no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper ! unless you hit the nylon target , you have lost a ball ! i may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if i miss the target
0	though the concept of a heart rate monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient , the mio is of absolutely no use during your workout . you have to stop your activity ( be it running , biking or walking ) to measure your current heart rate , as your hand has to be steady . the calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories .
1	finger tips a bit too long ... not a problem just turned them down , very comfortable , relieves stress on fingertips and palm ... nice design and fit . hard to beat for this price
0	i was going to give this product a `` 3 '' because the trays acutally quite nice . just as the previous reviewer , i love handing out chips in them . however , i re-read the name of the product , and i had to change my vote to a `` 1 '' . these chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating , not only during game play but afterward when i 'm trying to store them
0	i got one of these because it was only a penny . i used it several times with only a slight crack that i later cemented . later i used it again , and , while cocking it back , the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces . the gun is fun for about the first few tries then it 's prone to jamming up . even though it was only a penny , it was $ 4.99 shipping . i 'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market . i 'm not very satisfied , but i 'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking . but after i say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars , at a critical point . i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket . but still i think the basket is a piece of junk . plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork , which limits your height of your handlebars . the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable . i ca n't recommend this basket . buy a basket from your local sports authority or something . thanks darealdeal
0	this is a useless product . i do not exercise much , and i do not even get a burn from this machine . the dvd is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone . it looks like it is low budget !
1	to keep the active mom going when baby arrives . no need to change your routine just because baby is here , pass along the healthy habit
1	this gaget does actually work if used correctly . the last guy doesnt have any idea of what he is talkinga about . simple theory , sweat more in the target area loss fat in the same area . wear this when you work-out but all day along with a good diet and it will work . several of my client have had excellent results
1	i am very happy with the trainer . most impressively , it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer . i can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family . i ride about 30 minutes a day on it ... . it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program
1	our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out . then we found this one got it for her for christmas and she *loves* it . after 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with no training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so . it is all due to this bike . i never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike with training wheels before . and when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels , there were lots of tears they screamed for their training wheels back ! and their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we did n't even have to help her . now we are loaning out the scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too ! in fact i just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals i 'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too , the way that he speeds around on the scoot ! it was well worth the purchase
0	i bought this exact one maybe a year ago . about 2 months later it just collapses . set up is not the onlt thing that is hard , actully trying to get a high jump is very difficult . this is a little kids toy but most little kids do n't just like baby bounces do they ? i would not recommend this trampoline to anybody
1	the product itself is good and feels safe when i use it . the assembly instructions could use some help . but i eventually figured out what the pictures meant .
0	i was attracted to the park sun pb-pro pitchback pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage . the first unit i recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting , hing pieces , and hardware missing . i promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything i needed to assemble the unit . unfortunately , the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably . after juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging , i ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces . on one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges ; on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces . also , the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing , and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together . the packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents . there was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing , particularly at the tube ends . nice idea , poor execution .
1	this thing is great . built tough as nails . there are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve . you wo n't be disappointed in the results if you stick with it . get it . use it .
0	if you need a `` starter '' or `` disposable '' bike carrier , this might be okay , but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes . good parts : cheap , $ 99 bad parts : 1 . cheap 2 . the adapter for a 2 '' reciever hitch is horrible , you 'll have to shim it , jury-rig something , or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one . 3 . way too much sway , which is obvious as you put it together . turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern . multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps . would need to rig something . 4 . straps holding the bikes . cheap , rough on your bike , and not very tight . in summary , if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks , it might be worth it , but out of the box , i would n't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it
0	the suggested 1 to 2 drops does n't sweeten and more makes coffee bitter
0	i was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat . i got neither . it is pretty , but that is about it .
0	while i like the functions this offers , the screen is a bit hard to read when riding . also , the instructions are n't very easy to follow . for example , it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions do n't say how to convert to miles/hour . i would probably not buy this again
0	this tool will not take an edge , either with a grinder or a file . it is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems , which has undesirable consequences for your hand . if you are looking for a useful tool , keep looking
1	i have 6 children . 4 could n't ride bikes . the scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling . the kids feel safer because they can hop off easier . now , 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon . great toy
0	i have an ics m4a1 . i am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums i am registered to have said on this . i am registered on arnies , airsoft core , and airsoft retreat . 1 ) this gun is from a very , very unreliable company ( well ) , so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one . this is common knowledge among the airsoft community . 2 ) lets say you buy 4 of these guns ... each of them costing 100 dollars . even over a 5-10 year span , that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly . people who have skirmished with an lpeg ( low-powered electric gun ) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an aeg that shoots 330 fps with .2g ( standard for companies like toyko marui , ics , classic army , g , airsoft elite ) . the one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made . 3 ) the gearbox ( part of gun that fires bbs ) broke on mine . in short , it has a metal gearbox , made of the cheapest metal known to man . the purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money . it is very , very weak . definitely not worth it . 4 ) the `` hop-up '' on this gun is non-existant . the fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to bbs to increase range and accuracy . effective range of this- 50 feet ( not meters ) . effective range of my ics m4a1 ( with a aftermarket tightbore added ) is 150 feet . 5 ) this gun will get laughed at . some children walk into an organized skirmish with this lpeg , telling people that it will own all others , and they will cry home when players with real aegs destroy them . i suppose it is fine for backyard wars , but who on earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars ? 6 ) the cost does not equal quality . if you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun ( light , laser , ect ) , then account for shipping from china , then the packaging costs ( pre-molded styrofoam ) , you will realize that this gun is very , very cheaply made . you do not want to be spending so much for so little quality . the laser itself can sell for 20 dollars . put it short , it is not worth it
0	just disappointed is all ... . was n't what i expected and it 's very cheaply made ... .
1	the best thing about this lantern is that it is rechargeable . no extra batteries needed , just plug it in and go . it is a quality lantern that is bright , and functional . overall , i am very pleased and i would recommend this product to my friends .
0	these noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old , she bonks herself with them . my toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them . they make fairly interesting noises , but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size . no one really plays with them much . i would not recommend them .

0	this thing is being advertised as dance dance revolution . it is not ddr . it is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny . my daughter plays a ddr at afterschool and loves it . she received this for christmas , tried it once and gave up within five minutes . she said , it says fifty songs but it plays just one . well , the 50 `` songs '' all sound the same . they are not `` radio '' or `` stereo '' quality , rather just computer generated noise . totally awful . having tried it myself , i am very disappointed and do n't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance . total waste of money and total false advertising . this company should be investigated . believe the poor reviews and skip this product ! ! ! !
0	this machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled , i could n't believe it . my advice would be to avoid this product
1	bike has very nice detailing , paint has a nice shine , really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean , great buy !
1	i have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years . the price has been gradually coming down each year . i was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at amazon of all places . these fit well , adjust easily and are extremely durable . i swim 6 days each week and i can easily get over a year of use from each pair . typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses , when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools . keep them stored safely so the lenses do n't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you 'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase
0	after unpacking and assembling the ab chair deluxe , i noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold . the digital read out display lite up all 8 's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries . every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit . i still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective . get a ab chair , just not this one

0	i bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure . i found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to . i 'm used to a 60 sec sweep . and the minute hand was difficult to read . i really had to check to see if i was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min .
1	our card group of ten people play `` president '' which requires three decks and a large table . this unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever 's turn it is . i added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other
0	i am a personal trainer and i was asked by a friend to check this `` elliptical '' strider out for them . i was suspicious from the price thinking that it really could n't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway . as i suspected , this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago . except for the tony little tv glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone . there is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are no gliders in health clubs . with ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running . this of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past . also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion . i 've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing . but it is a question of time . you could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical . i 'm not promoting any one brand and i have no ax to grind , except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like sharper image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products . the reason elliptical machines are called `` elliptical '' is that the user 's foot goes through an elliptical path . gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum . if you do n't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist . this is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals . my advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical .
0	i have had two of these units ( sg2 and an sg4 ) and all i can say is `` do n't believe the hype '' . while the units are an unbelievable concept on tv and work ( note : when they work ) great , the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by skygolf is , by itself , sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena . just to relay my experience ( and keep in mind i have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units ) , it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original sg2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software ( ie-endless restarts ) . when the sg2 was stolen at an event , i purchased an sg4 to obtain the next generation of the product . since the january 2 , 2007 , purchase date , i have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours ( including one saturday morning , prior to a sunday event , when they requested i attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5am ( no , that is not a typing error on my part ! ) california time ) . i have purchased/received ( skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation ) and returned three sg4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged . i have attempted to download the software and access the website via the sg4 on five different computers and every single service pack of microsoft windows 2000 . even after i forwarded skygolf the computer log to show them the problem ( software error ) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational . at this point , all i can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating ( to echo another review ) it is to deal with the people behind the product . no product , no matter how fabulous in concept , is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation . good luck to you if you purchase the product . i hope your experience is better than mine .

1	this is a great little camp kitchen , just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site . i have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it 's massive in size and more suited for extended stays , the guide gear camp kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays . it 's compact both set up and in it 's carrying bag , it 'll take up hardly any space while traveling . perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table . the hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food , paper supplies , etc . this is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you 'd need to enjoy the great outdoors . i highly recommend it ... buy it , try it ... . you wo n't be dissapointed
0	we bought two pairs of these ( his and hers - sizes large and regular ) direct from the manufacturer . the gloves in both sets were of different sizes , and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use . too bad , because the concept is great .
1	great item , and great shipping . recieved product in a timely manner .
0	this nightmare was so disappointing ! it was hard to assemble , and the instructions were minimal and illegible . it is an overpriced piece of junk . in addition , the net for the hoop was not in the box , and the hoop was put on backwards . my son was so upset . i would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional , with proper communication , and some info how to contact them if there was a problem , because there will definitely be a problem !
1	if you are n't prepared to use the swing setter a couple of times a week for ca . 5-10 minutes each time , you probably wo n't get the benefit it has to offer . the cd and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis . the effects it has had on me are as follows : a ) despite my impression that my grip was solid , it forced me to assume a stronger , more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball ; b ) it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger ( which i used to be when i was playing better ) by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing ( especially the backswing ) and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to `` cast '' . the quality of construction is excellent ; i ca n't imagine wearing it out although , i see that the magnets can lose strength over time . my main problem has been with a looping swing - inside to outside . so far , the swing setter does not seem to address this problem ; i can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time . i would think some of the other `` hinged '' swing trainers would be a better help with this problem . i do recommend the swing setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline , it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off-season . good luck
0	in less than 3 months the seals did n't work because the velcrow came apart . everything inside gets wet . poor product
0	this stuff has a very strong smell -- like wd-40 or something . if you can stand the smell , you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt . i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless , like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought . but it is n't odorless . it really stinks . i do n't like that permeating smell in my house , especially in my workout room . i recommend the lifespan 100 % silicone lubricant . it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive , but it 's the good ( odorless ) stuff
1	we purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the keys . the dvd gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel . the mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out . this was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for .
0	my bike did not come with an instruction manual . this seems to be a recurring problem with this company
0	i 'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official nfl football from a previous year and i wanted to get another one for backup . i know 'the duke ' is supposed to be the official nfl ball from this year , but there seems to be something wrong with the balls amazon is shipping . the first ball i got from amazon was hard as a rock , slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces . i got a second one and the stitching was a bit better , but it was still hard and slippery . and when it was exposed to rain , the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring . i have no clue if that 's to be expected or not since it 's all leather but it seems odd . in any case , you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves , which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball . so , it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe i play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands ( which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls ) . maybe the footballs just need to be broken in , but i 'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them , which no one seems to want to do . i 've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly , but it does n't really help . anyway , i find it really hard to believe this is the ball the nfl played with this year . something about them just seems cheaply made . in any case , i suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball .
1	this works just like the ad says . it is easy to use , is comfortable , and does concentrate your workout on the midsection . i am very pleased .
0	the first time i did this video i was in pain for three days . each time i exercised to this video it got easier , but i do n't have fun . i have nowhere to put the `` fanny lifter '' steps that i did n't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table . if i could do it over i would n't buy this product , however , you will get an excellent workout . if you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video . ( there is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video .
1	it works as advertised . not a lot to say about a bike rack . i have hardly any wobble from mine , and i suspect those that do did n't assemble theirs correctly or are n't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough . my only complaint is the weight -- it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack , which i do n't quite understand . the vertical tube has the lowest load , with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube . but it 's not that big a deal . it just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly
0	although the pack looks ok at first glance , a seam at the top ripped the first time i used it ... .i 'm returning it
1	led headlights are getting better all the time . this little guy is a one watt luxeon led with very good power regulation . regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken . the princeton tec eos has three brightness settings and a flash mode . i actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits . i 'd also prefer if the light used aa instead of aaa cells . so i guess there are two things i do n't like about this light . but the positives far outweigh the negatives . the light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter . ( i do n't ride under water so i have n't tested that feature ! ) it 's easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change . the light pattern seems to be just right for my riding . i use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount . i run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that 's fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets . the middle setting is better for general riding , spotting road signs and potholes and things like that . at the highest setting , you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker . i 'm pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by willie hunt , a real guru in bike lighting circles . and yes , i 'm enough of a nerd that i actually keep track of things like that . anyhow , the princeton tec eos is my latest favorite bike toy
1	i received my fitness bands shortly after placing my order . at first , i was confused , because i was expecting a box and instead it was a mailer envelope , but i could n't be more pleased with the product . for just a couple of bucks , i am able to find different ways to challenge the muscle groups in my upper body . also , i can take it absolutely anywhere ; one could fit in my pocket . here is the breakdown of the different colors and resistance which i 've taken from the merchant 's website . color resistance red x-light 3.3 lbs . orange light 4.5 lbs . yellow lt./med . 6 lbs . green medium 8 lbs . blue med./hvy . 10 lbs . indigo heavy 15 lbs . violet x-hvy . 20 lbs . if you can sympathize with any of the following scenarios , this product is something i would recommend for you ( well , i 'd recommend it for anyone , but these are the clients who have been searching for an answer ) : 1 . you live in a tiny apartment and/or do n't have a lot of a lot of storage space . you need something that you can tuck behind your dvds when it 's not being used . 2 . you do n't have the means to pay for weights or weight-training equipment . 3 . you ca n't afford to go to the gym , or are intimidated about going because everyone there is always so friggin ' buff . do not purchase if you are allergic to latex . it is only 90 % free of soluable allergens , so if you are allergic , do n't buy it . this information is specifically listed in the product description so ignore the poor review by the illiterate complainer . other than that , enjoy the product and happy toning
1	i bought these [ clear color version ] as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer . according to the gift recipient , `` they 're excellent , '' they really do n't leak or fog up . he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes . ( but please note : he does n't swim for more than one half-hour at a time , so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity . ) he also said that the fit is very good , and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types . for the price , these are an excellent bargain
1	no , this gun is n't very powerful - but that 's the point . this gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns . slow enough you can actually see the bb , accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet
1	i have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day . unlike every other backpack i 've tried , the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag . the only feature i miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest , so they do n't pull apart at the shoulders . however , the bag is heavy-duty and roomy , and i 'm easily able to fit my laptop , con law book ( maybe the largest book ever made ) , crim law book ( 2nd largest ever ) , and pocket dictionary . overall , if you can get as good a price as i paid for it , i would recommend it to any student or other user..
0	i bought this for my 10 year old son 's birthday . he was very excited about it and having derek jeter endorse it was an added treat for him . we spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it . we eventually concluded that it was a big disappointment . the ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole . i was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball . i can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like jeter , but imagine a 10 year old ! save your money , time , and child 's feelings
0	this compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers . the pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break . the card ( actual compass part that spins ) wobbles a lot so it 's difficult to get an exact bearing . it is like the oil in the compass is very thin . also , the direction line lid spins easily , making it possible to take a bad reading . ironically , this is the silva weakness as well . if you need an inexpensive engineer style compass , consider the silva . for a two more dollars , you get an aluminum case , a hinge that wo n't break and a card that does n't wobble with the slightest hand movement
1	the scooter ride is really smooth ! fast transportation and really fun down hills . the breaking is pretty nice and i like the wheelie bar too . you guys will love it - get it ! people say scooters are only for little kids , but i 'm 18 and i 'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc . everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs
1	pretty decent utilitarian paddle . i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there , since shipping cost was zero
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit . what it does n't say is that you really get a workout . no matter what incline it is in , it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil . if you want a strenuous workout , then this unit is for you . if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface , then this is not the unit for you
1	hey , i decided to review some things i did n't buy off amazon , but i have owned for sometime that are really great items : the kind i would buy again for sure if they were lost . i would say lost or broken , but jansport has lifetime warranties ! if anything happens to your backpack , all you have to do is mail it to jansport with a note of the problem , they will fix it for free and send it back to you . they will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon . overall , these are such great products , you just have to get a jansport if you 're thinking of a backpack . also , i am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful , which i hope it really is , i would love to have your yes vote ! with care , sa
0	the bottom bolt broke a week after purchase , which prevents the unit from functioning as designed ; it can not swing out of the way
1	i was hoping for more of an around the wrist type lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use . i needed it for the use of carrying around usb flash memory , but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller clasps . i would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref 's out there that need them for the whistles
0	all this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres . i ca n't think of anything else i have ever bought that was as completely useless as this . it is a toy , pretending to be an air pump . the nonfunctional lever on the top ( mentioned by other reviewers ) indicates that it was designed as a toy . i 'm just happy i was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway , not out on a trail . in the past , i have bought a number of bell products , including motorcycle helmets . i now shudder to think what might have happened if i had put one of them to the test
0	i bought this bike ( in the mermaid ariel theme ) for my 2 year old daughter . the manufactor 's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up . this bike is awful . the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike but , the pedals are attached to the front wheel like a tricyle- which make it impossible for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat . my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but , he even has a hard time riding it . its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt , i would take it back ! it was a huge disappointment-as a christmas gift . whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind . there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals
0	i bought these skates last year , with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them . when i tried to take the wheels off , they would n't budge ! spend the extra $ 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years . when the *indoor* wheels on these die , the skates die too . these most definitely are not roller derby skates , since those girls change their wheels all the time !
1	i purchased one and was so pleased that i bought another . keeps liquids hot for hours , much better than the thermos i had . wash by hand - do not put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness ( voice of experience )
1	i have been completely satisfied with jansport backpacks . they are very well made and i love the guarantee . the straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased . my 14 year old son has had one for three years , and it is still in great condition . previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most . this model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you 'd want to put in a backpack . great product
0	the bag is nice and everything , but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into . also , my feet got cold because of the zippered area . not really sure i understand why it 's there . my feet never get warm , usually cold . i liek the material and the look . also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg . night
1	i purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it does n't reset . i like the fact that i can open the lid and read the led without taking it off . my only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip . the plastic clip has lost it 's `` springiness '' and i 'm sure will stop working soon ; but at least i have the metal clip to fall back on
0	prior to purchasing this item , i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe . i wish i heeded this advice because , on top of fasciitis , i developed severe toe pain by using this product . i then had to by a second product anyway that , thankfully , eliminated the toe pain . even though this is less expensive than other night splints , it may do more harm than good . go with a firm , non-toe injurying splint instead
1	for the price this low-end home gym is generally able to do the things i wanted a cheap home gym to do . however , there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it . the biggest issue is ergonometric - this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5'10 '' or 5'11 '' . i 'm 6'1 '' and this creates problems for me . i have to find work-arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me . the problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises ( when you do n't pay attention to form , you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury ) and finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise . there are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit . it would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate . the two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars ( the bars that hold the weights ) . this first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower ( cable ) unit . it was n't level . this means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on . the second issue is also with the plate bars . the unit is designed to accommodate standard plates ( small holes in the middle ) or olympic plates ( big holes in the middle ) . a `` sleeve '' is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use olympic plates ( big holes ) . however the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard olympic size so an olympic size spring collar ( to hold the weights on the bar ) is too big and does n't work . i went down to home depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place . kind of a pain but functional ( just another work-around ) . if you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates ( small hole ) rather than olympic plates ( big hole ) . so i put this at 4 stars because for this price you really ca n't expect too much and it generally delivers what i expected a cheap home gym unit to do - with the one caveat : persons over 5'10 '' should try to find a home gym designed for taller people . since only 5 % of the us population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people . if you 're tall , good luck on that search
1	this monster is great ... my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already , and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit . we heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor ... luckily she had n't gone to her attorney 's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all ... thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $ 15 + $ 5 shipping we paid for you
1	i recently recieved this watch as a christmas gift . i am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather . i can check my altitude , see if a storm is brewing , and time each lap of my mile jog . everthing works great and is very accurate . after a glance through the instruction manuel i was able to use and set all the functions with ease . i love the feel of the band ; it is a perfect fit for my wrist . i would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price . this watch is truly fun to use and show off . it is the perfect watch
1	i usually do not endorse a product as `` a must have '' due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community ... however , this item is the only exception to my rule . i got this speed loaded to compliment my mp5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with carpel-tunnel syndrome can testify to , it 's a real pain to load that much one at a time . to satisfy this problem , enter the speed loader . pretty simple design and execution ; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds , place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly . that easy . easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds . it 's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks ... which it should n't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover . sounds ridiculous but i 've seen it done by the air force guys i play with . but let 's face it ; if you only have so many magazines/drums you 're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you . i strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch ; i carry mine in my bdu pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although i try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort . i strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it 's made of plastic , not metal . lastly a warning ; do n't go too overboard with the primer . sometimes if you 're not watching it you 'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you 've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up ... unless you 're at a friends house , let them clean it up . ;
0	i think they are too stiff for comfort . i do like the short finger , but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff . i thought it would stretch out and soften a bit . but it has n't . protects the hands well through off road trails though .
1	this yakima roof rack system works great and i highly recommend it . i bought one for my mazda 3 and have use it , along with a yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips ( i live a florida , skiing is far away ) . the rack has n't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install . yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
0	i received the exercise bike , put it together as soon as i got it , and started using it . just looking at it i had second thoughts about buying it . ten minutes later it broke . some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside . i contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me . one more thing . even if it had n't broken , the resistance setting on this thing is horrible . you get absolutely no resistance on it . that means no workout
1	the are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts . unfortunatly , the wear out pretty easily a the seams . i saw them cheaper at hibbets after i ordered them from here . oh well , only like a three dollar difference . i 'll know next time when i get another pair in about two months
0	the 'blue ' body ball that was sent to me was not blue . it 's white with some blue print . the pump did n't work right so i used a rocket type pump that came with a ball i had purchased from another company . plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable . the quality of the 'blue ' ball is good . when i opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm . my first thought was wrong color , wrong size . no inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart . ball is ok , pump is not . i was not happy but did n't want the return hassle . if you are n't fussy about color and have a back-up pump , go for it .
1	the wife and me each got a set and tried it out today . we were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice . the fins are great cut right thru the water . the snorkle is also great , kept water totaly out in waves and when diving . the mask was good/ok . you ca n't go wrong with this package . wish i would have got the other us divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more . we are happy . dan melissa
1	this is the perfect companion to take on your next trip . no more excuses . the gym is now portable . with enough resistance to give you a decent workout . this gym rat highly recommend these bands .
1	these are really great bearings . much faster than the conventional abec-7 's i was using .
0	my son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily . even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs can not get it to work . our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems , but it is not for the beginner
0	it is not worth the money . it broke the first day i got it and with the silencer and all that crap it does n't shoot . the bbs fall out the front . it jammed like 6 times before it broke . this gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all . it sucks a lot . do n't buy any products from hotimport toys , they are cheap , worthless , and extremely breakable
0	i bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use , and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose . pros : easy on and off , even putting them on by yourself . wrist straps are simple and hold well . breathe surprisingly well for the design . cons : even with hand wraps on , i found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well ; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so . the left i have no problem with for some reason , maybe just have a bad pair ? the padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like i was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches . grips make my hands feel too open when punching , ca n't grip a tight fist ... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them
1	i received this from my husband as a birthday present . it figures he was going to get something with the name 'ironman ' . =p i 've only used it for a week , but i think we 're going to have a long and happy relationship . ( tho ' i 've found my husband using it more then i am ! ) its easy to fold up , which is important as i 'm not the strongest woman in the world . but i leave it out as i know that if it 's folded and put away i probably wo n't use it . however , this sucker looks so cool that i really have no desire to put it in the closet . everything on it is convinent , with one exception . they made the display easy to see , but it blocks the tv ! lol . one star off for that ... =
1	probably the best cold weather gloves i 've purchased . they are warm without being too bulky . i have not yet been in low enough temps where i needed to use the battery feature
0	there was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts . my son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road . he could not . it is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface
0	this product is actually quite small . even though is says mini , i still expected it to be a little bit bigger . also , it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it . the seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat ( a shortened m-4 ) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . take a pass on airsplat . the sight seems ok for the price .
0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame . two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit . the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top . when we put that top on we found the same thing . that is when we found the frame was 4 '' longer than the top . there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner . after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together . when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product
1	i 've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent , so a new tent led me to check this out to see if i can stay organized . the closet comes in its own thin carrying case . it looks complicated at first opening , but it 's easy to insert the fiberglass rods , zip down the corners , adjust the velcro seams , and boom ! you 've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks , shorts , t-shirts , towels , and medication . there 's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated , and it rolls up out of the way . pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans , wallet , and the like are very handy , and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily . there 's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps . but the value is in keeping things organized , off the tent floor , where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent . i 'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture
0	i recently purchased a bean round zafu and i find it didnt live up to the claims in the least . this zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised ( wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with ) . first thing i thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was ; this thing seems nothing like the pictures . it 's saggy and about half the height of all the images i 've seen of it . not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift ( i weigh about 160 pounds so i dont think that weight is the problem ) . i 'm very dissapointed in this product . the reason i bought this was not only for the reasonable price but i thought bean seemed like a quality company . i payed $ 40 for this wich does seem reasonable . it does `` seem '' reasonable . that is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at . i bought this product from the comfort store . their probably the only internet company ; along with bean of course , i will never buy from again . unless i learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls
1	this is something that i have wanted for a very long time . when i first starting seeing the bowflex on those terrible tv infomercials , i thought , `` wow , what a piece of garbage . '' later on , while serving in the us air force over seas , my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one . along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training , a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus . it quickly became obvious that this was , in fact , not a piece of garbage . just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth , we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the middle east . when we returned , the bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it . it has been a few years now , and i have since left the service . i sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying , to include too much drinking and too much eating . i recently re-started some of my training , but i could only describe my progress as slow . then i came back to the bowflex , found a good price for it on amazon , and went for it . it takes a while to set up , so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of lego 's , i would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it . if you do , as i did , i would suggest that you start out slow , as i did not . i went with one of my old routines , which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days ( and after only one workout ) . the machine comes with a variety of assembly , workout , diet , and overall health aids . keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely . now for the only part that matters . here it is : it works . now here 's the disclaimer : it only works if you work . just like any other machine , weight set , pair of running shoes , etc . this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout . if you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have , say , clothes drying on them , then this is not for you . do n't spend the money on this if you ca n't stick to a routine . just buy a nice tv and sound system . if you can stick to a routine , this is perfect . if you want it to work a bit better , add a little cross training , such as running or swimming
0	it wasnt very good and it didnt tell how bad it wqa
0	i never got to use the product . upon opening , i realized the sizing details on amazon 's website was different than the one on the box . i am 5'5 '' and the 65cm was too big for me although amazon states it 's just my size
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived , it was very scuffed up and scratched . it also had a flat spot on it . i returned it for a replacement , which i got , and it was in the same condition . also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before . i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it . we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb . medicine ball and the same outcome . definitly not happy with it
0	horrible . the trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing . this is the second product form stamina that came in damaged . i would not recomend to anyone .
0	i ordered the item saying it was in-stock . but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up . i was told the item was in a back order . i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it . it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift . though i can say the item was nice when i got it
0	i bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks . i tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part . no recommendations for proper location . then i found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor . so now i have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact . going to send it bac
0	i tried this last year , and by the second day i woke up in great pain . i tried it again a few weeks later hoping it was n't the juice that caused the pain the first time , and the same thing happened . i give it 2 stars because i actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff
1	i 've purchased 3 tubes of this brand . the product works as advertised . i have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while i 'm walking around at work . this product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months . there are other brands on the market , but this is far the best value i have found . thank you sportslick , keep making your product and if it 's not selling , find different distribution channels
1	my doctor told me that riding a stationary bike or swimming are excersize that i can do with my arthritic knees . he 's right ! i love this bike . it 's comfortable and the computer provides different programs to use or make your own . it 's everything i wanted it to be . i was especially pleased with the service i got from amazon . the bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here . the computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing . i notified amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back . the second bike was not packaged any better , but it was not damaged as was the first one . i love the quality of the bike and the service that amazon gives . thanks amazo
1	this product is wonderful ! it sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music . we received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2.5 years old and still loves it . we keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear .
1	this mat is a good bargain and perfect for the casual pilates partaker like myself . rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away . good thickness and provides just enough cushioning so you ca n't feel the floor beneathe you . easy to wipe down and keep clean
0	just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked . the pack itself though is very nice , many pocekts for keys , cell phone , ipod , ect
0	i got this zafu ( meditation cushion . ) it is round in shape and too high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on , around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter . it is also pretty heavy , around 4 pounds due to the sheer size . i could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it . i would recommend trying it somewhere before buying . the filling seemed of good quality
1	backpack just what i expected , and i got it really quickly . thanks
0	i emailed skycaddie `` contact us '' the day after i bought a sg4 to ask for help . i have received no response in 3 weeks . i played today with it for the first time . a guy i was playing with today also had a sg4 . neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong gps signal . all we got was `` 999 '' or complete blanks . he has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and did n't work twice . it looks great on tv . it is a real pity that my unit did n't work today . i plan on returning it this week
0	i purchased the ab lounge 2 online , but returned it the same day . it 's too bulky heavy . i wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news , but it 's too heavy to move around , and it does not fold . i put it together in my living room , and then tried to get it into my bedroom but it would n't fit through the door . i had to un-screw the bars , fold pull it through the door . if i had put the ab lounge 2 downstairs , then i would never use it . unless you want the `` ab lounge 2 '' to be a `` permanent '' fixture in your bedroom or living room , then i would order something else . i need this thing to be where i can easily use it then put it away ... ... .the ab lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that . unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture , then do n't buy it . i 'm buying the `` ultra '' ab lounge because it folds for easy storage ... .it 's more expensive , but to me it 's worth the convenience of having the `` easy '' storage capability . i do n't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it 's not in use .
0	initially a very good buy , however after only 3 days of very light use i had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk ... . and i was in another room . for the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat . seemed to fill the room with it 's funk . does not grip well . i bought it for grip . yes , it 's stable . worth it ? not to me . try the hugger mugger earth elements mat ( 5mm model ) . it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat . not as stable in place , but seems a better value ( reasonable price ) . and it 's biodegradable
0	wow i thought thule was the company for this type of stuff . boy was i mad after a trip from nj to sc . the bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy ( top be expected ) . but when i got to sc and opened the bag ... .the horror ! the inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything ! there were also 2 holes along the to seam ! what a mess ... and i could n't use the bag on the way home ... .had to ship my stuff home ! i just wrote thule ... .we 'll see if they come thru for the customer sept. 12 , 2005 thule sent me a replacement , an escape 2 . great customer service ... .but does this mean the escape is better ? is the quest inferior ? there was no coorespondence with the repalcement ... i 'll try it out this summer
1	i bought this for my husband last year , and it 's still in good condition . we love it . the whole family can fit under it . it keeps the wind out really well , due to the double layers . it never ever turns inside out
1	i had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one i can say without hesitation that the product really works . its great for martial artists , particularly those whose arts rely on grabs , chokes , and need strength in the hands . these are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength , i hav n't used one in ages but my friends still say i have some of the strongest hands they 've seen and i attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher
0	unfortunately , this product did not live up to our expectations . it did not last one full season . the bottom braces not reinforced very well .
0	this is the first review that i have done on amazon . so far i have purchased over a dozen items on amazon and by and large i have been content/happy with all of them except this product . this product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled . do not buy this product . shell out about five bucks more for all metal push-up bars
1	i have been using michelin tires for the last 3 years , and i wo n't use another brand . hands down the best road tires you can buy ! worth the money
0	i bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy , severly lacking speed . i also bought the stiga champion which is lighter and faster . i would spend $ 6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it
1	i purchased these skates for my grand-daughter and she just loves these skates . i thought that with her being only 4 years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went . she tries to wear these skates everywhere
1	i was/am a runner who constantly was sustaining leg injuries of one type or another . i finally yielded to the fact that i needed to seriously cross train and reduce my running . i decided to row , however i abhore having to spend tons of cash on exercise equipment to work out indoors when running is virtually free outside . i originally wanted to spend only a few hundred dollar so at least i could get my work outs in and see if i really liked rowing . after reading every review i could find , i decided that it may be in my best interest to spend more than a few hundred dollars . when i chose the body craft vr100 rower i figured that i would still be compromising quality since it was a mid-priced unit . i did n't want to listen to things click and clack , and have to tighten things that would loosen over time . much to my amazement , this rower rocks ! it was really easy to put together , the parts are high quality , and the important thing is when you row you do n't even think about the fact that you are on a machine . it 's solid , steady , smooth , and a great workout . i use it 4-5 days a week for 45 mintues each time and have had it for about 1 month . it feels just as good as the day i bought it . if you are thinking about purchasing a rower , i highly recommend this one .
1	arrived promptly . is exactly what i hoped for . was unable to find this size and wt ball in any retail outlet .
0	did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not bu
1	great mat . provides good purchase , even when getting sweaty . it is a bit short , if you are above 6ft . ( like me ) to do ashtanga , but is great for hatha yoga
1	after polishing alloy wheels i treated them with boeshield . it leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish , however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation . very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels
1	received as promised , easy to assemble and works well though the fly wheel is making noise and will most likely require servicing
1	this product generatesa lot of attention . i like this one very much and looks very cool and very handy . it is very small when compared with other products in the market for a similar kind . the bright red led is kinda ok. ball point pen is very handy , though the quality of the tip is not very good
1	my middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which , up until this year worked fine . i went on-line to find the roomiest one i could , and still get style , color choices and outside pockets . we were amazed at how much room this had inside . now all her books fit nicely , and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch , pens pencils , her cell phone and other 'extras '
1	good quality , well made hat with offical mlb sticker under brim . well worth 4.99 .
1	my thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers . this is a great backpack with lots of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my l.l . bean . i recommend this bag
0	i was thrilled when i received this knife . it was cute , small , and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom-emergency situations . however , after less than a month in my purse , the floral plastic cover ( which in truth i thought felt pretty flimsy when i got it ) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other . sigh..
1	i bought this mat , because my gym recently began offering yoga classes , and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody . this mat is longer and thicker than the gym 's version , looks a lot nicer , and has a good 'tacky ' feel under my bare feet . and it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores . it 's easy to hand wash ( and comes with instructions ) , so i can keep it clean . overall , it 's a great yoga mat .
0	this fender is way to short on a 17 '' frame with 26 '' wheels . 80 % of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly . the rear part is abuot 5 '' + to short to stop most of the mud . i got it to stop bricks damaging my giant bike frame and failed ... . 2 stars for build of it and the 20 % of mud it actualy stops.. do not buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for..
1	i bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and i could work out together . it 's a little heavier than i 'd recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you 're done !
0	i bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that i needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck . the `` neck support '' that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way , but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck . ouch ! i would strongly recommend against this purchase . not only does it not work properly , but the foam pads were stained upon arrival . gross ! i will try another model
1	waterproof cases are so expensive ! ( and heavy ) we are n't divers , but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics , skiing , hiking , fishing , at the beach , etc . in addition to water , dirty hands , sand , and dust are hazards . this aquapac performs as described , kept the camera ( canon a95 ) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc . the picture quality was unaffected , but flash does n't work well due to internal reflections . well worth the price
1	the kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast . this is not a bike for the average 'fred ' . the kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight . there is an element of stability on climbis descents too , as the bike is a flat-out roadster . i 'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid kermis in hommage to this great road machine
0	during the time i was considering buying this model , i happen to see the same thing at a local department store ; so i bought it . i could n't wait to take it back . i was n't impressed with the cheap plastic . the pump came with the adapter pre set for a schrader valve ; my tires are presta . the blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the `` round end '' , remove and reverse the plastic adapter , re insert and then screw on the cap [ tight as per the label ] . seemed simple enough , so , i took off the cap , took out the plastic insert [ i noticed it is in 2 parts ] , reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap . when i put the end on the presta valve and then pressed down on the `` thumb part '' , i could n't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve , but was loose . so i decided to change back to the schrader type [ and use my adapter valve ] ; maybe this would be a tighter fit . so , i took off the cap , and tried to remove the insert , but only one part of it came out ; the parts separated ; i could not remove the `` bottom '' half . i was not going to force it out . i put the parts back together , re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it . no thanks ! ! ! i gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up ; it does n't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase
1	this is a fine product , and very adequate to meet our requirements . we received it promptly in good condition
1	great alternative to sugar . the fda clearly does n't care if we become diabetic , so we have to care for ourselves . this is a good part of god 's creation being used for its designed purpose . plus , the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised . great experience . i will buy again
1	they are made so well , operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package . the other review about them just does n't hold water . you can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem . the keyring has to be on one end or the other , but it is really not a hindrance
1	i was very pleased with the quality of this product . it was perfect for the 11 year old it was purchased for , not too short -- just right . sincerely , terri j. sullivan
0	i purchased this product from performance bike to replace a much older ( 10yr ) cateye wired computer . i have a certain amount of brand loyalty to cateye because their products are typically of higher quality ( almost always manufactured in japan as opposed to china ) and typically last a long time , like the aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer . i purchased this product without much hesitation , but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set . the cateye vectra is missing two critical functions : ride timing , and average speed : features even my 10-year-old velo2 computer has . it offers only current speed , max , odometer , clock , and trip distance . the overall quality of the unit is good , and i 'm sure it will last for years with the solid japanese construction , but i 'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes . luckily , the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with cateye 's other wireless computers , i.e . it works with my older cateye cordless 2 computer also . bottom line : pick another cateye model and watch the feature set carefully
0	i own two , and have had problems with both . even when pre-heated , coffee/ tea is luke warm 3 hours later . sturdy product -- should be for it is pretty heav
0	first off ... the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng . second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily..dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel ! !
1	these skates were a bithday gift for my child . the really fit well and will roll well even on our dirt drive .
0	the motion sensor would n't turn it on . it does not maintain calibration . cold weather numbs it . i 'm tossing it out
0	terrible assemble . i coudl n't even assembel front wheel . the axle is way short , and no axle nut . so there 's no way to place wheel in fork drop outs
1	this is the second suunto vector watch i have owned . only because the first one was lost . the only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years . seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better . the battery lasts about 6 months only.for the price of this watch ( $ 230 ) you think tehy could do alittle better . other than that i love the watc
0	hydrolized gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend . do a search on that and you 'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones . mmmmm . does n't that sound good ? what 's more - this gelatin protein is incomplete , so it does n't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles . it may taste ok , but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them . or just eat jello if you really want gelatin . avoid ones with collagen too . same issue
1	i paid less for this item then i would at a store , and it came to me ! i did n't have to carry a heavy item out to my vehicle , hassle with getting it into the trunk , and drag it into the house . it was right there on my door step waiting for me . i love amazon
1	perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have
0	never received product . ordered 6 of the flashlights on dec. 3 for christmas presents . e-mailed seller several times to find out where order was , they never answered my e-mails . good way to do business !
1	this flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense . this is meant to be an emergency flashlight and if you use it as such , it is great . this is definately not a spotlight type of light and it is n't meant to be . but when you need some light in an emergency , a little shaking and you have some light . it 's starting to dim ? just shake it some more and voila , more light . you could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help . i do n't know why people are giving this bad reviews . this is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working . and if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say , the light will last longer then people on here are saying . if my 6 year old niece can figure it out , i would think that adults could too . but , there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything . this is an emergency , no battery shake flashlight . i think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself . you should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles , campers , boats , kids rooms , etc . how many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you could n't find new ones ? this one has worked everytime i have uesd it . but then again , i do have common sense . this flashlight is great !
1	you owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the cree xr-e led . it 's roughly twice as bright as the currently comparable luxeon led . also , the `` regulator '' circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery ( not all led flashlights have this feature ) . it 's small enough to be put on a keychain , yet puts out a powerful beam
1	too long for 5 '' tall person . i had to modify it for my wife . its the same identical chair as ab lounger , ablonge cair etc ... same manufacturere . it has a sticker on it that says `` watch fingers while folding your ab longe 2 '' on it . same company , same chair . easy to modify 'drill or saw ' either way to fit short people . great product wife loves it . other family members buying them now . 4 stars not 5 due to me needing to midifying it . buy this one save money instead of ablounge .
1	this puppy got to me so fast it made all my other orders seem like they got caught up in christmas rush ! ! s $ $ was well worth the speed of delivery ! !
1	i am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product , since amazon/toys r us do n't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer . i bought this in-store at toys r us because sizing information was not available online ( except for the size of the box , for some bizarre reason ) and i did n't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size . so let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5 '' to 22 '' . i think overall that this is a great set , but i marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection . from my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard , i can say that i would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands , so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me . but with a young child who knows ? ! this is for my neice ( i am not a parent ) and whilst i am generally happy with the set as it is , i think it would be nice to include the elbow protection ( which is afterall available in other sets , but does not appear to be available separately ) to make a complete safety package . perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads , or perhaps i am a touch too cynical
0	okay , i have owned the mio for 9 months now and i agree with all of the above complaints , it is not accurate , it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time , it 's big and clunky looking , etc , etc . my biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game . the heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless . i returned it to mio ( with my $ 10.00 check ) and 2 months later , i still have not got my watch back . i complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory . they assured me that finally after i threw a fit , it would be shipped last week . still no watch . the watch not only sucks , but the company sucks as well . save your money and buy an ironman .
1	these cars can be summed up in two words fun and loud . i have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends . they work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well . i am even thinking of getting a third . they do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily . well worth it .
0	9 of 9 people found the following review helpful : everlife is littlelight , november 22 , 2005 reviewer : agnazzo ( tampa , florida united states ) - see all my reviews living in florida i bought two of these everlife flashlights . the party that said that these flashlights are charged up during shipping is suffering from shaking of the head . it takes at least a minute of shaking after delivery before the flashlight is giving out its maximum amount of light which is very low . after that to keep it operating more shaking is in order . the illumination which is very low compared to other battery flashights dies out very rapidly and need additional shaking to keep it going . this flashlihgt to be fair may come in handy during a hurricane power failure . led flashlights that use batteries are far superior to these shaking flashlights.the batteries last a very long time due to the low power that leds operate at
0	if you decide to purchase this bicycle , may i offer some advice . if your bicycle arrives missing a part , please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased . my wife 's bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt . the folks at the customer service department at pacific cycle were understanding and said that i would receive the missing parts with 10 business days . after two weeks passed , i called again , this time the parts were on backorder . curious , i asked why i was n't told that two weeks earlier . `` you have to dig down in our system '' , was the answer . i asked when i might receive the missing parts . `` could be two or three more months '' , she replied . when i suggested that two months was a long time , she said something i did n't expect , `` you know , there 's no reason that you ca n't ride the bicycle without the fender ''
1	this gun shoots fast , hard , and accurate . plus all the extras you get with it are just awesome
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived , it was very scuffed up and scratched . it also had a flat spot on it . i returned it for a replacement , which i got , and it was in the same condition . also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before . i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it . we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb . medicine ball and the same outcome . definitly not happy with it
1	i bought this net to accompany a kettler basket i recently bought for my bicycle - and it fits perfectly - it was as if they were made for eachother ... i can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack ... 6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical..
0	i received my valeo ocelot training `` glove '' , still waiting for the other . bubble pack had only one glove in it . amazon help has no concept of partial shipment
0	i bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars ! now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007 . too bad i bought it in december . this is a piece of junk . i thought i was ordering a mid-priced pedometer . ( it was $ 12 at that time ) . i agree about it not staying on , and even though i followed the calibration instructions , the steps were never accurate . i had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the lcd most of the time . so is a backwards three actually an eight , was that a one or a seven , is that 5000 or 6000 ? i never knew . the only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000 . i 'll probably try a 'cheapy ' from walmart . it will probably do better than this .
1	the ultrastar is a classic disc , wonderful to throw and catch . i personally feel that ultrastars vary based on the color , but i just may be imagining things . these fly better than the average whammo , although i feel that i can throw 180g innova pulsars a little bit further . still , the ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern . i 've thrown the adidas 175g as well , and while that is not as bad as a beat-up whammo , it 's still not quite the same
1	i recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it . the rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners . also , there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips . the sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you do n't have it fully zipped up . my only gripe and the reason it does n't get five stars is that i think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately
1	i purchased the valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball . this ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it . this ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball . plus it is the same size of an official size men 's basketball . color is also very nice
1	many years ago , an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel . one morning , while he was in the back office behind the front desk , two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door . he could see them , but they could not see him through the privacy security glass . the men continued to beat on the door , trying to get in . he waited inside patiently , with his glock pistol . as soon as the door fell and the men ran inside , he shot them both . they turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money . i recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions . it turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help . when asked why he had to kill them , he simply said , `` i own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety . i did it because it was my right and i could . '' fortunately , it was considered self-defense . i remembered that he always carried a short stick , attached to his keys . it was not until many years later that i finally figured out what that little wooden stick was . i became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself . this was my first kubaton . i was concerned because this one has a pointed end . the pointed end , although not sharp compared to a blade weapon , will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part . i was afraid that if ever i had to use it , the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that i was acting in self-defense . i bought another kubaton , from the same manufacturer , with a flat end . the replacement baton is exactly like this one , except the end is flat . i tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas . but it takes a lot more force to do so . more importantly , to the average person , it looks less aggressive than this one . if i had to use it in self-defense , a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon . if you are not concerned about perception , then get this pointed baton . if it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth ( the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags , outerwear , and hiking shoes ) , it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes . but please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife . that might make it difficult to claim self-defense , in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself . my old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable . he not only knew how to use his weapons , but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault . he knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself . this pointed baton , made out of hardened aluminum alloy , is probably for such a person . my friend 's tip : here 's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine . the keys themselves are a part of the weapon . and you can make them more effective , which will increase the damage from the baton . take some keys that you no longer use . any metal key would do , but try to find different sizes . about four of them would do . take the keys to a grinder ( even a rasp will do ) and sharpen the teeth of each key . now , put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys . face the sharp keys in opposite directions . meaning two should face one way , but the other two should face in the opposite direction . the idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail , the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker 's flesh . the keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging . citan 's experiment : please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand . i tried this technique . i wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post . the sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand . without the gloves , my hand would have gotten badly cut . for what it 's worth , i swung against a large watermelon and the keys did n't bounce back though . i do n't have anything else to add here , except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker 's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding . i 'm not an expert though . but it was fun trying it on a watermelon
0	this might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike ... but i laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped . not very durable
1	this is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up , swing plane , grip and tempo . however i still need video and pga pro to correct my swing . here is the fault that i found : i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing . this is not a cure for all but it helps . the other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast
0	do not order from this company , as amount will be charged to your account ( as mine was ) , and i never got the item ... ... .i emailed the company and never heard a word ... amazon is crediting my account after i made a complaint . unsatisfactory company ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
1	looks great , functions great . manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small . i have 20/20 vision and i ca n't always read everything that is being displayed . it is mostly in the alt and barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown . highly recomended
0	i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game . this has nothing to do with the real dance dance revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name , which is not on the actual product . very disappointed !
1	i love this ab wheel , but some of the reviews here are ridiculous , like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month . that 's 72,000 calories , or 2400 calories a day . to put that in perspective , you 'd have to run 24 miles a day , every day , to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise . let 's say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out . heck , give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes . that means it might burn off 50 calories a day . if you did that every day ( unlikely , because your abs would want some rest ) , you could burn off just under half a pound in a month . and that 's based on some pretty optimistic assumptions . so it 's not a weight loss device . but it is a great ab strengthener , better than anything else i 've use . it 'll tighten up your stomach like crazy , and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off , you 'll end up with a great , flat , ripped up stomach .
1	i bought the large and x-large sizes . i would say the large size is standard for most travel , but the x-large is best for packing clothes , because they quickly fill up space . the large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch
0	no risistence at all ! ! u might must swing your arms n legs in air..
1	i love the look of this mat . love the pattern and colors , but it is a bit thin . i just layer it on top of my old mat
0	i put this mount on my m-44 today , and i am not impressed . there is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount , and where the original sight seats . not a whole lot , but you do n't need much play to have your zero [ ... ] out after a couple of rounds . all of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes . one of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it . the screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on , so i mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight . the mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted , and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true , and i do n't know if the scope would be able to compensate ! i do n't think loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place , once a few rounds have gone down range . some of the supplied allen wrenches did n't even fit the set screws ! i have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted , and i am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss . the design could work , if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process . on the plus side , it was cheap , and the shipping was quick .
1	this is a minimalist kit which is n't really suited for everyone , it is also overpriced for the items in it . what it is good for is to get you thinking what you need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact . overall it 's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing
1	i was hoping for more of an around the wrist type lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use . i needed it for the use of carrying around usb flash memory , but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller clasps . i would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref 's out there that need them for the whistles
1	i 'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout i can get by using these high-resistance water gloves . the unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off . wish they had a `` medium '' choice of size . they only make a s and a l. these gloves were a great find and the price was right
1	overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet , takes up a small amount of space , and easy to use . my only complaint would be the lcd - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer , but amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem . now every thing is great
0	i am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently , i did n't want to invest a lot in one . i bought this because i thought it looked cool and was a great price . it fell off constantly ! for a few days i would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying , not to mention painful when the pin stuck me ! it is fairly accurate , but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor ? i finally invested in an omron that not only stays on , but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground . i also bought it on amazon , but it was around $ 18.99 . it stores a week 's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress . i am in love with my new pedometer , i wish i would have invested in this one first
1	here 's a secret for the uninformed : this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish . this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get , and if you 're a regular ebay seller , it 's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges . with this scale and a plastic bag , you can weigh any package , no matter how irregularly shaped , and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two . but remember- it 's a secret
0	i got this for my boy scout 's birthday . he really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than i thought it was . i 'm not sure if it is usable . my son has n't tried using this yet
1	i got a pair of these boots for christmas and even though i 'm not sure what all they can be used for , they are great ! the construction is top-notch , they 're easy to use , comfortable , etc . i seen cheaper boots on the market , but when i 'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete/tile floor in my house , i want the best product for the job . ;
0	plastic junk . tried it once . wont try again . just get a piece of rope and cut it to size . this thing is suppose to be adjustable . only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle . the plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks , leading you to trip over it . just get a piece of rope
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff . i use it every week to take drinks to sport events . it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes
0	have received and reviewed this item . i cranked it for 2 minutes . the radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died . i tried to crank it longer - same results . it is useless . it 's large and bulky ( though very sleek and nice ) . the cranking handle looks fragile and i suspect with all the cranking this toy needs , it will break sooner than later . bottom line : do n't buy it . i own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank
0	do n't ever buy this . it is a rip off and a gimmick . your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness . even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever . other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one
1	this really is a great tent . three people can sleep in it , but i 've found it best for 2 people because then there 's still room for all of your stuff ( or a dog . lol ) . i 've used it for 3 years , and it never disappoints . i 've been in one good thunderstorm in it , and it did great and did n't leak at all . it 's very easy to set up , ( especially when you arrive at your site after dark ) . it vents really well , but best if you face the vented side into the wind . just do n't forget to open out the little cross vent ( with the `` ! '' ) on the other side . the inside pockets are really handy , and i think you can get a `` net '' that you can hang from above for more storage
0	this item sounded great in the ad , but the only thing right in the ad is that it 's pocket-sized . no one can understand what i say through it . when the volume is turned up , the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent . i thought this would be a great device , but no one can understand me 10 feet away , much less 200 . if you order this device , save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund . warning : the shipping is non-refundable
0	i recieved this gun about a week ago and could n't wait for it to arrive . it managed to arrive one day early because i live close to it 's store in california . when i recieved it i could n't figure out why i could not mount the scope . it was broken . next i tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written . i started to shoot it and every time i wanted to use the larger clip i had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting , which was quite often . next i had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and did n't even feel it when the bb 's hit in a t-shirt . plus , aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic . lastly , in it 's first cqb the strap fell completely off . here are the main good 's and bad 's of this gun . good : -relatively cheap -lays down a lot of bb 's in a short amount of time . -collapsable stock is nice . -relativly accuracte at close range bad : -clips either tiny or worthless because it wo n't stay in the gun . -extremely weak -accesories may come broken . -insructions awful . -low battery life . -fire settings jam/do n't work p.s i 'm not really jacqueline k. schmidt
1	i purchased a coleman exponent f1 ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the cascades in oregon . i have owned a liquid fuel stove for years ( msr whisperlite purchased in approx 1992 ) , and have loved it , but as i am getting older , i have been wanting to trim my pack weight down . i have found the following advantages to the f1 ultralight . # 1 . easy to use . simply unscrew the burner head , open the pan supports , screw the burner head back down , screw stove onto canister , light match , twist valve , and you are cooking with gas . # 2 . no priming . the liquid fuel stoves required priming , and pumping , which made them harder to use than i would have expected . with this stove , you simply turn the valve and light . no waiting for the generator to heat up . # 3 . very light weight . the stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone . this thing is a feather on the back . the disadvantages are there as well . # 1 . canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister , and at temps close to , or below the boiling point , which is close to 0 fahrenheit , the stove simply will not work . for me , where and when i camp , this is not an issue . # 2 . fuel can not be used as an emergency fire starter . # 3 . fuel is expensive compared to white gas , or unleaded gasoline . the owners manual claims this stove only works with coleman brand canisters , but i have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 butane / propane blend works . i have used brunton , coleman , msr , and some odd black canister i bought at a gas station in oregon with it , all with excellent results.. compared with other canister stoves such as the msr pocket rocket , brunton optimus crux , snow peak giga power stove , or primus yellowstone techno trail , the coleman exponent f1 ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me , sported the lowest weight ( .4oz lower than its nearest competitor ) , and from what i was able to determine in impromptu in store testing , appeared to have the best pot stability of the group , with pot supports that spread out nice and wide . one tidbit about this however is ... the evernew 1.3l titanium cookpot , is oddly shaped on the bottom , and sits and a slightly odd angle on the f1 . i have tried many other pots and this is the only one i have a problem with . the issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the evernew pot , and not with the coleman stove ... summary . if you camp where the temps are n't freezing , low weight , ease of use are important , and cost of fuel is unimportant , then this is the stove for you . however you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood . if however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you , or you are going to go mountain climbing , or whatever , you will want to bypass any canister stove at all , and just go with a gasoline model instead . the coleman f1 ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves i had considered , had the best design , and came in at a price point that i liked . for the majority of backpackers out there , i would say this would be the best stove for you .
1	this product is quit usefull to walk overnigth and to do works at dark sites
0	i dont have this item , but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is $ 100 and they are selling it for $ 2.50 ! ! !
1	in these days and times backpacks , bookbags , etc have become so outlandish . this is a classically styled all american backpack . no bells , no whistles , just a good ole standbye bag ! hard to find now-a-days .
0	yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps , but it does n't keep your hair dry at all
1	never thought i 'd own a hyd pack , but now i do n't know what i 'd do without one . this company offers free lifetime tip replacement . previous reviews are accurate -- no initial taste or odor . take proper care for long periods of storage ( rinse with lemon juice or baking soda ) and you 'll enjoy a long life out of this . zippered pocket is nice , too
0	i used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed : 1 ) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2 ) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling ( luckly , i noticed it floating near me when i stoped to clear my mask ) . referring to this product as 'waterproof ' is criminal as everything i placed in the holder was saturated with water ; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water . in addition , this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day .
0	this is not what i expected it to be at all ! it did not come with a pole and it did not improve my skills . if at all it made my wrist hurt more .
1	this is the best racquet i ever have . i 'd been using wilson for a long time ( 5 racquets ) this one is the lightest and the most powerful . i have improved a lot . and no more pain in my elbow ( tennis elbow ) thank you for such a great product
0	for several days i wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt-affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch . on every occasion , the watch did not count all the steps
0	the very day i received the armor abs 2 , i used it , and all the bands came loose that same day . i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab
1	it was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering i 'm a 110lb girl . it only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes . it is slightly rickitty however i can go as fast as i want to and it wo n't brake or anything . it really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite t.v . shows . also , i am very tall and i had plenty of space , and it 's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side . if you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that wo n't brake on you , marcy is a good choice
1	although my wife disagreed - i bought this for my son 's 6 year old birthday . it took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so . materials look reasonably good , it 's light enough that he can cary it , and stout enough that i ( dad ) can also enjoy a fun ride . i must say this is one of the coolest toys invented . easily 5 stars
0	these goggles suck . i swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them , but they fog up in 5 minutes , fit terribly , are hard to adjust , and cause irritation around my eyes . they leak water and the different nose pieces are just a joke . they go from tiny , a little bigger than tiny , huge , and then extra huge . they do n't fit ! what a waste of $ 15 . i 've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store . they are only $ 5 , and they fog up and leak the same as these .
0	i was very excited to order this bike . as i started to put it together i noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing ! i still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes were n't even close to being inline with the display ! the largest drawback and thing that upset me was that i did n't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is does not allow for adjustment from seat to pedals . i 'm 6'3 '' tall , and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable
1	these are great cards , they can be bent and even get wet and the are still good as new . they are easily cleaned with a damp cloth . perfect for the avid card player
0	the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want . the clips breaks off easily . the pedometer just stops working . mine stopped working after 1 month , i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks . do n't bother buying cause it wo n't last long enough to be worth it
0	i would not reccommend this product . i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again . it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing . the unit is ok but not as good as it looks . hope this was helpfu
0	i saw this ad on tv today and about to purchased from here at amazon instead of zone pilates ' web site . i kept reading reviews and one reviewer ( evelyn from fl ) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body . actually , i was thinking the same . i was about to purchase and saw s/h fees ( about $ 15 ) . also her `` keep on looking '' and i did . i found out `` everlast for her pilates fitness ring with dvd '' here at amazon for only $ 14.99 ( asin : b00091ryzy ) and `` bally fitness ring for pilates with dvd '' $ 17.99 ( asin : b000h3ynr6 ) . both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for free super saver shipping on orders over $ 25 . sorry , my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers , like me . ps . i have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it does n't stay put on the body , especially near the hip . it is good for toning my legs though . i really want the butts from the models of zone 's commercial . maybe i can try with everlast ring with half price . update 1/11/07 : i received my everlast ring yesterday . the physical ring is very identical to this zone ring but actual workouts are quite different . i really like zone 's workouts from commercial ( you can also watch again from their website ) , especially for buns thights . i wish i can purchase just dvd from zone with low s/h : ) update 1/16/07 : i 'd also purchased this zone pilates from walmart ( ~ $ 25+7 s/h ) and received it yesterday . it was a huge mistake ! the ring is very identical to everlast , not any better ( rather slightly heavier ) . the accompanied dvd has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min . and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one . they were not as effective as everlast 's workout dvd , which is more precise and has better menu . the instructor from this zone pilates , kim stoneman , has flabby belly and sloping buttocks ! it seems like she is not using her own ring unless it 's not effective as advertised and she proved that ! very un-motivating for me ! she stands in front of a still camera so we can not see particular movements from different angle ( unlike everlast , you can see those ) . zone pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you can not see her in the workout dvd . do n't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this zone . i 'll return mine to walmart asap
1	i got this trainer assembled in an hour with no problems . it 's a great deal for the price- not flimsy at all . perfect for at home needs
0	these stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands . i would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks
1	it was a gift for my niece she loves it , she 's only 7
0	if this were an office shredder , mon/fri support would be ok but , hey , i have a day job and so i 'd like bowflex to be responsive at my convenience . not so
1	this spring is of industrial strength . it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs . better than any made available at your local hardware store . it 's only about 4 in . long so it does not take up much space . however , if your ceiling/beams are not structurally sound , no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag
1	this product does what it claims it will do . put in the time and effort - you 'll feel great ! of course , i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box . however , i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started . only doing it a few weeks , but enjoying it
0	this was a horrible product , it was difficult to manuever and control . it did nothing but immediately cause my arms , shoulders and wrists to hurt . i felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area , my stomach . not even a little . it was boring and pointless to bother.this machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and i do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles . its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also . it hurt my spine to bend in the way they said . i felt the machine digging into my spine . i was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms i could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time . dont waste your time buying this product . its expensive and not worth it .
1	excellent product . great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed . the height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly . very good quality materials for the price . i have had my eye on one in the in-flight magazine when i travel but i saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping
0	the shipping for this product cost more than the product itself . it was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope .
1	i got this a few years back , and it is a very important member of our household still ! my wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck ... the possibilities are atrocious . with the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided . there is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon . well made , well designed , and very well built . like our dyson vacuum , this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering . it may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it 's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance ! i am happy with my build , i do n't want to be bodybuilder , if you do this may not be the correct machine for you ... like it is for me at 43 ! that is my opinion , and like all the others ... i 'm sticking to it ! thank you for your tim
0	i also bought this because it was the consumer reports `` best buy , '' and i expected to get a lot of use out of it . the frame broke on my first ( i weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week ) after about 1100 miles , and its replacement just died after only 350 miles . so far i 've paid about a dollar a mile . i 'll never buy from schwinn again
1	first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns . the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful . the sight is really good and its adjusts . its also really accurate . the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk . but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu
1	does this gun use 6mm or .12 and if i do use .12s will it damage the firing mechanisim
0	this ab wheel is simple to use . however , i have n't had the same results as the other reviewers . the only place i have felt the workout is in my arms . for a good ab workout , i would recommend buying an ab dolly or the video 8 minute abs .
1	i purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong ! i use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect .
0	this mattress has deflated on my guests since the first time i used it . very aggravating because it 's a pain in the you-know-what to send something this large/heavy/bulky back
1	this speed loader worked great by reducing loading of a magazine from a few minits to a few seconds . great during an airsoft war
0	the first time i used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they 're made out of cracked in three different places . perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely , but i 'm not going to risk an injury finding out . in the trash they go ... i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
0	the design of this product ( that it is a backpack ) is perfect for my husband 's lunch at work , however , it is too small for the two or three medium-sized gatorade bottles and lunch contents
1	the indo board is an essential product for off-season and even on-season snowboarders , skateboarders , wakeboarders , etc . it allows you to practice your moves , and learn some new moves !
0	the gun did not work . when we emailed hot import toys , they gave a suggestion on how to fix it . that did n't work . we emailed them asking for a new one . no response . we emailed them again , asking for a paid return label since we paid over $ 20 in shipping and handling . they told us to take it to fed ex and tell fed ex it was defective and that fed ex would n't charge shipping . fed ex doesnt work like that ! ! we called this company numerous times , left numerous messages ... no return calls . we emailed amazon and complained . got a response from amazon and had to pay over $ 19 out of pocket to send it back to hot imports . amazon says they will credit our account . i strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere . no invoice was enclosed with the product . my sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either..
1	after reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions , i took that into considerations and purchased it anyways . nobody was really talkin bad about the board . most of us have the urgency of putting it together w/out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings . you have to approach this one differently . i went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because i defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together . the instructions although not as detailed did mention that you must read the entire instructions carefully to assemble this item , failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re-assemble again . finally , it took us 4 1/2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience , it was n't that bad at all . i only wish they added spare washers/nuts just in case you lose it . once its installed , i added water to it and let me tell you . its supposed to be portable but w/ the base filled , its pretty heavy . the board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym . 50 '' is adequate for a home use , but you better have the apace for this . the base takes alot of room . the ability to move the height up/down is as advertised . i can do it with one hand . very nice ! ! ! i measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to . one thing i found out just now . this `` slam-it '' rim , you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty . i know because lifetime answered my question i emailed out . they do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it . i defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one .
1	this bench is a must have for outdoor sports . this is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out . it is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench . the bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go . the frame is made well . there were only two issues that i had with the bench . the first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material . second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields . the top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag . therefore the rate of 4 stars
1	most `` replica '' type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall , not these . made out a single piece of stainless steel , these are very solid knives . as the previous reviewers stated , these do come very dull , but a file , a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that . once sharpened these knives are very useable
1	my physician told me to exercise or else , so i looked at comsumer reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike . amazon 's price was great and i have been delighted . if you like to read and exercise , this one 's for you
1	good product . easy to use . good price . like having the neoprene cover over the metal ... makes it softer to hold
1	we bought this for our 8 year old son for christmas . he absolutely loves it ! it goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride . brakes work very well . riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius . given the chopper style , long nose ... quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall . i suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety . easy to put together ... a no brainer . well worth the cost . he told us he loves feeling the wind in his face , shirt sleeves flapping ... i think we have started something i may not want to deal with as he gets older . future harley riders look out !
1	i 'm no professional bike mechanic , but this stand has been great for my little at home workshop . if you 're looking for a more precise truing stand spend a little more money . it does the job if you 're like me and just want you wheels true enough , not necessarily perfectly true
1	i guess i did not read the description ... an adapter is required to properly use this . i will either buy the special adapter or adapt it to my bike rack
0	its rickety . the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up . it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck . in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion . not worth half the money it goes for
1	compass worked wonderfully for my trip around new england this summer . only reason i do n't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving . remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window . i forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later . never came off again the whole trip after i moistened them . worth the money .
0	i recently bought the gaiam 4mm eco conscious rubber yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat . after receiving this mat , i am extremely disappointed . i feel cheated . they claim that it is 4mm , but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps . the mat is very flimsy , stretchy and slippery . after 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart . gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat , but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat . i have used a natural rubber mat at my studio , but it is completly different that this mat . even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat , since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio . if i wanted a cheap mat , i would have just bought one of the low quality pvc mats . i should have spent the extra $ 5- $ 10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality . dont make the same mistake i made
0	you can not sit upright in this chair . bad for soccer games ( why we bought it ) . the chair is designed to lean back . the company is not amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth . unless you plan to sleep in this chair , it stinks
0	i tried this last year , and by the second day i woke up in great pain . i tried it again a few weeks later hoping it was n't the juice that caused the pain the first time , and the same thing happened . i give it 2 stars because i actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff
1	i 've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great . do n't bother useing the scope though it 's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway . this gun is great for mid range rapid fire do n't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter . the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy . the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it . do n't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it 's been drop , banged up and runs like new . so yea get it ! ! ! !
1	wow , it 's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment , but my schwinn 213 recumbent bike arrived today . i have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives . my bike arrived in a timely manner . the box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact . nothing inside was broken , scratched or bent . the instructions were crystal clear . it only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running . the hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled . the hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1 , etc . i have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together . it is a solidly built piece of equipment . i only tried it out for a few minutes , but it is quiet , pedals smoothly , and has a ton of features . ok , now for the things i do n't like , the list is small but worth noting . the fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan , nor can you read the display . only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease . i am 5'10 '' and the fan does not adjust to blow on me . i can just barely read the display from where i have to sit . a book holder would have been nice . that is it . the things i like far outweigh the things i do n't . it comes with 10 pre-programmed routines , manual mode , timed trials , etc . you can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes . i have n't used all the features , but so far i am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it , i would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise . 10-15-06 ok , i 've had this for a week now and i want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is . i solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow-bar and gently prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read-out screen is attached to . take the electronic screen off before doing this . the plate bent up just enough that now i can read the screen just fine . i still do n't get much benefit from the fan , but the fan does n't really blow hard enough anyway . i have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing . i ca n't begin to say enough about this bike . if you truly hate exercising , this is the bike for you . schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something i do n't mind doing . i am using this bike along with the weider crossbow , another piece of equipment i ca n't rave enough about , as my total body workout . i hope to be slimmer , trimmer and stronger 6-8 weeks from now . also , i want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating . when i used a treadmill , i had to either blast the television if i wanted to hear it , or use headphones , which were uncomfortable once i started sweating . this bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume . if you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile , this is the bike for you
0	just did a a/b comparison between the sx800r ( 16 mile range ) and the midland gxt-450 ( 10 or 12 mile range ) . neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised . the midland lost communcation after 1/2 of a mile apart in the woods . i then tried both radios on a flat open road . at 2.9 miles apart , neither radio could pick up it 's counterpart . it was n't until we hit the 1.8 mile mark that the motorola picked up some static from the other motorola . still nothing from the midland . at approx 1.5 miles apart , the motorola worked fine . i gave up with the midland . the reason i did not give the motorola a 1 star rating was because i like the weather band feature . bottom line is , that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about , forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range . a good rule of thumb is , if you can see the other person , then you are in range .
0	i ordered several of these tables as christmas presents , two of five arrived broken . both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs . the tops are made out of a brittle plastic , spend more money and order a table with a metal top
0	when i received the shipment , i was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes . when i placed the order , no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes . otherwise , i would have ordered kickboards in 'blue ' color . the yellow and purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife .
1	i do n't usually select items by `` name brand '' , so i tried many other boots before i tried the timberlands . but none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable . i have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof ( in rain and puddles , thus far ) and have shown very little wear
1	if you need to eliminate chafing from runing , jogging or just active walking , this is the stuff to use . rolls on like deodorant . one application will last for a whole day . highly recommend
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
0	both me and the mat slide all over the place . it has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis .
0	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know . besides , it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! ( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 . for example , i own a 3-9x44 scope . this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom . the second number refers to the size of the scope lens . i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one . also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail . if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight ( peephole )
0	this ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone . the ball has two small holes ( smaller than the size of a dimple ) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger ( 2 aa ) . the remote uses a 9v battery . the ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge . the ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge . the ball is not meant to be hit , but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance . because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball , the ball does not roll straight on its own . the ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam . when using the remote to control the ball , the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound , then it takes off still rattling away . an arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll . you can reverse the ball 's direction , but you ca n't make it go left or right . the two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are : 1 . you can only direct the ball in two directions ( front - back ) with the remote . 2 . a fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away . as a gag ball , it seems like it is of only limited use . but for about $ 10 , what more can i expect
0	our three year old twins received two of these cars for christmas . the joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on christmas day ! my husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that , the other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we are stuck with two broken cars and one that does work , but are wondering when that one will break too ! i need to mention that the kids were not particularly rough with the cars ; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior . the controls are cheap and will break eventually . the cars are very loud , but on the positive side , the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them . i would definitely not recommend this product
0	i ca n't believe they sell such a piece of c ... p ! after inserted the 9v battery , i just pushed the button to start shuffling one time , and i heard a cracking noise right away . one piece of the mechanism fell off , and i could hear it when shaking the box . of course , the shuffler was broken ... wished i could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c ... p in some store
1	this machine really makes you feel it . i like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great . the only thing i can say is i wish it folded up for better storage but other than that , i like it .
0	the wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor . my experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating . the holes are n't properly pre-drilled . the hole at the top did n't match up with the cap-plate hole , which a ) made it very difficult to screw together ( the first screw stripped ) and b ) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly . i experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom , and the bolts not going in all the way . i never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions . based on the wobbly central column , i decided to disassemble mine and send it back .
1	my daughter received this toy for christmas and at seven weeks old , immediately loved it . my five-month old nephew also received one and loves it as well . it is easy for infants to grab and soft so they do n't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth . the colors are visually engaging and it has a `` nice '' rattle sound to it ( loud enough to get the child 's attention , not too loud to be an annoying toy ) . i recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift .
1	my 12 year old daughter and i put together the trampoline in a few minutes . i use it for exercise , i watch tv or put on the ipod and run on it . of course , the kids like to use it to jump . it is lightweight and easy to move around . highly recommended
0	i bought 2. one fell off my belt and i lost it . the other does not work at all . it works even if if i shake it and the insides hit the cover from inside . maybe its broke already.i dont recommend anyone to buy it . just walk rather than buy such gizmos . that is the pilosophy i learnt from this episode
0	i ordered the igloo quick and cool 150 from target . i had it 2 days after ordering . it was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used . back it went . be careful ordering from target in january . they have to do something with those christmas returns . check out the product carefully .
0	i wanted to confirm that i had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers . the everlast bar comes with nuts that do n't fit the screws . the nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through . i returned it for a new one , thinking that surely this was a mistake , but the replacement had the same pieces . horrible ! however , i was determined to make my purchase work , so i put it together with force . once i had everything assembled , i found that the bar does not keep together by design ; even with the screws pretty secured , the outer loops on the bar ( they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles ) can unhinge and detach from the bar , because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws . that 's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air . thoroughly dissatisfied . i 've used the door gym and it 's much more secure than this
0	well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters.. they flop around so you can not get maximum impact from the machine . i am totaly disappointed with this machine
1	this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever . you can sharpen anyting with it ... but i use it mostly for knifes . any knife , serated , stainless , it works great on filet knives . it is quick and easy . i believe the brown stones are the key . they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen . one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel , but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair . best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened . i bought one of these 25 years ago . i still have it and it still works great . i had to buy one for the motor home . since i do n't sharpen the knives in there before we go . and once you have sharp knives you do n't go back . i love this sharpener . mostly because my wife uses it too . we always have sharp knives . thanks for a great product ! ! thanks ti
0	i went to swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others . this is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand , but i found that the suggested retail is $ 4 lower to what amazon is selling it for . just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price . even though amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap . probably too cheap to be any good
1	i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter .12g bb 's will damage the gun because on shorty 's [ ... ] it says only use .2 can you guys help me out
1	this bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action.the old style falls all the down to the ground an then slowly comes back to standing position.this one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse.my kid 's are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag supervised being taught proper punching/elbow/knee and kicking strikes ! i would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on , it would break real quick and with a h20 base , not good.great for young kids to learn on ... . ( not beat on ) the key is always , learn to strike good then worry about how hard ...
1	this is the first cathe strength workout i 've tried , and i found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling . however , keep in mind that this is an advanced workout , so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than cathe ( i generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what cathe was using ) in order to complete the workout . cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout , including a barbell , several sets of dumbbells , a full club step , and a toning band , but i was able to get by without the barbell , step , or band ( although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout ) . the main workout on muscle max is 68 minutes long , but the dvd also offers several premixes : upper body only ( 42 minutes ) , upper body push-pull ( 33 minutes ) , lower body only ( 23 minutes ) , and timesaver ( 56 minutes ) . the full workout breaks down as follows : warm-up , lower body , chest , back , lower body , shoulders , bicep , tricpes , core and stretch ( the dvd includes subchapters under each of the above categories ; see cathe 's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip ) . during the warm-up , you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches , but i liked that cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked . also , cathe constantly varies the count , which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement . another thing i liked about this workout was that cathe allows plenty of time between exercises , thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest and to change your weights as needed . i also enjoyed the upbeat music , some of it vocal . overall , this routine left me feeling completely worked out , yet not exhausted , which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor . i think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video -- highly recommended
0	this tablecloth bleeds . as soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms ! i ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect ! go figure ! avoid these
0	i guess you get what you pay for . this pedometer was difficult to calibrate , and continued to miscount steps , and therefore distance , covered . it is made of plastic , and came unclipped easily . i am a big person , and have started walking to improve my health . this product does not work for me , although it might be a different story for a slim person . it has been relegated to the junk drawer , and probably will eventually be thrown away . i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it
0	this weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion . you would have to be a little kid for it to work . after working along time to put it together i found neither me nor my 6'2 '' kid could use it effectively
1	first off this gun shoots a mile ! ! ! i hit my friend in the head . it left a welt the size of a 2 quarters ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if i was you i would bey this gun ! !
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find . i was told easy to use . my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning
1	this was bought for my boyfriend and i to sleep on when he comes to town . it is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us ! it loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything . it is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed . if you get a good wave going you can jump right up ! the other problem i had with it is that it makes me sweat . even with the covering and a sheet . i am still sleeping on vinyl and so i sweat . not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning . i am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because i am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man . it holds us with no problem . it was over all a very good purchase and i am happy with it
1	great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym . it 's heavy and very dense , very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym 's . heavy duty , takes dropped dumbbell punishment , and resists damage/cuts . use a drywall t-square as a guide , and put a new blade in a box cutter . take several passes to cut it and take your time . it cuts straight and square for a professional look . i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym
1	if you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always huge to more then make up for the difference . yes it is `` cheaply made and not designed to last '' , but so are all similar products , so it is at least par for the course in that regard . just trying to even out the review , i did n't think the other review was fair
1	this very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise , you can just concentrate on the muscle you 're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping . it 's terrific
0	i tried $ 50- $ 60 sets from regent ( who apparently also does spalding ) , franklin , and sportcraft , and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets ( alternately , one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance , including who pays shipping costs ) . regent and sportcraft had several handles with too few threads , inviting breakage . franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet 's threads stripped when tightening by hand , and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened . some sportcraft end caps rolled under , and they claimed their 2 ¾ '' balls were 3 '' ( if they were rounding , why do n't they round their 3 5/16 '' balls as well ? ) . franklin 's stakes had different tapers , and about 1/16 '' different diameters . on the personal preference front , sportscraft 's handles are grooved , franklin 's balls are , and their wickets are narrow . regent 's colors are dull . rated 1 star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment , and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 ¾ '' balls
1	i highly recommend the wenzel raised insta-flex air bed over any other air bed out there . i have had two other brands and wenzel is the best . having a bad back , sleeping on an air mattress is not something i look forward to , but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality , i have had no back problems and have slept great . the built-in air pump is a dream as well
1	my boy loves his drinking funtainer ! it has never spilled on his lunch box even though i have put it in different positions including upside down ! it it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will not spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot ! the straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and i have not had to replace it and the year is almost over ! ! very durable . i love it and i 'm planning to buy more ! it is well worth the money ... and i bought it for $ 15.00 ! !
1	fantastic product -- i am a group fitness instructor and i use this product everyday -- i add a banana , peanut or cashew butter , plain yogurt , ice and water -- this is in lieu of dinner -- i do n't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up
1	this wiffle bat is light and easy to use . substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse . it will not hurt the horse , but will get the horse 's attention
1	we purchased the mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks . the kids think its great . it takes a good half hour or more , but worth it . make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container , it can be hard to get off . really easy to clean
1	great deal , great price , free delivery . you ca n't beat that . i use it every day , and have lost 30 pounds
1	this is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding . if space is an issue , this is a great product . it is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks . i would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy . the wheels on the side make it very portable . my boys are 13 and 11 and they love it
0	i purchased this bike rack because i was moving out of state and did n't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike . i also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails , parks , etc . so , i went with schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive . i drove from nc to fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea with this rack . i did n't have any trouble assembling the rack , only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go . however , during my trip , i had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back . the buckles do not hold the straps in place . this is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway ( or any busy road ) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic . also , even if the buckles hold , the wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame . i had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back ( and yes , the rack was assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack is probably a great value if do n't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it is a a complete waste .
0	i was very disappointed with this purchase , since i have always been an under armour supporter . these gloves felt like i was wearing a material that sped up the onset of frost bite to my hands ! definitely not for cold weather , do n't waste your money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit . what it does n't say is that you really get a workout . no matter what incline it is in , it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil . if you want a strenuous workout , then this unit is for you . if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface , then this is not the unit for you
1	i am very pleased with this product . it is good quality , easy to use , and well worth the money
0	you get what you pay for . these are extremely poorly made . they were slapped together with mis-shaped finger holes and seams . cheap and fall apart at the slights movement
0	i was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much , i thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything . but when i tried it i discovered 2 things . first off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place ( which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one ) . and when i finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it 's on it only burns about a calorie a minute . this bike might be great for arm workouts because it does n't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance ( though i only tried it for a few minutes ) but definitely not for your legs
0	i bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the north dakota badlands . the average nightly temps were 40-50 f. the bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights . the bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight . on my second night of the hunt , i was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag . it did n't just come off , it literally broke . there was no way to fix this in the back country . i had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning . he spent big $ $ $ for his bag and of course , had zero problems with it . oh well , for the price and free shipping , this is n't too bad of a deal , just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you .
1	when i first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant , the other thing i do n't like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous . overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying
0	if it is kept in the hilt , it makes for a decent wall piece . if you pull it out of the hilt , it is not a good thing . my sword has a bent blade , and a bent handle , which was noticable while in the hilt . i would not spend the money on this item
0	i got four boxes of these matches so i was motivated to learn how to use them . i had read the directions about poking them into the lid . i tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes . it burned down to the wood portion and went out . incidentally , these matches are very short . perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter
0	i bought this over the yakima equivalent for the locking accessory . what a mistake i made . the racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work . i called thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to rma it . i sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case . but i would steer clear if i was you
0	this item is horrible ! it is flimsy and did n't even come with any instructions . even though it was so cheap i feel so ripped of
1	this was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter . he had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head . i would highly recommend this product
0	though i bought this boxing glove with a $ 20 discount , i still think it was overpriced . first , i had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and i only have medium-sized hands . i make do with taped hands but using this glove with the `` popular '' evergel hand wraps is out of the question . ( tape 's better than the evergels anyway . ) second , on one of the gloves , the everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off , though i 'd only just started hitting a heavy bag . it 's made of this cheap plastic-like material . ( you 'd think for $ 100 , you 'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality . ) i cutoff the hanging label entirely . third , the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact . with the 10 oz glove , it does n't feel like anything special , just a thin layer of foam . i 'm not impressed with the padding . overall , the glove is of medium to low quality . it even looks cheap . ( the leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary . ) i 'll use the glove as i 've already spent the money , but my next glove i think is going to be a title platinum . unfortunately , everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it 's reputation
0	... and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery . i have half the cable now . good price and attractive product for a low security environment
0	had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it . scratched from day one . i ca n't understand why a $ 150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i 've had $ 50 nike watches that were scratch proof . after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking , but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking
1	i got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new . i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great . it look very real , but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun . this gun is awesome ! ! ! ! !
0	i returned this item , as it did n't fit my 19-pound boston terrier well at all . it was way too large for his body . `` small '' obviously means small for a larger dog instead . just be aware !
1	excellent service and a quality product at the right price . i had no luck finding foose balls locally .
0	i bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later ... took it out of the box , it 's pretty simple to put together ( took about an hour ) . but after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it 's wheel ( like a bike chain off its gears ) . the bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore . and i ca n't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it . tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5 , going to have to call them from work on monday . do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this . it 'll save yourself a trip to the dump , too . this bike is a piece of junk
1	it is the best backpack i have ever seen
1	i have used this bench for a little over a week . for the price you ca n't go wrong . it is sturdy and seems to be well made . the adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place . ( great for lying leg lifts ) . all and all this is a good bench , i would have given it five stars , but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses , this is not true , it can almost go vertical , but not completely . still , i think you would be happy with it , i am .
1	i 've been carrying and using these swiss army spartans ( or similar model ) for about 35 years . bought my first in germany and could n't get along without it now . great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use . it 's small enough and light enough that it 's comfortable to carry . does n't have all the useless `` bell and whistles '' that you 'd probably only use if you were a 12 year-old boy scout . only problem ( mine , not the knife 's ) is that i tend to lose one about every 6-7 years ... so i bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away . another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly ( via a threaded handle ) into the corkscrew
1	do you even know what you are talking about ? i may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now . 350 fps is nothin . my ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410 . next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review
1	this dvd is tough ... but do n't be scared . cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout . i love the music on this dvd ... . it 's so much fun ... it makes me want to keep jumping ! ! ! the upper body routine is about 20 minutes long . it 's efficient and straight to the point . i 've never seen results as quickly before ... cathe will definitely delivery results ! ! !
1	the yoga studio where i take classes has a very hard floor and i have bunion problems . this mat is the solution . there is only one downside to this mat : standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat . however , since i take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week i like the challenge . the upside is you do n't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick . i did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so i would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just wo n't stay in place . i will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat
0	this is the biggest joke on the planet . no doubt , it is scary , but c'mon people . i guess it 's to scare the sh*t out of you . my comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item . think about it . . . the toilet . one of the best places for germs . and you want to attach some rubber device to it . i 'll do you one better , and you 'll get just as good a laugh from it . ( also , it 'll be a lot cheaper ) go buy a roll of saran-wrap . cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl . wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it . i do n't think no one will die from this type of trick
1	the jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient . it doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact . getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter . this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them . i had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said `` i never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal ``
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them . she was n't really used to skating either , but has done very well on them . not too many falls and learned easily . great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin
1	the taste is not bad . u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it . i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it . i went from 140 to 145 using n-large 2 , eating a lot , and working out .
0	i bought this pump and used it on three bikes , a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent , then broke . if you need a pump , i suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one . i tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson . bell products are cheaply made and do n't last beyond a few uses . do n't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a sunday when there 's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air . stay away from this , and other `` pedestrian '' pumps . makes you wonder what a bell helmet will look like after a spill
1	what are you waiting for ? quite reading my review and get this great scooter
1	works like a thermarest . easy to roll up and store . wish i did n't have to buy the carrying case separately
0	the hr monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use , no use any more . also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists , not at all comfortable on mine
0	indeed , these are way too short for protecting your knuckles . my boxing coach laughed when he saw them . ringside make really good , long wraps which are better . -- j
0	this tent is not designed for the rain , instead of running off it collects on the top . if left unattended , it pools up until the poles bend and the entire this collapes unrepairable
0	i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services . i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase . ( mine in three months . ) the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself . ( in one occasion , they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it 's good . ) these back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months , and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you , even though it 's still within one year . i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise , not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying : `` this is our policy .
1	yankees mlb cap , fits most people , its a slick slender apparel , with the mlb logo on the left side . a true authentic cap . it can be worn any given yankees home games . its a all natural navy blue cap with the white ny symbol in front . it has an adjustable velcro strap to fit it to your liking . also an already curved shaped brim for under 30 dollars with fast shipping and handling . only the true yankee fan will appreciate it 's look and major league design .
0	got the mat for free for ordering the series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped . it is made by this rubbery plastic , and it 's just okay . i would n't pay $ 100 for it , it 's true , but i was very disappointed that it ripped so easily . not very durable ... but i got mine for free , so i guess i was n't too surprised it was given away .
1	my grandson is very happy with this gift . it was well-represented and arrived in plenty of time for christmas . i would purchase from this retailer again
1	if you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block , i can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable . when you are pressing on the blocks , they are firm enough to withstand your body weight , but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure . blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you ca n't reach the floor in a pose . the lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm . there are many ways you can use these blocks and once i started to do the yoga step by step workouts/yoga practice sessions , i found i really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions . ~the rebecca review
0	i would n't recommend this shuffler to anyone . it shuffles more from one side than the other . when through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through . the cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down . the switch just works part time , you have to stop and restart several times
0	i 've had this product about a month , purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well . unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed . i had to reset the screws ( as other reviews for this product have mentioned ) - but one screw would not come out . it was stripped . a week later , same problem . i tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week . apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand bag to the base . this causes either : a ) screws to strip b ) the holes to enlarge and warp , meaning screws no longer catch . apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit . today finally the bag got ko'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws . i 'm a 6'1 220 lb . guy and i 'm only using about half of my full force into my punches ( again , i hit it just about every day ) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use . i 'll call everlast monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original
0	maybe i should read the description better , but i was disapointed to find out , when receiving it , that this is just a usb key with a pen and anemic led light . no `` swiss army stuff '' . not even a knife . i thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have , you know , a knife ? that said , the usb key is very tiny , almost too small on its own ( detached from the swiss army non-knife housing ) , so it 's good it has a `` home '' within the casing , otherwise it would probably go missing
1	i have n't used this camping , but i set it up in my living room as soon as i got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes . it looks great and i ca n't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five ! ! i know exactly where i am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen .
0	amazon has the brand mislabeled as apex , but it is ipex . cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked -- obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight . the rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart . the `` chrome '' paint is already peeling before even one use . also , buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments , and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time , the maximum weight on each is 15lbs ( if i would have thought about it , when i purchased it i would have realized both of these ) . overall very poor quality . i will try to return
0	these coleman machetes are essentially useless . they are so lightweight and flexible , i do n't know what they intended them to be used for . they will cut some weeds , but they wo n't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1/2 inch . i have used a few of these , as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where i live . they also rust badly . you 're much better off with an ontario knife machete , or another better machete .
0	received this suit yesterday and used today for first time . you do sweat but as one of the other reveiwers mentioned i took off the pants and they tore horizontally thru the crotch seam.. one wearing and kaput . written to valeo will see what they repl
0	i ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday . the first shipment arrived on schedule , but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented . delivery was refused and another bike was sent . the 2nd bike arrived , with the box being in less than perfect condition , but delivery was accepted . when my son started assembling the bike , he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike . the bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally . we still have not received a credit for the return of the bike . i am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again
1	we were having trouble deciding between this rower and the kettler coach . this one was available thru amazon , but the kettler had to be purchased thru merchantila , which has a horrible reputation . so , we went with this model . i could n't be more pleased . where it was manufactured was not listed , so i contacted lifecore . i had a response within 24 hrs . made in taiwan , but do n't let that put you off . this is not a china quality product . it 's very sturdy . smooth and silent . the preset programs vary not only in intensity , but time . some are 10 minutes . some half an hour . have n't tried them all . four programs are for you to set . ordered it on a monday . here by friday . my husband had it set up before i got home from work . he did complain that the instructions were n't well written . but he never complained about actually putting it together . must not have been too difficult . all tools were included . you can also set your workout by time , distance , calories and strokes . while checking merchantila 's bbb rating , i also checked lifecore 's . they have no complaints . that also helped us decide . i love this machine . i 'm sorry i did n't get a rower sooner
1	this is a must have for anyone interested in boxing or boxing fitness . everlast is the most trusted brand in boxing history . established in 1910 they are a quality company that specializes in boxing equipment . take it from an owner of an everlast heavy bag they are great and very durable and can withstand lots of punishment . great for any teen , young male or old tymer tryin to get his groove back
0	this product falls into the category of `` not worth the cost of shipping '' for me . the bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat . the bag was shipped in an envelope via usps first class mail for $ 1.35 . samfe was the retailer that amazon used for this transaction , so free super saver shipping was not available . samfe charged $ 7.50 for shipping . i generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits , hence the low-star rating for an otherwise adequate product
0	the idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic . you have a regular burner , and a small grill at the same time . the execution , however , leaves a lot to be desired . fit and finish in this product are extremely poor . out of the box , paint was flaking , and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit . the igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part . the grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when i received the unit . reading other reviews i ca n't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number : the bad kind and the good kind . if so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety .
1	ca n't beat this cabinet for the price . pine wood makes it very light , but sturdy . looks nice on the wall
1	good knife to throw in your survival kit . compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made
1	i 've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years . all i wanted was a thin , small and light knife and i got it . the blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while , soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example . i have had the vary tip break a couple times but it 's because i was doing something foolish with it ( like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ; ) ) . it 's not the best , it 's not the worst but can compete with ether , witch is the best in my opinion . shortly after i bought it the speed safe spring broke , eehhh who cares it opens fine without . it 's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface . it 's vary thin profile is comfortable and i sometimes ca n't tell if i have it with me or not . it has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones ( means no binding up , even when in need of oil ) . the frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time . my favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down . i chose henge down so it 's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket . if you want nice quality and availability for the price , kershaw is worth looking at
0	just to warn you , this product does not come with a usb cable and it does n't work with most laptops i have had . you need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all . the ecaddy is great , but the caddylink is next to worthless
0	this was one of our worst purchases . rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better ! the snorkle and mask were constant problems , leaking , filling with water , etc . we had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up .
0	i was also disappointed that the product came without a dvd , though the initial description said so . but amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price . appreciate their gesture . agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with . it took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile . yeah , not very happy with this product . p.s : contrastingly , had a bad experience with dell on a similar situation when i bought a nikon camera . dell blamed the wrong description on nikon and expectedly , nikon blamed dell . neither owned up the error . but amazon was pretty good . i really appreciate it
0	the quality of the construction was poor . i would not recomend this to anyone .
1	my pain management dr. said this was the best bike to pick with the least amount of pain i could choose
1	very useful stopwatch . i like the mutiple functions . my use is for swim workouts . this watch allows me to have three intervals going at once . the print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture . not a real problem . i am glad i bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes .
1	if it were possible , i would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world . you need this loader ! ! ! most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick ... that is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at . this will speed up your loading time dramatically . buy ! ! ! !
1	i got this gear bag and love it . it does n't have a lot of the features you 'll see in higher-priced bags ; its really just a durable mesh duffle bag , but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry , and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins , boots , masks , snorkels , and any other small gear like defog , gloves , knives , wrist compasses/computers , etc
1	i was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations . it 's more than quiet , it 's silent . very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs . the bike is sturdy and easy to put together . it 's compact and does n't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable . i could n't be more happy with this purchase . for those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised , my box had a dent or two , but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts
0	the first time i used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they 're made out of cracked in three different places . perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely , but i 'm not going to risk an injury finding out . in the trash they go ... i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
0	i got this item to give a a gift . i got it fast , however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken . it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 % refund and have to pay shipping , which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded . do n't bother with this one
0	i will not recommend this product . i use it in my car and most of the time is wrong . if you really need a compass you better read all reviews . i usually do it but i could n't find about this product and well ... lucky it was only a few dollars .
1	this product is excellent ! very sturdy , durable and the videos are challenging but doable - from beginner to advanced you will get the results you 're after . i highly recommend this product
1	we originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house , and had nowhere to put him ( he was 3 weeks old ) . as time went on , it just became convient to put him on the mat , close to us . it was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys ! he started by just swinging his arms , and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys ! he loves the star in the middle . he could spend all day talking to that thing alone ! he loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go . i highly suggest this gym for any baby ! it is something that us or the baby could n't live without
1	i had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap . now no problem ! it keeps my hair fairly dry , or at least drier than with other caps i 've tried . it 's easy to put on and take off -- no hair pulling . it 's lasted well so far . much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap .
1	i have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily . although i have not had this one long , it has shown no type of wear , and i use it every day ! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout
0	i just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together , expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when i unrolled it chinks of the mat came off . very poor quality and i 'm unsaitsfied . i would not recommend getting this mat .
0	i ordered this gun because it was such a great deal . when it arrived , i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked ( a big crack ) , nothing a little gorrila glue ca n't fix though . also the accuracy is n't consistent , it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet . i had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate , otherwise it was 3 feet high . the pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too . so this gun was a good deal but is n't the best quality gun i 've had . you have to load it from the top of the gun , which means taking off the laser , putting in the bbs , and putting on the laser again . the magazine does n't even come off ! it still has decent speed , and is n't crap ( it 's just bad ) . it was worth 15 bucks though
1	skim boards keep the kids busy for hours , this a great way to get the kids away from the tv . this board is nice especially with free shipping..
1	i bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever . you can jump super high on it , and the people that work for flybar are awesome . i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke , and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free .
1	this is a very good lock in this price range . the rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night . the only downside is the key . you must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning , otherwise you might bent the key
1	its foam ! 7 bucks for shipping ! nice product but will shop around for another seller next time for sure
1	i used to have a similar product , this one works the same except for one little handy detail : it does n't stand on itself like the old one i had
1	love the trike -- it is so cute . my 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it . the instructions to put it together were not very good , but it 's a trike , so it was n't that hard to figure out . i would recommend this trike to any `` cars '' fan !
1	it looks like a cartoon snail , and it makes a racket when you squeeze it . i 'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be
1	this is a great snorkel . seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by . the purge valve on bottom works well
0	
1	this bike seat is a huge pain to install on a bike . it took my husband and i working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it would n't work ... we persevered and got it on . it is fabulous to ride with our son . it is very sturdy . our son is very large and rides in it just fine . the helmet slides on his head , but most helmets are tricky to get just right . overall we have been very happy with this purchase
0	i ordered two of these with high hopes , to be utterly disappointed . first the design of the battery holders is bad . they are supposed to hold two c cell batteries . when i tried to get one in , i initially concluded that a different size must be requried , as it seemed the c size would n't fit . after much futzing around , i managed to get two c cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs . this one now works but i doubt that i could successfully remove and replace the batteries again . the battery holder is too flimsy . on the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder . after 15 minutes of trying to put it back i gave up . this unit is totally unusable . nothing on the pyramid package label indicates that two batteries , c cell size , are needed but not included . second this is a fender mount light , meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there 's no way to do that with the hardware included . while the pyramid box does say `` fender mount , '' that description was not included in the online product description . and , this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy . the lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light , and i doubt that many bike fenders these days would . why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount ? ? i 'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product , and with the vendor who sold it to me
0	i just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together , expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when i unrolled it chinks of the mat came off . very poor quality and i 'm unsaitsfied . i would not recommend getting this mat .
0	it may be a good piece of equipment , but it 's too big . it 's big because you can lean on it and do leg lifts , etc . but all i wanted to do were crunches . it was hard to put together only because the screws would not fit into the slots , i almost broke my fingers . i gave it away and bought a smaller roller that works better for me
1	i struggled with the decision to buy this trike , thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth . however , i ended up getting one for my 3 year old , and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough . whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius , and me and my back thank them . i no longer live in fear of `` daddy push me , '' since pushing does n't require bending over to that terrible `` pushing a tricycle '' stance . the trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver . it has a low center of gravity and does n't feel quite as tipsy as some . i recommend it
0	this bike should not have the name mountain in it , you can not take this bike off ride . it might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails . do not buy this bike
1	get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash . there like $ 70 - $ 80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up . yeah its that bad . but this gun shoots good
0	i thought this would be an actual toilet monster , and was happy to see such a low price . it is , however , made out of rubber , and can not actually eat people
1	my 9 month old loves this toy . before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls , he would roll it on the floor and crawl after it . it keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it . also , there are no loose parts or pieces to lose , which i appreciate . great toy
0	anything coming out of a box at christmastime is exciting to our toddler . most toys , though , hold an excitement for him . this trike lost his interest after one try . scuttle the trike i say , or let it become unmoved furniture in your home
0	i tried $ 50- $ 60 sets from regent ( who apparently also does spalding ) , franklin , and sportcraft , and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets ( alternately , one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance , including who pays shipping costs ) . regent and sportcraft had several handles with too few threads , inviting breakage . franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet 's threads stripped when tightening by hand , and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened . some sportcraft end caps rolled under , and they claimed their 2 ¾ '' balls were 3 '' ( if they were rounding , why do n't they round their 3 5/16 '' balls as well ? ) . franklin 's stakes had different tapers , and about 1/16 '' different diameters . on the personal preference front , sportscraft 's handles are grooved , franklin 's balls are , and their wickets are narrow . regent 's colors are dull
1	i looked in consumer reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and deceided to buy this model . i absolutly love it ! it was very well priced through amazon.com and i thought the shipping was very fast . ( about two weeks which is not much considering the weight ) . it is very heavy and well constructed . it does need to be put together , but i did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty . everything is so well laid out for you , and the instructions were great ! the treadmill is comparable to fitness center models ! very easy to operate . the folding is easy and it comes down very gently . i am very pleased with the bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and i thank amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot !
0	i bought this watch because i wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size . it is huge - looked like i had a clock on my wrist . take into consideration
1	if you 're looking here you 're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore you need to own this . jim hardy has figured it out . forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is : - take the club to inside and up on the backswing , - keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open , - and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you ( some might say `` stuck '' ) , while simultaneously `` coming over the top '' to get the club out in front of your body , - and swing well to your left to complete the through swing ( i.e . never `` down the line . '' ) yes , this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you 've ever heard . but then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities ? in most cases if one is being honest the answer is `` no . '' so it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it 's time to give hardy 's `` plane truth '' a try . in addition to the video series which is amazing , i would also recommend both of hardy 's books as essential material . you want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills , you 're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you
0	title says it all . dont purchase this to use with the thule t2 .
0	do n't be fooled by the positive posts , i am convinced they are bogus . this is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices .
0	well it was shown as a full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece ... as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the full tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it . fast shipping though
0	i wanted to use this pump to pump my bike , but it never worked . it leaked . it can only used to pump up balls only . it is a piece of junk
0	this is a nice heavy item , perfect for covering your trike . but i have yet to figure out how to put it in place . i'vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture . my son ( yes , he is a grown man ) put it on better than i had on my tries . but the front wheel is still out . they need to put some arrows on it or something ! ! ! barbara lynch williamsburg , va
1	it is a good one . strong and to some extent heavy . i improved a lot
1	for the price , not a bad piece of home gym equipment . cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good .
0	i bought it given reviews by others , but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it has n't worked ever since . i 'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works
0	i gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf . this pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it . it has problems that need modification . the top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body , making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb . that means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely . remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it . add some adhesive velchro to the back of the case . make a fabric band for your ankle . attach the ends to each other with velchro . put a strip of velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band . i get accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline . the hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring . the strut is made of thin brass . aluminum from a soda can would work , too . i made a `` v '' in one end of the strut to hold the spring . i pushed lightly against the spring from the left side , drilled a hole in the brass , and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board . the strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it . i now have quite a few miles on the pedometer . ( i have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely . ) several times the pedometer reset itself to `` 0 '' for no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed on the reset button . one incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security . once it reset while i was walking . twice it reset while i was napping on the sofa . i am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit , but i do not know . static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses a counter circuit . if someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter , connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts . connect a button switch to the two wires . freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
0	not worth the shipping cost . completely flawed . i ordered the oregon scientific , which is perfect . should be zero stars . dr. parha
0	just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked . the pack itself though is very nice , many pocekts for keys , cell phone , ipod , ect
0	first off . the knife is great . i would n't expect anything less from swiss army . only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 % . and since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it , i give the knife a two . only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well .
1	our family are backpacking campers . we make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible . i bought one my-ti titanium flatware set for my husband . we all loved it so much that i ordered more for me and our son . they are light weight , come with a link to keep them all connected , and we prefer them to the `` sporks '' . when we are n't camping , they are in our lunch packs and/or picnic supplies . amazon.com had them at the best price
0	i would like to tell you my opinion of the bike , but i never even got to see it . the company that amazon uses to ship the bike ( eagle freight ) lost my bike ( even with a tracking number ! ) they refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold . even the supervisor never returned my phone call . i explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately , but unfortunately they would only send it by eagle , so i took the refund . if you want to pay a small amount for a bike , buy it here . if you want to actually own a bike and ride it , buy it somewhere else
1	baby einstein has done it again ! they have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love . the best part of it is ( they call it ) the activity star . it 's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at . the activity star has different settings for playing music : on , short play and motion activated . it 's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star-tip that flash along with the music . my 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights . compared to other play mats in the same price range , this one is the best ( in my opinion ) .
1	just like the ones used in college intra-murals , excellent stitching and look to be very durable . fast shipping , and great deal
1	this is the best knife sharpening system i have ever owned . the kit has 2 medium sharpening rods , 2 fine sharpening rods , a booklet , a vcr instruction tape , the plastic storage case which doubles as the base . i can easily keep my spyderco delica knife razor sharp ; also my wusthof kitchen knives . ( even the serrated knives ! ) this kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives
0	well , first of all , i never folded it up , because it was very difficult to fold , so i would just roll it into a closet . i would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise . i had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and i had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard . i weigh 110 lbs ! i really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person .
1	very sturdy and reasonably priced . my daughter is just learning to skate and loves that she has her own skates that are `` just like the one 's at the skating rink '' . i would recommend these to everyone
1	great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even ! wrap easily and securely - nice and snug - real leather - soft but good padding and supports inside . great wrist and fist supports upon impact ! i 'd buy them again.. need more color choices now.. :
1	i am very satisfied by this short sword and by its cutting abilities . the sheath however is very soft and prevents the sword from quickly putting in it
1	my kids got these from grandpa . they love them ! they 're fun to bowl with in a dark room . we 've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light . the problems : the clip is pretty hard to operate , even for an adult . also , the plastic base broke on each of our lights ( in different places ) , so now they 're clip-less . they 're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys , though . i recommend these lights , but be careful w/ the bases
1	i am a reiki practitioner and purchased this table because it is easy to transport and very affordable . the table is nice and sturdy , sets up and breaks down easily and is lighter than some other models out on the market . a good value for the money
1	very nice . good coverage of light . lights can always be brighter in my opinion . easy installation and good battery life
0	this bike trailer seemed like a great deal . when i assembled it and tested it out it worked great , seemed very safe and comfortable . my daughter loved riding in it . initially i was very happy with the product , especially for the price paid . unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking . i would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials
1	this product does what it claims it will do . put in the time and effort - you 'll feel great ! of course , i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box . however , i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started . only doing it a few weeks , but enjoying it
0	i wish the review written in january was posted before i bought this thing . i bought this as a present and the exact thing happened . the cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use . the ad states it holds 250lbs , but when you get it ... the item states 220 , which she was still below that , but the cable snapped anyway ... .stay away from this item ... far far away .
1	my unit was really easy to install ... no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit . i drive mostly during the day so i like the unit , but those who do night driving can not see the dim light . i had to remove unit in order to pass the va state inspection . in cold weather , the temp guage sometimes does not work . also , about the temp sensor ... if you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped . behind the front license tag is great ... i put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor . that method works great . i really like the automatic calibration feature
1	i purchased this for christmas for my 8 year old son to play with . it was $ 329 with free shipping compared to $ 450 at the local sports store . the finished product looks great , appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust . i only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy , and i am mechanically inclined . practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous . it was a 4 hour assembly , with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience . but the smile on the 8 year old 's face was well worth the aggravation . on a side note , i ordered 70 % of my christmas shopping from amazon , with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date ( everything else shipped ups ) . they shipped this via dhl , which never delivered the package . i had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the dhl facility and take time off of work the friday before christmas to retrieve my son 's primary gift . i emailed amazon requesting $ 70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas , which they did in a few days . this was an oversized package that i assume ups would not accept . nonetheless , their choice of shippers reflects on amazon as a company .
1	i ordered this bike on monday and it was delivered on thursday ! the pictures of this bike do n't begin to do it justice . it has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat . i am 5'9 '' and this beauty adjusted perfectly . it is very stable and whisper quiet . i was a bit skeptical when i ordered it but what a bargain ! !
1	i 'm a small person , not a bodybuilder and hated free weights . however , i realized as i got older that i really needed to do some type of strength training . i 'd been thinking about a bowflex and after looking at the literature , decided i wanted an ultimate . i purchased a used one and do n't recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine ( long story ) . i was able to order the missing pieces from bowflex , but it took forever to get them . once i was able to use the machine , i absolutely loved it . it 's especially good for me since i 'm usually alone when i work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise/weight machines . additionally , due to a neurological problem , i had little extensor function in one hand . using the bowflex , i 've been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights . i use this faithfully every day , alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises . it 's a pleasure to use and not at all tedious . i think i probably could have done with one model under this since i never use the leg equipment . nevertheless , i 'd recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer . it 's pricey , but well worth the money
1	this was such an unusual and unique idea . i gave it as a gift , and the person really liked it ! it 's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters . the artist who made this was very creative
0	it puts out heat but not very well , maybe if it was put under a blanket in an emergency it would suffice , but by no means is it a replacment for your cars heating system .
0	these ping pong balls were a waste of money . none of them bounce correctly . they either bounce off to the side or the only bounce a couple of inches . they are also really soft , and make a terrible sound when you play with them . the seam is evident on all of them
0	we opened 2 razor bumper buggy 's for hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member . both of them were missing the charger for the battery ( and other hardware ) , so our kids could n't even play with them . they were very disappointed . what is worse , razor 's customer service is terrible ! they would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt . of course , since they were gifts , we did n't have the reciept . razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement , which wo n't be for a couple of weeks . then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers . all this hassle , all the hours on the phone , when they could have just sent us the missing chargers , like any decent company would for such a high price item ! our poor kids , just looking at their motionless bumper cars . of course , we ca n't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in februrary when we actually get to use it . happy hanukkah to you too , razor
0	this fitness mat is thick and cushy , but i find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it 's about a foot too short . my biggest complaint is that the 'washable ' cover ( a major reason i selected this product ) shrank to a completely unusable size when i washed it ( in cold water , line dried ) . now i 'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable
1	i just ordered this basket and it came in a totally different color . instead of the purple/blue it is a light aqua/blue color . the basket is still cute ... it just does n't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have . i am sure she will love it just as much ! i just wanted to give everyone the heads up !
1	we purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to jamaica . we were very happy with the us divers product . the price was right and the fins worked just as expected . they worked just as good as sets we have rented . rather than renting fins at the beach , we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean
0	the leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing . i used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring . i would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings
0	this is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box , you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed . i own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment i have had to return ... i have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products . that is until i purchased this ab-doer which was a total waste of time and money . the tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose ... the foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it `` once '' and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit ... she does not even have long nails ... the bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it , but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it , it collapses ... what 's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem . it does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless ... even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke ... it 's a screw , not a quick disconnect ... this is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are major changes done to this unit ... it 's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work ... i could n't find any reviews on these until now ... i will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves . we are the best source of honesty on the market ... save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can ... they work sooooo much better than this product ! ! ! if you do some searching , you will see some of the bad reviews about this product that are coming in ... based on amazon 's review rules , i can not list where i read them from ... have a great day everyone ! ! !
0	thi is hotimporttoys at their finest . they are advertising this as a bullet ( bb ) proof mask for use in airsoft . that leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says `` not suitable for children under 3 years . '' now , why would it say that ? this mask is meant to be a toy , yet h.i.t is saying this will stop bb 's . do n't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured , or even killed ? ? ? i think this really needs to be looked at by amazon . this could seriously kill someone
1	i already have a set of standard bones swiss , but since i was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels , i decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it . these definately firt the bill , and the with the cheap $ 35.00 price and free shipping that amazon offers , you ca n't go wrong . these may seem dissappointing at first , but after about 3-5 hours of riding , they 'll break in and go very fast . overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world
0	these ear plugs i feel were misrepresented in that the picture shows one type ( the kind i wanted ) , but what was sent to me was not at all what was in the picture . i did return them without any difficulty
1	very satisfied to find this speedometer available . perfect to put with my schwinn cruiser deluxe 7 ... ..had been searching for something like this for awhile . would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear
1	i just bought this knive and iam very pleased i bought itbecause of the tool it has like the screw driver instead of cork screw and stuff like that not to big not too small just right ! ..
1	i like this knife very much ; it 's size , shape , fit in the hand , and pocket clip are all just what i wanted . it has a nice edge and the speed safe assisted opening feature is fantastic . my only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged . i want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and i do n't want the knife springing open in my pocket . this is only a minor quibble , though . i do enjoy the knife very much ; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use , which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway . i use a different , larger knife for heavier duty use
1	this is one of the only things i have every bought sight unseen on amazon . this canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away . the carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus
0	this sender is `` 0 '' ! to me ! i bought this product on january 12th , 2007 , and today is febuary 12th , 2007 , and i still have never received it , so i want my money back or send me my product today ! ! !
0	stay away from this chain breaker . i hoped for a few uses of this breaker but instead got only half way through my first job before the handle broke and threads started to cross thread . my nashbar one was much better quality and only slightly more expensive
1	for those who may be new to suunto , they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in finland and are in use all over the world by hikers , bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds . what makes the x-lander stand out are at first glance , obviously its sheer size . let there be no illusions , the x-lander is a mighty big watch . despite its size , it does n't feel as big as it looks , though . the aluminum case is very light and quite comfortable , too . the next thing you notice would be the huge amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device . # 1 . an accurate altimeter . this is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker . one thing you must be ready to do is remember to adjust it daily . find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip , and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped ( which you can do with the internal recording function ) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day . this is not a flaw , every single altimeter watch i am aware of is exactly the same . # 2 . barometer . i found it correct at least 75 % of the time , which is more than i can say for the local tv weatherman . this includes a thermometer as well , which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat . # 3 . digital compass . this is truly one amazing feature , by the way . once you calibrate it ( which you may need to do weekly ) you will never be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map . # 4 . it tells pretty accurate time , too believe it or not . it also comes with an alarm , a countdown and a stopwatch . suddenly its size now makes sense , huh ? i happen to like big watches . i do n't exactly know why , but i just do . if i were to have any complaint whatsoever , the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive vector : a tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading . the reason why may have to do with the fact that the x-lander is mineral crystal and the vector is plastic , but either way , it 'd be nice to have . i am very impressed with just about everything associated with suunto and their fantastic line of what they call , wristop computers . if size really does matter to you , well you may wish to go with the observer or maybe the x6hr ( which does everything the x-lander and observer can do plus it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor ) both are smaller than the x-lander , vector , yachtsman and many other suunto models yet still offers a lot -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price . factor all that into your purchase plans and once again , if at all possible , do not buy until you have the chance to see some of these ( or any ) models in person . that will make a huge difference in how happy your purchase will end up being ... and good luck !
1	very , very good stroller ! and very convinient , too . this stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble . the only thing that i do n't like is that the seat can not recline or can be made straighter . my husband tried to work something out , but the thing is that the manufacturer have n't thought about it
0	these are indeed the short , static hand wraps . you do n't want static wraps , period . they 're also too short
0	i did n't read in the instructions that i was also buying a dancing partner . this thing just *will not* stay still . i tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors , but the water weight just is n't enough to keep it still . power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket . if i lived in an apartment , my neighbors would hate me . the water ends up around 200lbs ( when full ) and just does n't do the trick . i have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs , but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water . as for springiness , you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it ( by moving across the floor ) , but in my opinion it 's too springy . there is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag . it definitely needs a tension adjustment . i 'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control . i would n't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting
1	i like this for both the biking and running/walking . easy to set up the pedometer , a little harder for the bike . there 's a long cord . the front also scratched when i removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side . it 's working great though and i 'm happy with the product
0	package missing . it 's never be received . so i can not rate it
1	love this knife . looks great , sharp as can be out of the box . thin enough for the pocket of my khakis . one disclaimer , use the safety . it opened up in my pocket once ( no clue how ) and could have been dangerous
0	i might be an idiot , but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on ! haha . so many velcro straps and what not . neither me nor my father who 's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly . again ... .maybe i 'm just an idiot ... .
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
0	i road this bike for the first time today . i got to walk it home . the gear shifter boke off into my spokes and bent the rim . this bike is a unreliable piece of junk
1	this is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun . but a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections . ( they will jam the magazine ) pros : - very high cap ! more than enough for a spring gun ! cons : - a bit long , and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit . ( but still worth it
0	as a bicycle enthusiast who has owned cateye products for nearly 20 years , i eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of manhattan . unfortunately , i was rather disappointed with its overall usability . the light uses three intense bluish-white leds that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light . however , these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail , road , or pothole . in short , the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists . the flashing mode is especially easy to see . yet , the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you . hence , it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails . pros good construction multifunction waterproof cons insufficient brightness uses aaa instead of aa
0	i bought this for my 5-yr-old , and he ca n't even get it on his head . he wears other youth bike helmets , so i would n't recommend this item unless it 's for a 2-3 yr old . now i have to pay half the price in return shipping
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent ( great for hot yoga ) and very non-skid . it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands . wonderful tool
0	i bought these for my 6 yr old son last fall . a couple of them have already ripped in half and the others are n't far behind . invest a little more and buy something that will last more than a couple of months - the vinyl does n't
0	i got this pos for christmas because i was excited by the ad , the concept , and natalie gulbis . it ' a neat idea and i love gadgets . upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap , like a happy meal toy cell phone . cheap plastic and a poor lcd screen . if that were it , i could live with it , but i can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software . i have been trying all day , from different computers , and still nothing . i call the support number , sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you . this is a fairly expensive toy . you would think skygolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on r d. this thing is junk . stick with a bushnell 1500 pinseeker instead . traditional rangefinder , but it works great . nothing to crash , no support needed , and it works ! ! ! i am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow . the sad thing is , skygolf is destroying its image and reputation . if they had put a little more effort into their development , and actually had someone there to answer the phones , this could have been a really nead golf tool that people would n't mind paying for . the annual $ 20 membership fee is no problem , if it works . right now , i would n't pay $ 20 for the unit its self , let alone the membership . do n't waste your money on this ... well , i was going to call it an expensive paper weight , but it would n't even work for that ... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock .
1	yesterday i overtook a threesome at the second hole with this baby , if ya know what i mean ... those gals dropped their walkers and flocked around me . thing 's got hella acceleration too . damn
1	***** this is an upscale designer water bottle , top of the line , and so much fun . the designs of sigg 's water bottles are gorgeous , from the plain , solid color bottles , to the ones with intricate designs . they are simply beautiful ! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns , thinking it would take more work to maintain . these do necessitate regular cleaning ( i clean mine every day ) , but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun . sort of like my rings , glasses , and watch , i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory , reminding me to drink more water , making a statement about my values , and expressing myself with a special design . yes , all in a water bottle ! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality , made of light aluminum on the outside , slightly insulated , and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever , unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles . they are light , durable , and perfect for any activity . well water tastes spectacular in these bottles , just like from the tap . sigg bottles come with several different types of tops . i bought the screw top because i do n't like sports tops , and i do n't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink . it is totally leakproof , which is important to me . the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner . i get comments on it all the time , `` what 's that ? i love it ! '' the sports top version is ok ; i just am not a fan , as i do n't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top . however , for convenience , you might prefer it . for children , there is a cap-type top . all are leak-proof . if you are ever unsatisfied with the top , you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle . sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6l and 1l in this style . i have both . i use the .6l for sports activities because they are smaller . when i wo n't have to carry the container , i like the larger bottle . sigg also makes a smaller .3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people . you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too , such as .75l , .4l ( for kids ) , .6l , .5l . you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5l size , also . search amazon for the perfect size . pick a style and pattern you like , as this bottle is a personal accessory , and should reflect your style . the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon . they are expensive , but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years . i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health , so they are well worth it value-wise for me . highly recommended . ****
1	this is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout . it 's a little small for an adult , but it fits in the tent well . the only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart , but it is lightweight and comfortable
1	they get the job done , but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set
1	bought this for my husband for father 's day ! delivered in no time ! he loved it ! i let him do the registration etc . because he has more patience than i . it works very well . bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own . i love it . i have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now ! the battery went dead too soon . we called sky golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste . we even bought the $ 19.95 warranty for one year . it 's worth it !
0	i bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching tv ... i wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive . what it boils down to is that this is a `` foot hook '' tied to a bar with a nylon strap . the nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly . the idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches ... the problem is that the nylon strap does n't actually hold your feet down . i wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room . negative on both accounts . you need a good sturdy door to implement this product , and then it still does n't truly hold your feet down . looks like i 'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down
1	great product has a nice spin . ( _ ) ( _ ) =====d
1	i bought this for my brother as a christmas gift . he is an avid ballplayer , and he loves it . he says the surface feels a little different than other synthetic balls but it plays really well
0	works as advertised , except ... one of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day . no particular stress applied or anything . i 'm going to allen to see if i can get a replacement . that was my only complaint . otherwise , it 's fine . then again , breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint
1	i live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before , but with this lock i have n't had anyone even try to steal it . it 's not as heavy as i thought it would be ( a plus ) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket . it feels solid and looks strong too . i would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be
0	this is not a usable sword . this is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall . there are very few swords that can be used , among these are paul chen 's , cold steel 's and the last legend stuff . only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade
1	the science is sound , but check it out yourself . police , military , etc. , are using it , fortune 100 , other governmental agencies . schools should use it , if they do n't . it puts the kids into their best possible learning state . seriously , 5 stars is not justice . 50,000 stars . 50,000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone . the power the brain when `` coherent '' or not is tangible , and it 's driven by the heart . you can sense it in a person , anger , happiness , whatever . it 's the healing state . it 's the creative state . it 's where hormones balance .
1	this swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that i ca n't imagine it ever ripping or tearing
0	this was a very disappointing product . amazon delivered it in great time , but razor is very misleading about the quality of this product . it is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it . it is frustrating to be told by the razor customer service after the purchase , that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood . there goes the portability of it ! very disappointing !
1	this is perfect ! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it ! there 's no confusing this scooter with her sister 's ( which is pink ) . she loved it and ca n't wait to get it outside to ride all day . thanks
0	i just read an article at the fox sports website saying it is almost certain that nba will go back to using leather ball . there will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens , so in my opinion , do n't buy it
1	durability seems to be an issue . the cord breaks or unravels much too quickly . the sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball 's travel on the cord . a sleeve made of a harder , slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear . possible materials are hardened aluminum , stainless steel ( polished ) , teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate
0	the item was packaged well , but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate . the lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened . anyone want the rest of this can ? what a waste of time
1	when the buggie arrived , it did n't work . i had to call razor 's customer service dept . their service is awful . the senior agent was very rude . i managed to figure out the problem on my own . the electrical unit was not connected . once it was connected , it worked fine . we have two of them . the kids love them . they are lightweight and ride well on carpet . overall , the product is good .
0	ab lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna belt ( import junk ) . direction manual is almost useless , does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used . you will need to look at tv commercials , and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together . their web site is no help
1	my son was very happy with the product.. good quality and well worth the money .
1	if you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit . - very nice software , a lot of nice information very well presented - speed sensor is reliable and accurate ( does not suffer all kind of interfence such as gps units ) - error is really smaller than 5 % even during long runs - the information available during and after the exercise is great ( temperature , altitude , calorie count , all hrm metrics such as average , maximum , % ) - bike sensor provides speed , distance , etc - fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen
1	i would like to note i am not a fan of the riddick movie , though a blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless ! this knife is very practical , it 's a solid piece of metal all around . i own a pair of these and used them on a grounded , wooden post for hours ! yet after my use they shown no sign of bends , chips or dents ! they shipped to me dull , but hey i do n't mind sharpening them myself . a word of caution , you can seriously injure someone with these ! their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are
1	i love my treadmill ! my son put it together for me and he had no trouble . i love all the options on this treadmill . i use only the basic so far , but i can see the benefit in having the pre-programmed workouts . i ca n't wait to get there to try it ! it 's hard to say enough about this machine . it 's a great machine
0	in the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time , but now after almost no use ( except fooling with it ) it does n't remain lit for even 5 minutes . very very poor buy
1	works great . used it to drain the oil in my 2005 vw beetle tdi
1	very cute skateboard ! very girly ! the only thing wrong with it is that it 's very gritty on the top , which i 'm assuming it 's like that so that you do n't fall off , however it hurts ! ! ouch ! other than that it 's cute
1	i order this gun from hit on april 11 , and i got this baby at april 14 . quick shipping and delivery . this gun is very powerful . 350-380 fps with 0.12g 6mm bbs . very accurate too . 5/5 to hit ! and 5/5 to this gun
1	i got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and i was really excited . though , as soon as i jumped on it , it was n't bouncy at all ! i am not very happy with this trampoline , and i do n't reccomend that you buy it
0	it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i could n't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked . you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up , just like the box says it was a challenge . extremely ! i would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process . i do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position . but the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500 $ . you might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it . find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long . the nets are not worth the time nor the money , balls still fly up out of the net , you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent . with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged . dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks . the wind will always win , once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass . get bigger better deals with the real cage
0	after only one or two uses , the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts , rending themselves completely useless . i 'm very disappointed as i have another set of cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years . i would not recommend buying this set of clubs
0	i was very disappointed with the ironman speed jump rope . it is made of cheap plastic and , even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end , it 's still coiled and kinked . it 's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot . i would not buy it again , even for the low price charged by amazon
0	i bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping , since i tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet . i was in for a big disappointment . for the price that i paid compare to the other yoga mats , i was very disappointed . lesson learned , find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line . for those of you who sweats alot , do n't waste your money buying this mat .
0	i brought this pedometers for my church '' s walking program and we are not happy with them . my pedometer keeps falling off with a leach . also , the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero . if i had to buy over again , i would not buy this pedometer
0	this seems to be a pretty low-quality item . i love zelda , for certain . but , it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind . unless i missed something and link 's sword really did have a plastic handle
1	i 've owned my first pair of `` big grip '' gloves for over three years now and they 're still in great shape ( for a time i was lifting four times a week ) . i only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case harbinger discontinues them . the only down side for me is the finger length . the glove 's fingers , at least on my hands , end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in . after that , though , they 're great
0	it is reasonably accurate . the numbers displayed are formed irregularly . you ca n't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e . distance . the price is reflective of its quality
0	first of al it is not stainless steel . it has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap ... handle is not that reliable it is like it 's gon na break easily i mean do n't think of any usage . it is only for decoration .
1	i bought the swim goggle for my wife as a gift and she loves the product . it is a lot better than the swim goggle you would buy at a store . i recommend this product for those who swim as part of their exercise routine
0	these skates are very comfortable ... but within ten minutes the stopper had busted . no wonder this item is no longer being sold . :
0	bought mine sometime around christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to st thomas last week . it died within 10 minutes of being in the water . it was never more than 5 ' down while i was snorkeling . while i never tested the compass or thermometer against known `` accurate '' ones , it seemed to work well enough for my purposes . just keep it dry
0	the idea is great for my son who studies karate , but the quality of the product is below sub par . the pump broke two pumps into blowing the thing up . i spent the better part of the night hallucinating while blowing up this thing . everyday it had to be blown up again without the pump ! i told my son it was garbage and said he could practice on his big sister . do n't cheap out with this
1	i 've been shot by many other airsoft guns , but this one really packs a punch ... my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic . the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead , it will scare you that you broke it , but no , it 's just the dead battery . the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast . this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble , but be patient , it 's actually easier than it looks . i highly recommend this gun
0	these are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on television . the cardio video is entirely too fast . i teach aerobics twice a day and it 's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner could n't keep up . also , the music is really boring . i use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd
1	i after drooling over this watch for two years wishing i had one , i finally got one and have had my advizor for two months now . all i can say is that if i had known how cool this thing really was , i would have shelled out the $ 300 a long time ago . each one of the features listed above does everything you could want . the heart rate monitor has target zone settings , average workout heart rate , highest and lowest hear rate , and more . the altimeter tells your rate of ascent , total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory . the coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate , altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate . i got completely geeky with this information after one workout , and i typed it all into my computer so i could see what it looked like . the only drawback to the advizor is that it gives you so much information , it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis . there is no pc link , so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand . but other than that , this gizmo is perfect . no problems at all so far and i use the thing for two workouts a day . i am a cross country ski racer and for a long time i had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that i have tried it i know that it is
1	this bench was the best combination i could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises . it works suprisingly well for what it costs . the lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises , and set higher for sit ups . the padding and covers seem decent . lots of adjustments . it 's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms , but for at home i am satisfied
1	for the price and relative ease of use , this is a decent starter net . the five foot height/width makes it a little small for older youth . it is easy to fold , carry and store , which is a huge plus - especially compared to other so-called portable nets . it deploys fairly easily enough , though the support pole set-up is not completely intuitive . the set i puchased had no instructions , so it was n't until after several uses that i completely figured it out . all in all , however , i am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise
1	this item was perfect for my son , who is advancing in skateboarding and tricks !
1	this is the harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then i suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves . if you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats , deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the harbinger 140 pro wristwrap glove is exactly 100 % what you need . i would never , and i mean never , buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove i have used has split within two months of use while harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day i bought them . the wrist strap is a really nice touch , very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts . you go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer ... look no further . buy them
1	any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement . just the way it is . so if you think you can by pass this point , than forget it . but if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand . the biggest debate is water or sand ? does it really make a difference ? the best tip i can give is not matter of which one but what 's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use . when considering water or sand ... . water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy . if you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand , than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement , there 's an answer for everythin
0	we received this product for christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke . we contacted schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console . it is now may 1st and the console we need is still on backorder -- - 5 months ! ! ! ! ! it is absolutely ridiciulous . i call each week and i get the same response . unfortunately , we should have contacted amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from amazon . lesson learned there . the product when it was working was fine . but the pain since then is not worth it . i do not recommend this product
0	i purchased two of these , one for each of my sons . i received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape . when we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok . but the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds . got it charging , we think . then we start on the second one . we take it out and the charger is half melted . ok , not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same . well , when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt ! nevermind that the house could have caught on fire ! so apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened , rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger . nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective . the first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged , we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had . when it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour , with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump . and the light did n't work . while trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up . we ca n't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted . when we first took these out of the boxes they were small ( big enough for a 3 or 4 year old ) but they looked pretty sturdy , much better than the plastic ones you get from walmart , and i paid close to the same amount . they were difficult to get out of the packaging , because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart , but that should have been good , to protect during shipping . however when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired . i will admit that i have n't tried to return them . i am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already . i am tempted though , because i would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money . imagine how dissapointed i was that right before christmas i could n't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk . i am very upset . so now several hundred dollars ( times two ) that could have bought very nice christmas presents just flushed down the drain .
0	the product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam , they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch . we did n't even bother to blow the thing up , utter junk , returned for something cheaper and better put together ( we hope ) . if i could give this a negative star rating i would .
0	how can this table be used with face hole ? either -- 1 ) use no sheets , ie client lies directly on vinyl , or 2 ) fitted sheet covers hole , ie client can not breathe . neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable
1	i bought the wave about 1 week ago and i got the hang off it in 3 days now i master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money ( im 10 years old
0	we bought this for my 7yr old son , and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it . thank goodness we had it on a tile floor . he kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water ! what a mess . not worth the money
1	this is a great stroller and an awesome price on amazon . i wish i had it 2 years ago . it folds nicely and is n't very heavy to lift in my van . i use it for walking and the swivel wheel is great
0	really , folks , spend the money on a gym membership , go outside and play with your dog , play soccer with your kids , or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk . be reasonable . just remain aware of how your body feels , know your limits ( i.e . knees , back , elbows ) and do n't over do it ! it takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management . you can do it your own way . you do n't need this thing at all . this product will not bring you any satisfaction . you 'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could 've been watching saturday morning cartoons ! ! ! in the infomercial it shows you `` all the machines '' you have to use at the gym . well , there 's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true . those machines , well worth the cost of a membership , guide the user in producing precision movements . they cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy . you 're better off using machines at the gym ( hey , do n't forget the ymca ) , varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise , and throwing in consistant measures of pilates and yoga , if you want to `` change your body . '' this is just another stupid product , we 've seen them come and go for years . it wo n't be around long , folks ... disappoint will occur , and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility .
1	this may be the 'outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it 's big , it 's ugly , but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy . overall , i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are . the timepiece : outstanding . it has hh : mm : ss dd : mmm , of course , with a year setting to avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying in a modern digital watch . stopwatch with lap function ( not that i ever use the lap function , but i 'm sure someone is interested ) . countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown ( very easy to set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos for the alarms , this is one of the loudest watch alarms i 've heard , and i 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this . the altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind of neat . over four days , my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level ( by the maps , about 40m asl ) . not surprising because it is driven by the barometer , and i never recalibrated it , but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it . the barometer : yup , it 's a barometer . the part i like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend , especially as this is always active ( even in normal 'time ' mode ) . the thermometer : take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist . the compass : easily the best 'special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough for orienteering , not for surveying ) , easy to use . it can be programmed for a declination , but knowing me , i 'd forget to reset it , so i do declination the hard way . the sighting notches are small but servicable . the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto , and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass . an outstanding wrist compass . the package : big . really , really big . but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing ( a problem for me with other watches ) . the battery has a shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but has a hatch , so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance . the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground , and the display light is just right , readible , even , and glare free , but not an emergency flashlight . personally , i 'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap , but the stock strap is n't bad , just not great . overall , not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch , compass and barometer , and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter . well designed , thought-out , and manufactured , but really big .
0	i measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup
0	i thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope , it was n't , it was pretty limp . for the price i suppose i got what i paid for .
1	i have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather . over the years i have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size . this cot will provide everthing that i 'm looking for . my sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot . the cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag . the only down side to the cot is it 's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag . in short it 's all a good fit and i hope to enjoy it for years to come . thanks da
1	these are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and i also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops . i am not a diabetic , but i have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when i get it i use this or something else to get it back up fast so i can be comfortable . this really works and tastes great too . they really did well with this product . i like to go geocaching and i get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when i need quick fuel
0	i received my cage net on august 12 06 i set it up on aug.16.i hit about 50 golf balls into it and one of the tabs that holds the black tarp tore loose.i then noticed that there was a hole in the netting.where is the quality
1	i 've owned a gust buster for over 5 years now and it works great . i 've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended . i like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do . mine is n't automatic , so maybe that 's a problem , but every automatic umbrella i 've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand
1	the directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up . however , at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement ( i.e . driving to work ... ? ? ) therefore , for the most part , its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps i take each day has been invaluable .
1	these are just as good as everyone says - smooth as silk and very quick . just to give you an idea , i get a good 40-50 feet of travel from one push using these bearings . they really are the best value out there
0	i was extremely disappointed when i received this product . contrary to the description , the handles are hard plastic - not `` comfortable and soft '' as it states on the product packaging and website . other than that it may be a decent product , but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin . i 've already printed the label to return to amazon . beware the other review of this product , the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on amazon . not only is it not informative , there is a good chance they have never tried the product
1	this is the best ! i love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves . its made me a better runner . my husband loves when i take it to his tight shoulders ... i can massage him so much longer than i could before . this is a great purchase
0	our daughter got one of these for christmas . she 's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel ( which is make out of plastic ) broke . i regret paying what i did for this one , not because of what the going price is now but because it 's a piece of junk . do not buy this piece of crap
0	the design of the bed is awesome . unfortunately it would not hold air . there were no visible flaws . the instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used . the bed would not hold air at all . ( i only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st ) i purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing . i love the design but i am disappointed in the quality
0	these knives are terrific , unless you actually want to use them . i threw these knives into soft pine wood and they bent like crazy . one of them bect almost 180 degrees ! if you want to throw these into something softer ( like pillows ) these may work , but do n't expect to throw these into wood
1	highly recommended ! ! ! ! my wife uses this pack for nursing school . as you can imagine she carries a lot of `` stuff '' . this pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps . i would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school
1	the one i bought is green and black - looks good in the water . i first look this kayak ( dingy really ) out into the gulf of mexico . the swells were two two three feet and the harder i paddled the behinder i got . i thought i had made a bad purchase but then i took the dingy into clearwater bay with much calmer waters and i 'm having the time of my life . paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but i 've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay . i bought a coleman pump that runs on 4d batteries and i can inflate and deflate it five times before i need to change batteries . this kayak is the best $ 70 i 've ever spent . great exercise too
0	i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does . i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials . the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring . im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp . i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all . u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price
1	i used to try to strengthen my fingers using the gripp balls , and later , the gravity gripp , which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights . however , they were bulky , hard to get a grip on , and heavy and pretty silly looking . so , when i saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog , i ordered one right away . they are about the same price of the grip balls , but they are so much cooler ! not only is this good for fitness training , they 're even better for musicians ! ( my instrument is piano . ) these are light and flat and they fit right into a purse . i do n't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks , i just let them try it , and they are immediately hooked . i carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend , when i gave it away to a friend . it is difficult to know which tension to use . i 'm a woman with small hands , and found that i am right between the blue and the red . i use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger ( left hand ) . i can usually handle the red one for everything else , but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension . i use mainly the blue one now . i hope to work up to the red , but that will be a while . i 'm also going to buy a couple more so i can work both hands simultaneously . i do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly . do n't overdo it , or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho . like any weight training , you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles . do n't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed . i found that if i started to cheat , i got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis . ( another reason i 'm staying on the blue tension for now . ) oh , and buy your gripmaster here at amazon . they are $ 15 each everywhere else
0	my husband bought this for me for christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product . i used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about . then , without warning , the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off . when my husband called the company , he was told that the parts ( including the pedal and cable ) were only guaranteed for 90 days , and the frame for 3 years . in other words , there was nothing they would do about it . when i called , they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge , but i would have to pay shipping and handling . that was today , i 'm still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s reimbursement . this gave me a great workout so i was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman ( and i only used it about 3x per week ) . i 'm hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem ... and i 'm hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product
0	small holes , unstable , no space for the bum . my daughter cried everytime we tried it . we had a pool school deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared . she loved that one . i could not find it in the store so i bought the swim school and am regretting it . buy the pool school !
0	the literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars . hardly . my vehicle is a 2006 gmc envoy with a factory roof rack . this rack is the same one used on many gm suvs , so great numbers of them are out there . these racks have crossbars with a `` reverse wing '' shape that are tilted forward , presumably to reduce wind noise . the thule `` universal '' mounting system will not conform to these crossbars , and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward ( or backward ) at a silly angle . it can be used in this conformation , but it looks odd . also , the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards , but the mounts are not lock-protected , so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches . my searches found no alternative to this rack , however , and it does work for the intended purpose
1	great . if you need more mags , get this , it fits perfect . it is exactly what it says it is
1	... or shall we shag later ? now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me i would n't have to bend over at all ! but seriously , i find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that i was using . i have n't used it on real grass though , just on the practice mat and net i have set up in my garage . given the consistent way the shag pro serves 'em up , i think it would also work fine out back
1	this is the perfect monitor for the average person . the chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so i do n't have to look at the watch while using the machines . while walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate . i have n't used the other features that are offered so i ca n't rate them , but it does everything that i wanted out of it when i purchased it
0	i purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and i and they both stopped working on the same day ! we only had them 10 days and when they went kaput
0	first , the directions on assembling this product were in impossible to understand chinglish . 2nd , the gun broke immediately upon use . hot import toys never answers their phone and never returns calls . they will not help you . do n't throw your money away on this one
0	these balls are horrible , they do n't bounce like regular balls , worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight , it goes to the sides most of the time
1	what a beautiful bicycle ! ! i thought it was black and white from the photo but it 's a really lovely forest green and white . it was really easy to put together myself . my husband is really excited about it . he 's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser . very happy with this purchase ! great price too ! my own schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much .
0	highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business , which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works . so what do they do with this item ? they sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass -- so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass . ( this leads to the problem noted by an earlier reviewer . ) i bought this model to replace a previous version ( no clock ) -- the battery had run down and there was no way to replace it . which brings up another point : why an alkaline battery instead of lithium . dumb . but even more strange is that the earlier version had non-ferrous split rings and the compass worked fine -- so highgear is not even maintaining the qc they had a year or two ago . also , at least one of the buttons on my sample is pretty dodgy . s1 - by which you set time , date , etc . -- does not work well . sometims it ignores input , and other times it registers two hits with one press . all together , this product is the result of very poor design and manufacturing specifications , and/or very poor quality control . please do n't expect to much functionality from this product
0	the foam rubber on my handles is shredding on the edges after only one month . not worth the money
0	since i have received this piece of s**t i have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working . you have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message
0	i bought one outside amazon , and charged it 15 hours . my mini maglite had more power . the battery never worked . do n't waste your money . better pay a little more , but for something that works
0	i gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf . this pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it . it has problems that need modification . the top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body , making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb . that means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely . remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it . add some adhesive velchro to the back of the case . make a fabric band for your ankle . attach the ends to each other with velchro . put a strip of velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band . i get accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline . the hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring . the strut is made of thin brass . aluminum from a soda can would work , too . i made a `` v '' in one end of the strut to hold the spring . i pushed lightly against the spring from the left side , drilled a hole in the brass , and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board . the strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it . i now have quite a few miles on the pedometer . ( i have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely . ) several times the pedometer reset itself to `` 0 '' for no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed on the reset button . one incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security . once it reset while i was walking . twice it reset while i was napping on the sofa . i am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit , but i do not know . static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses a counter circuit . if someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter , connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts . connect a button switch to the two wires . freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
1	i bought it through the target -amazon store , which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors . its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension ( by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit ) . to me it was exactly as advertised , a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well . i do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device
1	i have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years . i am pleased with the product . it 's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast . it 's as practical as can be for what i got it for ! it also is very compact and light in the pack . the one piece of advice i have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size . the additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it
0	this watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood ' , but i am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather . i was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone . i can not recommend this watch for the price it sells for , even if the altimeter worked correctly .
0	scary looking but inpractical . the wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already ( if your fists are that big you do n't need claws ) . the talon shaped blades are sharp but ca n't dig in , they can only scratch . they even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard . nice wall decor but nothing more
1	great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard . it provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends . another product that i found quite valuable is `` the ultimate golf instruction guide : key techniques for becoming a zero handicap golfer or better '' by patrick leonardi this book has very practical information on the short game and long game , which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course . for leisure reading , i also suggest `` new rules : polite musings from a timid observer '' by bill maher this book is hilarious , very funny observations about famous people in the world
0	the dimensions of this bookbag where not stated . the bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts . i had to pay double shipping sending it back . a big disappointment
1	this gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge . although the clip only holds 30 rounds , the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough . but please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s -- - . i recommend blowing it up . anyway to answer that person 's question the cocking handle is just for looks . now back to my review . the scope does not have red crosshairs as i 've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws . the foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position . overall this is a great gun and i would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it 's only $ 30
1	the computer is really good and installs quite easily . the only problem is the setting instructions for the functions ( in 11 languages ) . they are not very good ( as noted in another review i read )
0	i do n't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as i am with the swing groover ii . last night i went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs , just so i could verify the accuracy of the swing groover . i was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time , occasionally hitting 200 . my 7-iron was flying about 165 yards . tonight , i just finished setting up the swing groover . my first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards . i warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron . these swings produced readings of 121 yards , with an average of 121 . this product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit . the yardage is off by about 50 yards , but believe it or not , i think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate . with the 5-iron , it was indicating a little over 70 mph . i 've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph , so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable . i 'm not sure if i just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is , but i 'm very disappointed . i 'm very inclined to think i just wasted $ 150 . my suggestion is to keep looking for other products , because this one is horribly inaccurate
1	i do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand . i weigh 185 pounds . no creaks bends or falls , great produc
1	it 's an ok knife . that picture of it can trick you . if you look at the middle of the page , it says `` we ship black if we are out of silver '' . do n't get me wrong , black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green . the odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery , so i hope you like black weapons . the tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley . just try not to poke an eye out . when will you need a led light on a sword ? ? ? unless your fighting ninjas in the dark . do you know why this weapon is so cheap ? i think that it 's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive . just do n't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine . p.s . if you 're looking at my account name , i am not neil meislin but i am related to him .
1	i 'm not really a golf player . but what i saw of the golf set was that the bag 's cover protection from rain has a missing zipper stopper
0	i bought this unit two months ago and since that time i have used it sparingly . i went to turn it on today and it was dead . so i went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one . still dead . i tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice , unlike this so called 'rugged ' unit . a total waste of money , be forwarned
0	to describe these as `` light and cheap '' is exactly right . and neither is a compliment . my thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular ( 3 or 4 times a week ) use . the foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges . after picking up several chunks of foam off the floor , i learned that tying my own handles at the end of the thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free . these handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for . save your money
1	this is one of the best weightlifting gloves that i have found so far ! ! i like it so much , that i 've bought a few pairs . these have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury . the rest of the glove is terrific . it is thicker around the palm and fingers , so it provides excellent cushioning for those heavy lifts . i have not had one blister , or redness since i 've started using these gloves , and i 've been using them for over a year now . they are extremely comfortable . after a year of use , my gloves are still in perfect condition too . i 've tried other brands , and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers , and this causes redness and blisters , so what 's the use of using them ? on the other hand , this valeo ocelot wrist wrap weightlifting glove is perfect in every way ! ! has support , comfort , and it looks great . i have the orange pair ( glow ) , and i get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look . well worth every penny . way to go valeo !
0	took it out of the box , took 5 minutes to set it up , and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall during its first use . i definitely would not let children use this item without supervision . the bar itself is of good quality . but the brackets have to go
0	even though they look pretty cool , these mirrors are hard to focus , and even harder to see anything in
1	this little trike is wonderful ! ! ! my 2 1/2 year old loves it , as does our 5 year old neighbor . the ride is smooth , and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers , without the high risk of tipping over . i looked for a trike for many hours/days , and am so happy with this choice
1	i have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space . i like to have different places to put different materials . this gives me the opportunity to do so . i like the fact that i can put my ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books i use . i would say that the area where you hold the smaller items , such as pens and calculators , is nice . you have dividers where you can hold many different things . overall , this is the best pack for school i have come across
1	this is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping . you have to remember it is not a crock-pot though , the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware - i did n't . therefore , a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product , certainly this is not the product 's fault but owner error . a very good product , highly recommended for campers and tailgaters
1	these were purchased for a client who has severe arthritis and works outdoors . our winters here are very cold and he found he had much less pain in his hands and fingers using these gloves
0	the only reason i am rating this stroller a 1 is amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds . it actually is only 50 pounds . it is now being returned
1	the `` traditional '' spork never impressed me much . this thing is a spoon with a useful fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there . consider - the spork 's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing , typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office , or the stuff in your wide-mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite . the light my fire spork fits the bill to perfection
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat ( a shortened m-4 ) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . take a pass on airsplat . the sight seems ok for the price .
1	i 've had ab sonic for three years . i bought it at target . it 's great . it allows me to have a productive workout , while i 'm working overtime to be productive
0	this gun sucks ! -it has the worst range out of all the ones i own . when i lob it , i can only shoot twenty feet . -fps sucks . i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it does n't hurt . -flimsy . no joke , i dropped it when i was playing , and it shattered . -accuracy is a joke . i have a walled backyard , and i was at one end . when i lobbed it , i hit the the wall once ( 20 ft away . ) i fired it again ( twice ) and i hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark . -the one `` good '' thing about this gun is the price . 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces
0	in the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time , but now after almost no use ( except fooling with it ) it does n't remain lit for even 5 minutes . very very poor buy
0	the specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation . well if there any , i sure could n't find them . not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment . the bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time . i 'm very sorry that i purchased this bag
1	the previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this dvd . i thought i would add a few additional comments . first , you get a lot of bang for your buck with these $ 50 cathe dvds - they are definately worth the money . this dvd has 3 full workouts - boot camp , muscle endurance and a combo ( of the 2 ) . there are also a number of other options on the dvd menu . i workout regularly with a variety of videos/dvds but i 'm not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own . there is some light barbell work on sevaral of the firm cross training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust . i found cathe 's dvds when searching on amazon . when i saw the description for this dvd it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment i have but the price was really challenging . i decided to take a chance and go for it . needless to say , i was very impressed and i even ordered another $ 50 cathe dvd . if you have the equipment ( barbells , dumb-bells , a high step/firm step and maybe even a medicine ball ) and you enjoy an hour of resistance training , i would highly recommend this dvd . it 's challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level . there is some intense ab work on this dvd too . if you do n't have one , you might want to purchase the `` heavy resistance theraband exercise band '' for $ 7.49 through amazon when you order this dvd . cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing/bands are n't a good subsitute . although there is no price difference between amazon and cathe 's website , when ordering through amazon , the cathe dvds/videos are shipped priority mail . on cathe 's website usps is not an option so they wo n't ship to a po box . if you live outside the continental us their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in hawaii .
1	this is the best anti-chafing product i 've ever used . i 'm a 40 something marathon runner , heavier than the average marathoner . every marathon i ran left me with a bloody chafed mess on my thighs-i just ran my first marathon with this product and not a chafe-my highest recomendatio
1	hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack
0	great use for five minutes then one broke . having use kendo shinai bamboo swords before i would not suggest these and only bought them as i had a $ 25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of
1	a little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1 ' size tiles ( which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space ) . that said , these floor mats are really great ! i wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics step workouts as well as pilates , yoga , weighted workouts , etc . these fit the bill absolutely perfectly ! ! ! they are stiff enough that there 's no danger of ankle instability because of a too-soft surface , but they are soft enough that when you do floor work , they provide excellent cushioning . my knees used to kill me when i would do a runner 's stretch , but now i actually go `` ahhhh '' as i 'm doing them , which is great . not even a smidge of discomfort . they are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high-impact activities . talk about an ankle , knee , and hip saver ! the only discomfort i still notice and i really think it 's just me ) is during floorwork when i 'm on my side to do leg lifts , i have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter ( bony prominence at the top of the femur ) . but i am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently , so again , i really think it 's just me . anyway , i just ca n't say enough good things about these mats -- i highly recommend them . now -- to address the title of my review ... .. my only complaint about the mats -- and i 'm echoing another recent reviewer on this -- is that when i first put them down , they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors . because they are not completely wall-to-wall in the configuration i had them , this was a problem . i was able to solve the problem completely , though , by buying one of those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads that you can get very inexpensively . i found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick , as well . but i would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping . in short , if you have hardwood floors like me ( i do n't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface ; you 'd have to see another review to check on that ) , i highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti-slip pad to put underneath . also , if you do , be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat ( or very close to it ) . otherwise , if you come down on a part that 's not protected during a lateral move , you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance . a little expensive , but really worth the investment in my opinion . happy sweating to you ( or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for ) . :
1	this is one of the best pogo sticks on the market.you can go about 6 feet high , jump off of stairs
1	i purchased two of them for my twin boys , and they really love it . it is made pretty strong and can be folded easily . the only negative point is that the wheeler can not be extended too much . so probably we will need to buy a taller one in a few years
1	this gun is really cool ! it has decent aim , great fire power , and the charge lasts a long time . the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb 's at a time , but hey , you ca n't have everything . anyways , great buy
0	i live in argentina . i bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa . the watch does n't work and i ca n't change it or sent it back to usa
0	the cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places , which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company . a fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched . the front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire . a required tool , a 5mm allen wrench , was not provided . i have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated , however , the bike seems to perform adequately as is .
1	i bought this stroller after much research and deliberation . it is comfortable for my [ ... ] as well as my [ ... ] daughter . it handles wonderfully . it folds pretty well too . the front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature . i am tall and it helps to have the handle where i need it . i have used this for both walking , shopping and jogging and think it is perfect ! from purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days . i am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase . i love this stroller !
0	this is the most horrible product i have ever bought in my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it
1	this ninja sword is nice and has a light on it that makes it even coole
0	great feedbacks from j. leigh . this sword is for display only . try swinging it around and you 'll see what happens . they should add that to the description .
1	the pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price . the odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate . the set-up and operations get easier with use ( first few times you will need to refer to the manual ) . the manual is well written and thorough . the cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate
0	advertised as having a coaster brake , not . advertised as having a 6 speed , not , has a 5 speed . if i would have known this , i would have opted for something else .
1	these are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim . they offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on . i taught swimming for years and this is the product i 'd recommend
1	i am very please with my purchase . it is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color
1	we purchased the razor scuttle bug trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it ! she spends hours each day zipping around on it , and it is sturdy and lightweight . my only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height . she is a bit tall for her age , and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches . would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35 '' tall . item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat . highly recommended
0	these really suck i shot my lil brother in the head point blank it didnt hurt i was holding him as a hostage beacuase we play that way his teamate stuck a m16 macine gun to my head i told him to back off or ill shoot i shot and the damn bb did not come out i got a big welt on my head for 5 days and got in big troble beacuse i was trying to shot the brat
0	i bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews , big mistake ! the cardio boot camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing . the beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun . if i knew what was n't included i would n't have bought it . they should list what 's not included in the description . it seems somewhat deceptive
1	our very busy toddler ( 17 months old ) is having a good time with this scooter . it is very well made especially for the reasonable price . the wheels do not scratch our wood floors , unlike some of her other toys . she is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys . this one is one of the better ones . the only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground . she is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet . our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months . once they are in their twos , our girls have preferred trikes , so i 'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite ' , but it can definately be 'handed -down ' or given to friends as it is going to last for years
1	powerbars were created out of necesity to be efficient , not to taste like a $ 2.50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out . if you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food - eat food ; like a steak , a piece of cake , or a banana . power bars were made for energy in the 1980 's ; people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them . power bars are practically synonymous with the term `` energy bar '' because they are the time honored benchmark . try a cliff bar or a snickers if you are looking for something tasty ; when you get tired of those and long for something more in life , try a powerbar
1	this sword is awesome . i thought it would be cheap metal because of the price , but it is even better than some of the other swords i bought for more money
0	you can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours . forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride , because of the adapter it only charges while its on the machine . there is no seperate battery charger .
0	let me just start by saying this gun is terrible . the images are misleading ; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic , but it is a dull black . and it smells really badly at first . not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps , and is sold at 300 . my friends did n't even notice being shot . i have a 300 fps pistol , it leaves welts through jeans . this isnt 300 fps . it 's a rifle fit for an infant who 's been dropped on their head and thinks it 's good . never even shot farther than 80+ feet . bad buy
1	overall this is a great little knife . it opens fast , is very sharp and holds it 's edge well and feels good in your hand . the liner lock is great . i have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate . this one is smooth as silk and located in a great position . very nicely designed . i did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver . first , i reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction i was used to on my spyderco knives . second , the safety had to go . i found it slipped to the `` on '' position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly . not because it was difficult to operate , rather it is tiny and hard to find blind . if you like the safety though , it definitely does prevent the blade from opening accidentally . speaking of safety ... the knife arrives razor sharp . i opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar . the tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback . be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade . i am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh
0	i was very dissastisfied with the product . the 16 inch dora bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter . we had to keep it in the box until christmas eve , so that she would n't find it . when i started assembling it that night , we found no training wheels or seat . i was very upset for obvious reasons , how do you tell a 4 yr old that santa forgot the seat and training wheels for her bike
0	i really think i wasted money for buying this stuff ... ..it 's just worthless and not working at all .
0	i loved the machine - until it broke . there 's no friggin ' technical support or repair options from schwinn . they do n't care .
0	face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on . watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks . i 've been wearing a cheap casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it . other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly , for example when i put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat ; also , the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive , with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch . finally , the watch is very well photographed in the ad , and does n't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality
0	i have had two of these units ( sg2 and an sg4 ) and all i can say is `` do n't believe the hype '' . while the units are an unbelievable concept on tv and work ( note : when they work ) great , the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by skygolf is , by itself , sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena . just to relay my experience ( and keep in mind i have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units ) , it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original sg2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software ( ie-endless restarts ) . when the sg2 was stolen at an event , i purchased an sg4 to obtain the next generation of the product . since the january 2 , 2007 , purchase date , i have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours ( including one saturday morning , prior to a sunday event , when they requested i attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5am ( no , that is not a typing error on my part ! ) california time ) . i have purchased/received ( skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation ) and returned three sg4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged . i have attempted to download the software and access the website via the sg4 on five different computers and every single service pack of microsoft windows 2000 . even after i forwarded skygolf the computer log to show them the problem ( software error ) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational . at this point , all i can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating ( to echo another review ) it is to deal with the people behind the product . no product , no matter how fabulous in concept , is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation . good luck to you if you purchase the product . i hope your experience is better than mine .
1	i am saving this until this summer ! i ca n't wait to use it
1	got ta say i love this step and even more so the deal : not only do you get the step , but you also get four raising-blocks *and* a step-workout dvd -- all for under $ 50 ! ! ! i think that 's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment ( i think it was $ 70-80 for the pro step and $ 40-50 for two raising blocks , plus $ 15 for a dvd ... that 's , like , $ 140-150 ! ) . the step *is* smaller than the steps you 're probably used to from the gym , but it 's not *that* much smaller -- i would say it 's about 25 % shorter length-wise . it 's got ta be though , i mean it 's an at-home step so they 're making it more storable . i guess if you 're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first , but i do n't see how you could n't adjust to it . then again , i 'm 5'2 petite so for me it 's the perfect size ! haha : p the dvd is pretty good . it 's pretty simple , basic stepping though , so if you 're an advanced stepper you 'll probably get bored real fast . however , it does get you to sweat a little , so it 's not a complete waste . if not for the stepping , though , keep it for the abs workout -- omg it 's amazing ! ! for only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide . haha which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but flat . : ) but really , it 's a good dvd , especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but do n't want to ( at least not too hard ) . lol buy this kit , it 's a *great* deal and it 'll get you in shape ! :
0	i bought this item a few weeks before hurricane wilma hit south florida ... i kept it charged for 2 weeks without using it at all ... after the storm hit and i tried to use it that night ... the spotlight stayed on for only 20 mins tops before it totally ran out of power luckily the car charger was in the box and the lantern light worked very well on a full charge ... but i do not give praise to this item at all and i gave it the credit it deserved the 1 star is for the lantern and not the spotlight ... crappy at best ... please do not bu
0	although they claim that this item can be used by adults , it is the furthest thing from the truth . you can only fill the black bottom half up with water , which you would n't know until you buy it . due to this , you ca n't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its ' side with even the most mild of punches . also , after a few hits , it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on . the only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that i have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment . this is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag . save your twenty five dollars for something else
0	this sounds great in theory , being that you do n't have to get under the car to drain the oil . fantastic ! but while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars , i do n't quite agree . you still have to get under the car to change the oil filter , so i 'd suggest saving $ 50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car , which is actually faster than using this device .
0	disliked table . each time table was set-up , legs had to be attached by the support rods . this was not an easy process nor done quickly . the face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable . 1 star for this item is too much for my usage and review . i sent it back
0	i was disappointed in this product , and returned it - and bought `` crank '' type no-battery flashlights instead . there were two things i disliked about the diamond flashlight . first , the light lasted a very short time - after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes ( they recommend just 90 sec . for a full charge ) , i turned the light on , and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless . i tried this a couple of times , with the same results . the other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec . turns out to be a lot more work than you would think ! i am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights i replaced these with
0	ok so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i 'm so excited . then i play with it , its working then i go to charge it boom . 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work . i checked the battery it has full juice . i had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out . currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it . do not buy this gun or any other toys or airsoft guns from this company ! please do n't buy this it is a rip of and the company has terrible customer reviews ! that is my review and i am a kid and im doing this on my moms nam
1	working out used to be heh for me , but after getting the door gym i made a rule . anytime i enter my bathroom ( which is where it is suspended ) either before or after i have to do 10 pull-ups and 10 neutral pull-ups , also since i purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well . it 's working wonders , within the first week of doing pull-ups where i 'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up i 'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups . i 'm very happy with this product , only downside ( which i personally do n't really care about ) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side , the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls . so anyway ... i highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work : p easy workout
1	i am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet , but my carpeting did not have enough padding so i decided to order an exercise mat . i a very please with my order . i noticed the difference right away . the cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome .
1	does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem . instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks . the active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately . has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal
1	these are brand new and brand name . i ordered late on wed and received by sat . ca n't buy them any cheaper nor get them faste
0	this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else . the `` first '' unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable . after a number of calls to tech support , it was decided to return and replace the unit . amazon promptly replaced the treadmill . this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function . my friend at tech support did not have a clue . he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit . it is not clear what i am to do with them . i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer
0	it may say `` slow cooker '' on the front of the item , but i assure you , it is anything but slow ! i was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me ! so , i made my hungarian ghoulash in it , glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach . all i can say is , thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later , or we would n't have had anything but charcoal left , had we left the campsite that day without checking it ! it was cooking on low , and it was literally done in a half hour 's time . so , keep in mind , if you are camping and you have n't tried using this product yet , it wo n't take long before your meal is done . sadly , my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at did n't have electricity , hence why i wanted a propane crock pot .
0	this is a cool gun but ... has no acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations
1	hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product , it raelly goo
1	great for the price paid . kid loves this sqarepants products
0	i bought this based on the other review . it takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor . all through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft . i am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated . do n't waste your money like i did
0	made of a soft steel , the legs ' attachment is a bit flimsy , so it leans forward too much . may not accommodate bikes with disk brakes ( the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening ) . i had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26 '' mountain bike
1	a quality product . low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over . easy to assemble . ca n't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside ! have been riding it inside , mostly using our legs ( we 're not yet 2 yrs old ) to scoot around . however , our bigger cousin ( just turned 5 yrs old ) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars . this trike will last a long time and thru many kids
1	the bad news first : the extension cables are very stiff , and they 're shipped in a tight loop . do n't expect them to straighten out easily . and they do n't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps . i just swap cables from whichever bowflex station i 'm not using and get a much better feel . the ball ... is a ball . it does the job . the little pump they supply with it is n't great , but it also does the job . maybe you 'll tone your arms pumping up the ball . ; - ) there 's no check valve in the ball , so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in fast , once it 's fully inflated . the mat looks a bit cheap , but it 's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around . the video is decent . even if you already know what you 're doing , it 's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a bowflex . so far , i would n't say you 've even come close to justifying the purchase price . but those foot straps are just brilliant ! once you 've gotten them adjusted , they 'll go on and off with no problem , making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum . but once you have them secured they wo n't come off , or even shift much , when you 're performing the exercises . that may sound like no big deal , but i 've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements . the four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid . i 've been doing resistance stretches for a long time , and these are the best straps i 've ever used . they 're worth the price of admission
0	my husband bought me this for christmas , and we were both disappointed . the graphics are awful , some give me a headache . the songs are awful -- they all sound alike . its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard . the pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly . i 've had it two weeks , and already i 'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss . i gave it two stars because my kids ( ages 6 and 2 ) love it , but then again , they do n't know any better . i am using it to get better at ddr , but then i will invest in a better pad and game .
0	there was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation . i purhased a crank puller tool for $ 21.44 ( incl tax ) , a crank wrench for $ 18.18 ( incl . tax ) , and grease for $ 6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle . upon disassembly i found two ( 2 ) metal shavings , each about 0.25 inches in size , that appeared to be from drilling . i have saved the two ( 2 ) metal shavings . i removed the metal shavings , cleaned and re-greased , and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed . since this was a brand new bicycle , it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it . the total cost , not including and labor , is $ 46.00 .
1	this item arrived within a few days of purchase . it is a great value for the price . i did have to assemble it from pictures , but got it together without any outside assistance . i plan to use it along with the reformer i already own . i do wish that there was a cd or chart with basic exercises for this product . their customer service was quick and helpful , when i had a component arrive damaged by the shipper
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack . it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried . i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books . a little more padding in the straps ( or smaller textbooks ) would make it perfect , but it is still better than anything i have seen out there . i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student
1	i got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the zip n hit as a training aid in addition to live batting practice . we would work it into our routine for pre-game drills and starting practice drills . with every player maybe getting another 20-25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre-game session , over a season it adds up to 200-300 extra swings that you ca n't get from live bp ( which takes too long , you must retrieve balls ) . both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0.400 in both bronco and pony . i had several players bat over 0.500 and 0.600 , too . it also helped them develop a level swing which improves the batting average , and become better situational hitters . other opposing teams also began copying us . perfect for pre-game warmups where you are n't allowed live bp , i.e . regular games , tournament games . our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment . the players can even help drill themselves .
0	i have had very bad experiences with this company in the past . there is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever . if there 's a problem in the first 90 days , you 're fine . after that , you 're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it . as all their components are manufactured in asia , they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time . be very careful with these people , as you 're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty , non-functioning bookend
1	this product does what it claims it will do . put in the time and effort - you 'll feel great ! of course , i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box . however , i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started . only doing it a few weeks , but enjoying it
0	i would n't recommend this table . some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken , and i 've only used this table on three camping trips . too bad , because most of my other coleman gear has held up really well
0	this is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really , really hate . this thing does not shuffle plus it will eat up your cards badly . do not buy this piece of garbage ... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so . if you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase , here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new card shuffler . 1 . pet dog 's chew toy 2 . door stop 3 . play street hockey 4 . stress release stomping toy 5 . mother-in-law birthday gift 6 . modern art for coffee table 7 . nerf ball target practice 8 . condom dispenser kind of think about it , this is a great toy . have fun ! ps . if you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at : excalibur professional 6 deck card shuffler ; you might like it .
0	this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo
0	i cant say anything for the other things , but the compass does not work at all . north is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same , north does does not . i was looking for a simple , compass keychain . this is small and a keychain , but a compass that works it is not .
0	even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product ( as described ) , i still would have returned the item . the mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it was n't really suitable for the intended purpose
0	ive never done a review before because i have never been so disgusted with a product . ive had mine a few weeks . used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far . well , just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging broke.. cracked right in half as i was turning it with my fingers . i didnt even put any weight into it ! ! last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground . i dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut . the design is terrible . rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what i did ) . tko just lost me . i will never buy anything from them again . seventy dollars for this chinese made garbage . im sure the welds will be the next thing to go . buyer bewar
1	this item garners the same complaint that i have with the aqua sphere pull buoy : it floats , is functional , but nicks/gouges very easily . i try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag ( snorkel , fins ) , but it still gets dented , nicked , scratched , and gouged . regardless , it works quite well and i really like the smooth underside , the ribbed handholds , and the ample crescent at the base ( perfect for kicking with my head down into the water ) . one of the best parts is that it is n't as small as a kid 's kickboard , but it 's not huge , either . really good product overall
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs
0	i live in northern california , so rain is nothing new to me . i 've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now , but since i signed up for free amazon prime , i figure i 'd buy everything i 've been wanting for 30 straight days . this umbrella made my list because i 've read some decent reviews on it , plus it 's affordable but i guess you get what you pay for . the first umbrella came and the tip was split . i ask for a replacement from amazon which arrived next day ( nice service ) however , i wish this umbrella is as good as amazon 's service , because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged . except this one is far worse ; the entire tip is missing . since this is the replacement , amazon will only do a refund . by the way i 'm still without an umbrella
0	it was flat after one night of sleeping . we had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning . also , be aware that you need an ac outlet to pump it up ... it 's not for camping
0	overall poor quality in craftsmanship . one can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place , and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed . the wood is of subpar quality as well . the price is low ; however , i would not recommend these swords
0	i would have given this product one star , but i did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic . after about two weeks of use , the electronic mini-stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment . as previous reviewers have noted , the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil/plastic/metal . after two months of use , the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid . good thing i had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it . i owned and used the electronic mini-stepper for all of four months , using it five days per week ( 20-25 minutes per day ) , before the cable secured around the pully-wheel snapped loose of its moorings . this probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective , leaking shocks . i now own a twenty pound , forty dollar door stop . there 's no reason , other than ultra-cheap construction , that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months . during this time , i used nothing but normal exercise practices : smooth , even , steady steps ... nothing jarring . buyer beware on this one
1	bought it for daughter 's christmas gift . she loves it . cool color . adjustable height is useful for her short height . she is very proud with it . bigger wheels gives a bit more stability
1	purchased for a christmas gift . the larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed . he had the orignial a scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction . he was also wanting the wheely `` kick '' bar over the back wheel . overall , the a3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying `` the razor . '' kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion . price on amazon could n't be beat . price was by far the best from a host of on line sites i checked . shipping was great deal and came quickly , within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before christmas ! in the word of my son `` santa be very very good to me !
1	this is n't a weight loss tool , it just helps to sweat off excess water retention . i have noticed a considerable difference using it with my daily workout !
1	i had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale . dumb idea ! as i get older , this stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise i need . good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes , i 've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist . i like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship , i did n't really expect to be amazed , but it is sturdy , if plain . the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display , but i think it will out last any cheap show sword
0	i purchased this bike rack because i was moving out of state and did n't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike . i also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails , parks , etc . so , i went with schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive . i drove from nc to fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea with this rack . i did n't have any trouble assembling the rack , only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go . however , during my trip , i had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back . the buckles do not hold the straps in place . this is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway ( or any busy road ) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic . also , even if the buckles hold , the wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame . i had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back ( and yes , the rack was assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack is probably a great value if do n't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it is a a complete waste .
0	this imported 'sword ' is actually a long dagger , about the size of a wwii-era bayonet . in the scabbard it is all of 15 inches . the construction , fitment of parts , finish , and overall quality is poor . definitely a mass-produced , low quality item . the blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge . it would properly be labeled a `` masonic-ish '' sword as the symbolism on the handle , guard , and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of masonry . there are prominent red crosses and a few knights templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement . the blade is sharply pointed so this is not something children should play with ! it looks okay hanging on the wall ( in the scabbard ) but that is about all it is good for . the price is not a bargain , it is about right for a chinese-made import of this size and quality . as long as you do n't expect more that what i have described , you might like this item
0	the important top hand bar is missing . the thing smells like gear grease . i ca n't tell if i like to use is , because it 's missing parts
1	i just wanted to comment on sarah 's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together . my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help . i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated . i took it in parts after reading it fully twice . after all the small parts : pole , height adjustment apparatus , rim / backboard , i carried it all outside and put it togehter . one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard . overall i got it done in parts , total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between . have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten .
0	we know strollers ! ! this is our 5th stroller over 4 kids . we decided to try a dually . pros : plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds . `` cute '' cons : we 're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller . in our opinion the added expense should n't equal just an extra seat , but better design and higher quality . 1 ) while the dimensions are listed in the description , the relative size to every day objects are not discussed . objects , like say , doors . this stroller wo n't fit through 90 % of the doors in the world . you basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on parking it in the garage next to your suburban . the doorway must be a 3'0 door ( 36 inches wide ) . that 's usually only your front door . forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller . 2 ) the straps are awful . again , our 4th stroller . worse one of all . incredibly , incredibly difficult to use . i 'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are . despite having tightened them up as tight as possible , the two year old was out in under 10 minutes ( once she decided to be out ) . 3 ) impossible to allow the children to sit up . again , adjusting the straps to the utmost , the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep . perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps ? 4 ) hand brake is setup for the left hand . appears to be reversible if you want to work on it . 5 ) hood can not be lowered to cover front of children . if say , you are walking into the sun ( morn or evening ) , the kids are completely exposed . conclusion : very frustrating buy . would n't recommend it at all
1	as a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools , i 've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels . while i 've managed to master that skill ( can shave hair off my arm with these tools ) , putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare . i 've tried numerous methods , none of which has worked well . about a year ago , i puchased the spyderco sharpening kit . read the manual , watched the dvd , put my kitchen knives to it , and ... ... ended up with pretty dull knives . frustrated , i put this kit in a kitchen drawer . fast-forward to last week . the kitchen knives are dull again , and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives . so , i pulled out the spyderco again and gave it another try . this time , i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife . after just a few strokes , it was good as new . so , i tried it on the straight knives again , but only got a modest increase in sharpness . now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel , i tried sharpening my swiss army knife . again , after a few stokes on the sharpmaker , i had a wicked sharp knife . i was down in the workshop today , sharping my plane blades and chisels . the last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane ... the blade on these is very convex , so sharping it is always a challenge . fortunately , it does not need to be super sharp , and never has been . the sharpmaker was sitting out , so i said `` what the heck '' , and gave the scrub plane 's blade a few freehand strokes on the sharpmaker ... no sharpening jig to hold the blade like i normally use . for fun , i tried to shave hair off my arms ... .and it worked ! i could n't believe it ... this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy ! it 's american-made , very well thought-out , and works amazingly well when your blades are n't made of junk steel . what more could you ask for ?
1	use the xl most every day and find that it does a fairly good job for what it is supposed to do . only use it about ten minents at a time since i am 72 i dont overdue it . can see the difference in my abdomen already
1	just the perfect cap ! . it fits like no other swimming cap . it wo n't pull you hair when removing it , neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning . very resistant material , and a great finish . awesome colors !
0	small ... very small kit , not as advertised . every item needs expensive batteries
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob
1	these are exactly what they are advertised to be . i thoroughly enjoy using them
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one . i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs ( the screwdriver heads , the small blade , the scissors ) , and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics , camping , or canoeing ( the saw blade , the large knife , the toothpick ) . there are still a few tools i have n't used , but overall , this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money
1	great flooring system . easy to assemble and very strong . expensive but worth it
1	this has been used by our family forever ! we use it on burns , diaper rashes , cuts on our animals , and just about any type of open wound -- it works wonders ! plus , this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag , purse , drawer , or first aide kit
1	extra clips are neccessary ! the gun goes through ammo and the clip only holds about 45 rds
1	a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it . he has had many occasions where his chain has broken , or his tires have punctured , so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides . the airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools , including inflator , tire levers , hex wrenches and chain tool ( all included in the airfix ) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces . i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools , but for handiness , this seems hard to beat . the blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive . so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 , in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern , pardon the pun , i imagine i have made a wise purchase
0	maybe the s120 will work for you , but it was nothing but trouble for me . i bought it because of the great features and price , but returned it because of all the problems : 1 ) the manual is anything but friendly , e.g . after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there 's a short cut . thanks . 2 ) after spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in , i 'm off to exercise . great start , the reading is my usual pulse around 55 , then it drops out to 0 . ok , maybe the contacts are too dry , so i wet them . off i go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0 . ok , maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly . different position , same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map . i decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise . final result -- i got periods of reasonable heart rates , but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190 . the next day i try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings . it went back later that day
0	the compass is wholly unreliable . the light button turns on in your bag , thus draining the battery . one of my worst amazon purchases
0	i bought this gloves so i would n't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime i went for a bag workout . one reviewer is clearly confused . they said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand . turns out there is no metal bar in it , but instead it was plastic or something similar . then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag i wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles . this has never happened to me before and i have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years . yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years . another thing i noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags . they get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them . gave these gloves 2 stars since i liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work . but they need to be greatly improved upon .
1	we got this for our son . he loves it ! ! ! ca n't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him . stylish and well built , i think it should last a long time . great product , would recomend to anyone ! !
1	this is a great exercise ball . it is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines . let me tell you ! ! ! it is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and i can really feel my muscles working out . it helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility . this is a great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i ordered a wobble balance board from everyting fitness and it came from karate depot and does n't even look like the product i ordered . i only give 1 star , because i ca n't give zero starts
1	i go to anime expos alot . and to to be honest this sword aint half bad . unlike its 67 ' brother its only 37 ' but its a whole lot better to wield . combat ready , very sturdy and made in china . i notice some swords made in pakistan ! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wan na save some cash
0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar . the old 724 had metal connectors . making them plastic is insane . these connectors will break over time . additionally , a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors .
0	i really wanted to like this lantern . it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price , but the light output is pathetic . the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it , but i find that doubtful . the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon . in fact , i think you could read a map , or a book , play cards , or follow a trail , more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights . i 'm returning mine .
0	billy is great , full of energy and enthusiam . i get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results from his workout . his customer service rep were helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i 've been doing business with amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders . i never , never once had any problems with my orders at amazon . when i had questions , it 's amazing at not only how quick amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation . because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response , it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible . i 've never found customer service of this very high and rare quality . in november of 2005 , after ordering the billy bands from the official billy bank 's website . i was sent a package , without my permission from the company that contained billy 's energy formula supplements . it was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85 . i was upset this was sent without me knowing but here 's the worse part . i contacted customer service , a gentleman told me do n't worry you have n't been billed just send us back the package and we 'll credit you $ 5 into your account for the shipping , packaging , and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back . within a few days i send the product i never requested back . twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep i was told i would receive a $ 5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days . i was already upset about this matter but it was n't that big of a concern . however , about 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received the $ 5 credit to my account . but there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $ 8.97 . a few days later the $ 8.97 was put back into my account . when i contacted the company this is their reply : thank you for your recent e-mail . we apologize for the inconvenience . our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent the item i never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit ) . this means that when the charges actually went through , you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice ( i kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated ) . you received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too . this means , when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97 . this is also the refund that you have received , the amount paid ( again since the item was sent back within 14 days i should n't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that i would only be charged a small portion ) . so basically they sent me a product i never requested . told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back . took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen . to sum it up , do business with amazon !
1	the item is nice , but $ 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous . i know that if you shipped two of them together , it would n't cost $ 15 for both of them , let alone separately . and everyone wonders why their items are so cheap..
0	i am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews ; i am quite diappointed . i purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy . however , it turned out not to be so . first of all , the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors , though i suppose that 's a personal issue . as for performance , this bike is not worth its stated price of over $ 200 , so do n't think you are getting some great deal . the suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny . i am not an expert on bikes , but i 'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this . also , after about a week , i noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as i peddled . it 's hard to explain ... almost like something is out of place . so again , the bike is not worth this price . perhaps if it were being sold for around $ 100 it would be a decent deal
0	not what i expected . this bench is ok for a petite woman , not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall ...
1	this is the first product i 've ever bought to work out my forearm , so i ca n't compare it to anything else ... but i will say it does work . i 've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it . it 's comfortable and easy to use . i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder , though
0	despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours , the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes . also during those lackluster minutes of operation , the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item ... they are n't actually anti-gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling , so in other words , you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar . they are in no way meant to make you float , or fly , or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..
0	when i purchased this item i got the impression that the kit ( looking at the picture ) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame . you should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit . i need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it . the title of this item should say : `` gazebo screen '' and not `` gazebo screen kit '' ... unhappy custome
1	yes ... ... ... i like it , after using for 2 weeks , my fingers were strong . good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body
0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it , so i thought i might like the alps chair too . i was wrong . it 's very light weight , but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs , which made it more difficult to carry and transport . the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings , one of which broke the first time i used the chair . the next day , three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points , throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless . save your money on this one
0	had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass . small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack , but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed . i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer . we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts
0	i ditto the previous reviewer ... i thought these seats were adjustable , was i wrong , there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down.. suck
1	my daughter is 2 1/2 years old , 32 lbs . and i wanted to get back into jogging . after reviewing many strollers i decided on this one for it 's price and features ( swivel front tire , rubber tires , tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs ) . i was n't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and has n't complained during any of my runs . it handles great too ! ! my only complaint is that i have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up . i have a suv so it has not been a problem , but i must say for me it does not fold flat at all and i am not sure it would fit into a trunk . but , most reviews have have said it folds easy . not sure what i am missing , but..
0	i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely can not afford to spend any more money . for around $ 60 , you could get the `` world industries m.a.d . balance board '' and get a much better looking and more durable product . or you could spend around $ 80 and get a bongo board . if you really want the best and have the money for it , you could spend about $ 120 and get an indo board . the zoomboard that i received was green and blue . unfortunately , it looks garish , but a child may like the look of this . in addition to the garish coloring scheme , the board has a rough sandy underside . this is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube . however , after a couple weeks of using it ( five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs . frame ) , the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down . then again , if you wait it out , the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you wo n't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube . but the gripping surface will be compromised . if you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting , the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before . make sure there are no grains , pebbles , or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube . this may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube . overall , this board is fun , but not great quality . if you absolutely can not afford $ 10 more to purchase a much better product , then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it . if you can afford more , keep looking and check out the products that i mentioned above and get something that 'll actually be worth your hard-earned money
1	the suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes , and worked , as advertised , paired with the suunto t3 , training effects/heart rate monitor . unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past , the suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the suunto t3 , even in bad weather and over rough terrain . although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the suunto t3 on the handle bars , this configuration is not required for use . the suunto t3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor , and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist , receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest
0	this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh . the poles are not super high quality and i would imagine are going to break is used a lot . i used this in some high winds and the zippers broke .
1	this product is phenomenal . it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly . it worked under my wetsuit . it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming . it works between your thighs or on your chest when running . it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running , but i ca n't directly confirm that . i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours
1	i feel this product provides excellent value for the occasional biker or hiker . while cycling i had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice . i also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area . there was still plenty of room for snacks , keys , clothes etc . i purchased a sony portable cd player/radio . it fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack . my radio also has a remote which is great when you do n't want to stop . the chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around . the one negative that would report is the bladder hook . rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack . i think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely . what i found is that when you take it off , it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking . i try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook . this seems to help . overall though i am very pleased with my purchase .
0	i paid [ ... ] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it works and after using it a few time si relized its flaws first its too damn small its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap and doenst do squat in heavy battles and the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
0	well , they looked so cool on tv that i ordered 2 of them and i regret it . it 's awkward to get the hook back into the `` rocket '' once the bait is on . i took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod . we left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current . i 've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money . if you 're going to take a little one out fishing , just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up . the only reason i gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat idea .

1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now , and this is by far , no doubt about it , the best thermos ever invented . i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny . after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day , at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot . if you need to keep liquids hot , this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
1	i write very few reviews , but i just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels . i have fought this battle many years , with no success . i started using this stuff 3 weeks ago , along with a heel sander , and i only have a small scar that i suspect will go away . i can not believe the results ! ! ! i only wish i had taken pictures to proof the results ! ! but who wants to look at ugly cracked heels ? ? ? lol ... it works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	bought this for my son . he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week . then the wheels broke . he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway . the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
1	expensive , but i use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga . very satisfied
1	great product . i just received my ball today . i could n't wait to work out . if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max-fitness
0	like you ( i 'm sure ) i saw this machine on television ( mistake number one ) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first . this machine is a joke . if you can not get your legs over your head then maybe this machine is for you . but this is not for serious users who stretch everyday . i can do more with my $ 5 stretch band from target than i can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk . the resistance is zero , and just laughable over all . save yourself the money , and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band !
0	i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift . at first he was thrilled to get a new one . upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it , he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain , making it almost impossible ( and very uncomfortable ) to use . he had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way . he did , however , like the other features , namely the light and the pen .
0	... and buy a gps instead . i agree with previous reviewer ( dave57 ) , i would never buy a suunto again . worst than dave , i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water , could n't even tell the time . i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and `` kindly '' offered a repair for 140 euros .
1	perfect , exactly what i expected and wanted . i ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up , had it on in less then 5 min . my bike is full suspension , 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe ( u ) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem . do n't know how it would handle a crash in trees though , sits high like a dirt bike look . people ask where i got it
0	very disappointed ... it didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze ... ..
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii . it is n't perfect . it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface , but it is n't enough to cause any problems . it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow . you probably wo n't find anything better
1	i just love my little parrot ! the kids on the bike trail love to hear it too
0	first of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doese n't match . what seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one . at the beggining everything was ok , at the end of first week the light button locked ( after a few hours i get it unlocked ) , in the second week the the battery has ended . i 'm very disappointed..
0	i bought this compass at a good price , thats about all i can say good for this product . the backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading , i have to keep resetting it . i can not reccommend product
1	very nice flooring for the price . easy to put together . i use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area i have set up in my garage . if you are looking for aerobic room flooring , i would recommend buying the 20mm version
0	i got this heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so i had to order a replacement strap when i went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week . so i had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch . i am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better . i was very disappointed with this my suunto dive computer is great this hrm sucks .
1	it is a great football but is hard to grip if you do n't have real large hands and is slippery
0	basically the title says it all . i figured for a 100 dollars i would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge . basically this is a poorly made toy that should n't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred . like i said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the tru-break putt 'n hazard . the only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet
1	i live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so i 'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat . everywhere i went the trailers were priced at $ 250 plus . i was a bit skeptical about buying this instep because it was a `` no name '' brand ( wrong - it turns out that its made by schwinn ) although it was priced at about half the price on others . when i research the product i found it to be lighter than the pricier brands . it runs smooth , easy to attach/detach . i keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that i my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she 's can continue sleeping . i recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter . it has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags , an additional bag in the front with my daughter , and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike . i 've also taken my daughter an another of her friends ( it sits two kids ) and they loved it . overall , a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter , and priced much below comparable products
1	let me start by saying that i ordered this rowing machine on april 2 and it arrived on april 5 ! i was so excited ! even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together , it is n't impossible . the tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions . also , two of the steps seem to be out of order , but i still give this product a 5 star rating . when i was in college , i used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it . this is just like it , but i think it 's even better . i do n't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like i did with the one at college . the quality is great for the value . i feel that i have enough resistance and that i 'm getting the workout that i 'm looking for . i use an elliptical rider first , then i get on my rower . this is now rounding out my workout and i love it ! my elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost . this rower is inexpensive , but does n't feel like a cheap machine . again , i am thrilled with it . by the way , i do n't think that you can tell it in the picture , but the fan cover has holes all the way around it . when i 'm working out i can feel the breeze that it is generating . it does n't blow me away , but it 's enough to cool me off some . i hope you find the machine you 're looking for . if you 're looking to save some money and get a great workout , this may be the rower for you .
1	i purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that i expected , it did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time . i wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall , i am very happy with my gym and i use it all the time . only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way i look
1	the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised . great folks to work with . now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily ... i 'd sure buy that too
0	i had purchased a rifle from airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use . the quality was not good , but , the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with . it has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped . i have had every excuse imaginable , first they wanted me to pay for shipping , then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun , then they said they did not have that model any longer and i would have to pay for the higher priced model . i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced . i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress . the worst customer service of all time !
1	i bought this bike for myself and i love it . i got it for half the listed price . it was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking ( at 30+yrs old ) but i 'm going to stick with it . the other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike . the brakes are excellent and the bike itself , including shocks , are just as sturdy as my husband 's expensive pro bike . the 24inch is perfect for me , being barely five-foot-two ; and does n't seem too juvenile in stature or in color . i highly recommend this bike
1	i did n't know what to expect , but these turned out to be very good quality . they stretch well and return to shape . they do n't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising . i was very pleased with the product . be careful , though , if you have a latex allergy . i also got excellent service from the company ! i would definitely do business with them again
1	this little device is easy to put together and easy to use . not for 'intensive ' workouts however , you can pretty much use it anyplace you 're sitting down . that could mean even while the tv is on ! like all exercise equipment , if you do n't use it you lose it
0	good points of the el-300 : powerful sharp beam ; long run per battery change ; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft ; and , it 's a superb flashlight . i like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs , so i often borrow it from my bike . this light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes , if the beam hits direct from even , say 40 away . cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people 's eyes . in my estimate , it is mostly a terrific flashlight , and not a great bike-mounted headlight , at least as a stand-alone . trouble is , that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials : lighting your path ( you actually can with this focused power ) ; or alerting others to your presence . that would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic , or a tad right or left , toward peripheral traffic , depending where you are , and how the road tracks , and where cars are coming from . it 's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers , which is great , if conditions are all just right : if you focus the lamp near level , and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam . however , traffic off to the side is another deal , since the headlight 's peripheral light suffers by contrast . i nearly took a short trip to a long rest , as a result . late on a quiet night , one flaky guy entering a major , broad secondary road i was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign , on a side street to my right , ahead of where i had just rounded a curve . he had a view accross broad lawns , on up the dark road behind me . after slowing just a bit , he accelerated and ran his stop sign . i was right near his position on his side-street , `` committed , '' pedaling about 15 - 17 mph , about to cross his bow . he started his right turn , gunning it , merging with unseen me . he was totally unaware of me , and was clearly of this mindset : `` no double-car-headlights , no car noise , so no car , so nuttin ' coming , so , good-to-go , so -- gun it ! '' ... all in the space of a couple seconds . moving fast , with the right-of-way , i had the el-300 blazing away bright . only , it was focused straight ahead of me , and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front . i was dependent on the el-300 , to send ahead to the likes of him , unavoidable announcing light . it 's what i paid for ( about $ 45.00 delivered ) . i also wore a white helmet , had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk , and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals . but i know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit , when not bathed by headlights , and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver 's eyes . that 's why i own a headlight . it 's why now-enlightened nj demands a bike headlight . of course , neither does a driver have any merit , when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read `` no need to stop as long as i do n't see anyone coming . '' he nearly killed me , coming fast at me , broadside . he had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn , still accelerating , when he spotted me and panic-braked . we were at one point about 2 feet apart , thanks to his hard braking , and my veering left on the ( luckily deserted ) dark main road . i was , for a fraction of a second , looking down at his headlights and bumper almost below me . could have reached over and touched his hood ornament . incredible experience . it was my closest call ever , and scared the hell out of me . it must 've scared the hell out of him , too . he registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast , as he scrambled around and passed me , racing off before i could read his plate . i guess it must 've ticked him off , my scaring him with that close call . one little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile . equally maddening for him , after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight , and the white helmet , and all the reflectors ( those alerted him , once i was his front-and-center target ) , he would had to then see that blazing headlight 's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror . damn , nuttin ' he could blame on this creep on the bike . : - [ the el-300 simply failed me that time , as i see it , by focusing most of its light in a narrow , long-projecting beam . it was focused left of where he was looking , when i was very close to the side street he was traveling , ignoring his stop-sign . there should , from so much light energy , be some part diverted wider , closer to the bike , even if lower intensity . in my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp : 1 . the narrow focused beam , making you `` live ( ? ? ) with '' the single direction in which you aim the beam . its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light . 2 . that is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on , both vertically and horizontally . the vertical part is the worse ; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight 's balance-point , so it 's a seesaw that 's forward-heavy . lift your bike front , tap it down lightly , and you 've likely refocused the lamp lower , as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point . aim it temporarily right ( and tight ) , and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump . it then drops a few degrees , and you keep correcting it vertically , to light either your intended path , or the oncoming drivers ' windshields . your need is like being at the oscars : you want to both see , and be seen , only in this case to save your life . i am chasing after another led lamp now , which i understand to have a wider ( along with brighter ) beam . i have respect for cateye in general . their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the el-300 .
1	as an intermediate player , i have been highly satisfied with this racquet
0	small print on box : charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the ac charger adapter , and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12v car adapter . the spotlight/lantern can not be used while charging . a full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power . 30 minutes after charging for 15 hours ? what the heck is the point of this flashlight
0	i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago ... thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me . it is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up . my old thighmaster is very sturdy-i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new . this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year . save your money
0	i never received the product and had a terrible experience with amazon trying to get my money back
0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work ( or weather ) complications . if you are like me that means weekdays late at night , or very early in the morning . i 'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes . my neighbors ca n't stand it . hey , i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner . to give you an idea , i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing . do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models .
1	with a job that is extremely sedentary , 3 days sitting all day at a desk , 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car , this has been a most welcome purchase . 5 to 10 minutes on this each day , has greatly relieved my low back discomfort to the point where i 'm able to continue this heavy work schedule , in relative comfort . if compressed discs are your problem , you 've got to try this , after first checking with your physician
0	mirrors are too small and too distorted . the picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if ! ! it 's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them
0	i bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college . so i wanted to get a few small workout machines for home . the day i got it , one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already . the machine is designed very poorly , although what can you expect for the price . i 've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week , and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half , leaveing that resistance level useless : - ( . overall though , i have to say , i really love this thing . if it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time , it would be a great peice of equipment . if you use it carefully and correctly , you may be able to avoid these problems though . i give it a two because i love the machine , but i hate its bad habits ...
1	i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy . i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx-just the right size . the box was easy to assemble - less than an hour . it is also easy to attach to the vehicle . the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx . i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well . the box is sturdy after assembling i
0	i 've been looking for weight lifting gloves , and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped . these gloves , however , dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers . they also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs . weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases . these gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases . if you want a good pair of gloves do not get these
0	i thought this was great at first until i realized that it works sporadically . i can get up in the morning and walk all over the house , look down and check my sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps . other times i can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps . one of the problems with it is its shape . unlike some pedometers ( like omron ) that are a vertical oval-shape , the sportline is a horizontal rectangle , which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt . it 's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately . after much frustration , i finally bought an omron pedometer which i love . unfortunately , this sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless .
0	let me first say that i did not purchase this mini stepper through amazon , but rather directly from the discovery channel store . two weeks after i submitted my review of their product on their web site , however , they still have not seen fit to post it . i used the discovery electronic mini stepper daily for 29 days ( 30 minutes per day ) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke . this seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment , judging by previous reviews on the dcs ( discover channel store ) web site . being inside the 30 day return window , i sent my stepper back for a refund . customer service , i must say , was excellent ... only the product itself was cheap and substandard . on a related note , this is the third mini stepper ( various brands , not all dcs ) i have owned in the past year . they have all broken down in one way or another . feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details , but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper . take some advice from me when i say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness . that is to say , if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes , then you may be satisfied with one . however , if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine , then do n't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it , trust me . there 's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking , pulley cables breaking , shocks leaking ... and i actually broke the frame of one stepper . through all of this , i have learned one important lesson about exercise : keep it simple . i am now having great success with some simple resistance bands ( many varieties are available here at amazon ) and cardiovascular exercises ( e.g . regular old jumping-jacks ) . i get a better workout than any i ever got from a mini stepper , and i 'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places : - ) honestly , if you want to save yourself some grief , please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction . just buy yourself some resistance bands , maybe a jump rope , an exercise mat , an instructional video/book , and then get to work . exercising to tone your body and lose weight is n't easy ( and if it is , then you 're probably not doing it right ) , but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
1	i have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym . my size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car . i am not sure if someone with a large shoe size ... say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes ( basketball shoes ) may find the bag a tight squeeze . overall very satisfied
1	very well made product ; easy assembly and mounting . the no wobble feature is excellent . highly recommend this product
0	i bought this for my four year old for christmas . the net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper . a week later , his friend , also four , broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set . do n't waste your money . even for little kids it 's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last .
0	this is the biggest joke on the planet . no doubt , it is scary , but c'mon people . i guess it 's to scare the sh*t out of you . my comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item . think about it . . . the toilet . one of the best places for germs . and you want to attach some rubber device to it . i 'll do you one better , and you 'll get just as good a laugh from it . ( also , it 'll be a lot cheaper ) go buy a roll of saran-wrap . cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl . wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it . i do n't think no one will die from this type of trick
1	these keep your feet warm . not 6 hours but three . still a great help keeping feet from feeling cold
0	i wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country . this retro designed , one speed , steel framed , coaster braked , comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice . when it arrived , i pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it . the first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are not included in the manual ( which seems to cover every bike but this one ) . how hard could it be to write up instructions ( with tool specifications ) for each model they manufacture ? a one page flyer could have done the trick . to further complicate matters , some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes . it turned out that i could n't complete the assembly , because i could n't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment . i had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly . even the bike shop had problems with this bike , because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires . i watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand , so that it would n't rub the tire . when i got the bike home , the first thing that i did was to adjust the seat to the correct height , and take it out for a ride . within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down . the quick release handle ca n't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it ( i 'm not that heavy ) . chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this , and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height . rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it ... i will check to see if i can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height . its too bad they could n't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment ! the points i do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame , and tires that will work well for unpaved trails ... when i can finally ride this .
0	do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch . this monitor is sold as `` providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout '' . since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout reebok did to substantiate this claim . get a strapped monitor for working out . while this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose
1	i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy
0	i received a phone msg . from the vendor two days after i ordered this item from amazon . a day after i received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address , and if i had another address outside california to ship it to . i thought it was strange since i only have one address . i was looking forward to geting this item too..
0	i was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good . when it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy 's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people . i kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch . the pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox

1	my grandson loved this beginners set of 500-plus cards . and what a price . about a penny apiece .
1	this was a gamble since it is n't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an nfl athelete during an espn interview . i started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily . two months later my strength has increased , my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished . my workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on mm but the results since using mm have made an impact , there is nothing else i can attribute it to . the fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . do not fool yourself , it is loaded with fat . it relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it 's true benefit . you will not get sculpted by using mm without commitment , you will only get fatter . but if you are committed and use mm as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance .
0	i was promised 1-2 day shipping and did n't get it . i was promised reciept by dec. 6th and have n't gotten it
0	i just came accross this ad , and thought to say something about the price of this item . please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price .
0	this product does not work . the vendor is great though . they refunded our money very quickly . we were very disappointed because it is a great idea .
1	i 've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly , went together fairly easy , and best of all its quiet ! something i seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when i can actually hear the television over the machine . the complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate . the bike i received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box ( arrived when i was at work or i 'd have sent it back ) . when i called for service i was greeted promptly , promised a replacement cover , and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they 'd bet more like 3-5 . they even suggested that i consider where i was in the setup before i assembled the bike and whether or not i 'd want to take it apart to put the new part in . very positive experience ... now if i could just get myself to spend more time on it
0	this airbed leaked slowly from day one . i sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one . i do not recommend this product .
0	this stand is very bad quality . not worth investing in this stand . the speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood . it vibrates too much ! the swivel it comes with is made out of plastic ! it sucks ! invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co
0	well , i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking . first it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto , then it just stopped working . it was pretty cool for a bit , and is pretty light and easy to set up , but i 'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol
1	i bought one of these , based from a review . i pretty much agree with her , the machine is great and it gives a good workout . but she forgot to mention , the thing can cause your feet to get sore ! i tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt . i received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on , and that has solved the problem ! so far , i have not used the pistons , so it 's just a cardio workout . i have tony 's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd 's , and i do get a very good workout ! i have lost 13 pounds so far by using it , and i noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
1	this is the best , jansport has always made an outstanding product . this is the third one i have owned . plenty of room and just right size
0	this is my third heart rate monitor . i purchased this one because the battery died in my last hr watch . i thought i could replace the battery , but when i tried to replace it , i broke it . oh well . . . anyway , i purchased the reebok fitness hr watch because it was on sale ( 50 % off retail ) . i could n't find any reviews on it so i `` rolled the dice . '' with my two previous hr watches , it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions . with the reebok hr watch , i had to read the instructions a couple of times . after a couple of training sessions , i began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings . there are a few pros on the reebok hr watch : ( 1 ) the chest heart rate strap will work with precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors . ( 2 ) the chest heart rate strap 's battery is easily replaced . ( i do n't know about the watch . ) ( 3 ) it has a lot of features that you 'll find in higher priced hr watches . now , the cons : ( 1 ) the heart rate reading is much too small if you 're near-sighted or need reading glasses . ( 2 ) the shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it 's difficult to read the small heart rate reading . in conclusion , because the heart rate reading is too small and there 's a glare , i ca n't read the watch unless i slow down , steady my arm , and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare . because of this , i 'm disappointed with this watch . if you 've got good eyesight , you can add 1-star
0	this gun is horrible . i bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $ $ $ . first off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light , if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless . when we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless , even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370 . also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber , then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun . after about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so i thought it was going to be decent , but i was wrong . spend your money elsewhere ! ! ! ! !

0	**********update - the old review ( see below ) was for dixiekip . the only reason it 's still two stars is because i ca n't figure out how to change it . old vegas chips has been nothing but helpful in this matter even though i did n't actually order the cards from them . i would order from them any day of the week now just based on their customer service in an issue that was n't even theirs . my apologies to old vegas chips in this matter . i highly recommend them and if anyone knows how to change the stars , please let me know . if you are interested in these cards , go with old vegas chips , not some other dealer ! ! ! ! - jim ****************** i ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion , they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered . i immediately ordered them , yet when my package arrived yesterday ( in a timely manner , i will give them that ) i opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face . i have not yet contacted the seller to see what options i have , but this is going to leave me either two options , 1 ) return them and wait longer for them or 2 ) suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards . i will repost once i have spoken to them
1	first off , those of you calling it a `` clip '' should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself . please call it a magazine ( actual name for it ) and a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round . second , dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument . you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun . this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away . its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar . it 's plastic , it shoots things . i 'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . so yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you . not a sport . i also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water . have fun . p.s . though they may noth have the trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb 's . if you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $ 30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps ( shoots like 300-350
0	my first pedometer from sportline worked only a few days ( digital display completely disappeared ) , so i returned it to them , and after over two months and several emails from me to them , they replaced it with this sportline 350 . the first two days , it worked fine , although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have . the third day , in the middle of the day it said approx . 3400 steps , later that afternoon it said 1300 steps , and by nighttime the display totally disappeared , and never came back . i just sent the second one back , and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service . their products seem to be very poorly made , and i do n't expect to purchase any more ... . after reading the reviews , i have just purchased an omron , and am hoping it will be much more reliable
1	one thing i really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use . it holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride . it feels good on your back too . it helps in this florida heat . cons : the mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle . it would be easier to have a t mouth piece . i will be looking for a replacement .
1	we have used more expensive `` professional '' grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the integrity compares for a home version . assembly and operation are easy , the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable , allowing conversation or tv viewing with only moderate volume increases
0	initially , the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate . it did , however , give my wife a good laugh ; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps ' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote . but after one week of use , the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick . pass on this one
1	this has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system ( and without having to learn another techno-gadget ) . my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter . i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision , but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night .
0	it holds my bike but seems unstable - i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car , and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards . plus , probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack ( user must tie the bike down every time ) . my bike has n't fallen off though..
0	my daughter is 38 '' and about 30lbs . it 's the perfect size for her . we mainly use it as something to lay on while watching tv or reading books on the floor . pros - when in the `` chair position '' , it 's tall enough to accommodate taller children . - cover is removeable and washable - comes with handy pink storage bag ( although it 's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed ) - pretty easy to convert into chair ( there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be `` connected '' in order to change it into chair - they are color coded ) . might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it . - inside of sleep bag is made of soft material ( although it appears as though it may snag easily ) . - large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag . easy for small hands to use . - weight limit : 100 lbs cons - the pump is very cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed ( it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands ) . - the air slowly leaks out of the bed . we actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased , so we exchanged for another one . but this one too deflates pretty quickly . example : if we completely inflate at 7pm , by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40 % of it 's air . - adult help is needed to change into chair . - adult help is needed to inflate . overall : it 's a bit pricey for the quality i was expecting . it would be nice if adult assistance was n't needed to change from bed to chair and back . defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night , but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so
1	i purchased this bench about a year ago . i received it in 4 business days which i thought was really good . it took me about 45 minutes to put it together , there is alot of nuts and bolts , but once i finished assembly it has been a good machine , and i am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week , it offers alot of different exercises , what i really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $ 300- $ 400.00 dollar range , which i was not willing to spend that much at the time . for the price of 129 bucks and the options you get , just can beat it . i am very happy with this machine . this machine is made by impex fitness and i definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when im ready . chris- v
0	ninety dollars for this is unbelievable . for less than $ 15 ( that is less than one sixth the advertised price ) someone with no skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less . it may not be `` cool '' , but it 'll get the job done . are you more interested in getting fit or having cool , trendy , and frivolous toys ? avoid this plastic albatross . it will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years . go to your local hardware store , spend half an hour and $ 20 ( and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit ) and get what you need without supporting this craziness ... or -- just go for a walk for free . save your hard-earned money

0	i bought this toy for my 9 month old son for christmas . he loved it and it is a wonderful toy . however , in mid january it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit . i replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still would n't work . i tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing . i had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon . they responded quickly and it appears that i will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that i may take my chances and buy it again . there are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine
1	we bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old . he would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time , which bought me time to do housework around him , etc . you can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there 's always variety . i 'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl . i bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $ 35 i spent . i would n't spend much more than that .
1	this is a nice sword for $ 35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed the sheath , there was some sort of goo on the blade ( probaby so it would n't rust ) . this is a carbon blade , so do n't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years ( by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune ) . just dont get the blade wet , ok. you can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you 're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade . i think this is shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine . blue dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought . i think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2 . i do n't want to bore you with video games , so i 'll get to the point . put it on display , dont cut your lawn with it , dont play ninja with it , and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it ( prefrebly a tin can ) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) in the face . please do n't throw the blade at your neibor either . p.s . i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you ca n't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you 're not smarter than a 5th grader .
0	the plug that keeps the air in kept popping out . we took it back and bought another one . same problem . so we took it back again . i think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float . buy one of better quality
0	i purchased the ab lounge 2 online , but returned it the same day . it 's too bulky heavy . i wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news , but it 's too heavy to move around , and it does not fold . i put it together in my living room , and then tried to get it into my bedroom but it would n't fit through the door . i had to un-screw the bars , fold pull it through the door . if i had put the ab lounge 2 downstairs , then i would never use it . unless you want the `` ab lounge 2 '' to be a `` permanent '' fixture in your bedroom or living room , then i would order something else . i need this thing to be where i can easily use it then put it away ... ... .the ab lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that . unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture , then do n't buy it . i 'm buying the `` ultra '' ab lounge because it folds for easy storage ... .it 's more expensive , but to me it 's worth the convenience of having the `` easy '' storage capability . i do n't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it 's not in use .
0	unfortunately , i purchased this product . thermometer and compass are not at all working . thermometer always shows 65 f and compass allways shows err . i highly recommend not to buy this on
1	i ordered these for my husband for christmas and he loves them , he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym . very durable and only moderately padded , great for the price
0	this was given to me as a gift . i used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.it never even worked that well to begin with . i e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty . they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come . they gave no apologies , they could not have cared less . eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame
1	a great multifunctional stove with lots of room . extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind , dust , and other campground debris out of your food . propane is the only way to go when you 're cooking in the wild woods were doing some backwoods camping . while the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along . a must-have for any camping trip
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far , it is built well and the price was awesome .
1	this mat is great . my advice for all you yogis that ca n't keep your hands from reenacting starsky and hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative . you have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new ( expensive ) mat in the back corner of your closet . first , i recommend that you buy an organic degreaser . give your mat a couple of sprays ( not too much ) , give it a scrub with a brush , hose it off , and hang it out to dry . this should help . option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda . do n't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes . i put my mat in the washer and have n't had any problems , but i 'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse that . with that , and a little bit of wear and tear , you should end up with a solid mat .
0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months . the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now . this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program -- upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus . the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus . ovewrall i can not recommend this product .
1	we have a slightly sloped yard so i was hesitant about getting a trampoline . we tried it , and it works fine ! my kids love it ! of course , like any other toy , they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months . i was also concerned at first about them falling off of it . i almost bought the enclosure to go with it but i decided to wait and see how high they jumped , etc . this trampoline is so small , they really ca n't get a lot of `` air '' so they do n't do flips and other dangerous tricks . it 's also very low to the ground . i am glad now that i did n't get the enclosure . we do n't really need it . i would recommend this trampoline for younger kids . the weight limit is 120 lbs so it ca n't support larger kids . also , since it is so small , we only let our two preschoolers jump together . when we have guests over , it 's one at a time . i love it that my kids want to be outside so much . this is better money spent than on video games , in my opinion
1	my second pair . knew exactly what i wanted . small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly . great deal
1	i 've worked out with cathe for about 6 months now , and i have to say , this is one of my favorite workouts . it combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout . the cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump , do power 15 's , fast feet shuffles , spike lunges , etc . lower body work - well , let 's just say , i hope you like to do leg press- since you 'll be doing it - a lot . there are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg . also , cathe inserts some static lunges and squats , among other moves . she does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn , there ! arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work , such as tricep dips off the high step , push ups , bicep curls , overhead extension , etc . overall , if you 're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles , this is the workout for you . beginners , beware- you can modify certain exercises ( i use dumbbells instead of a barbell ) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 ( 32 now ) . the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled . i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out . overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town . i 'm not a trail seeker , so have never tried it off road . very happy with the quality and ease of assembly
1	i recently got into gymnastics so i started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves . i 'm 5'6 '' and 180lbs and the xl fits me great . it has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and i do n't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up . it 's cut low enough so that i 'm not getting wedgies and i can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked . it 's not flashy so i do n't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body . it 's nice and plain , gets the job done and i 'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes
1	excellent product do n't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
0	the brunton nexus star is a low-cost , fairly rugged , basic compass . like any low-cost compass , if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go , but it lacks features you may later wish you had . on the plus side , it is lightweight , inexpensive , and fairly thin , so it does n't take up a lot of room in your pocket . on the minus side , the baseplate is very short , so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing . the biggest disadvantage , in my opinion , is that it does n't have a true declination adjustment ; it is advertised as having a `` declination scale '' which is not the same . on a baseplate compass , you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the north reference indicator ( sometimes called the `` doghouse '' ) etched on the bottom of the vial . compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this `` doghouse '' to align it with the desired declination . that way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the doghouse . on the nexus star , however , you ca n't do this . instead , you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination . in this case , the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse , and i find it can lead to errors , especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike . if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings , this is n't a problem . i can recommend this compass for use with a gps receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings , and it is suitable as a back-up compass . i also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my gps classes how to use a compass , but i would n't recommend it for serious work
1	this - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time ! i thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old , but he persisted and is getting better at it . the point is , it 's so fun he keeps trying ! the 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too . there seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way . only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
0	i went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers . i really did n't know which one to buy so i bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so i thought it was better somehow . even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging , it does n't actually display it . it only uses it to calculate the distance that you 've walked . i was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked . i got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket . i 'm just going to buy another pedometer . one that displays the steps walked and has a cover
1	just like the ones used in college intra-murals , excellent stitching and look to be very durable . fast shipping , and great deal
1	i thought the dvd was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising . it shows great technique and form . i used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of iowa so over the years i learned many of these pushup and workout techniques . pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape . i found myself to be too advanced for the power 10 workout so the video seemed like common knowledge . so for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great dvd focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent dvd . the dvd takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup . it then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion . with the dvd purchase i was hoping to find an exercise program , approximately 30-45 minutes long , that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time . i was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the perfect pushup into a nice timed workout . a workout that works my chest , back , arms , abs , and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time . something similar to a tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos . the power 10 workout is n't that type of video . it is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own . i recently wrote some emails to the body rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast , effective workout routine that one could get at the gym , but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their perfect pushup . he seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully bodyrev builds on this dvd like they have for their other products .
1	i mainly get stuff like this because i like the looks , not that i actually use the merchandise that much . the knife seems sturdy and strong . the nylon sheath is high quality .
0	i bought a gustbuster umbrella several months ago , expecting that it 'd be the last umbrella i ever needed . wow , was that a bad decision . this `` windproof '' umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind ( the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour ) . so i e-mailed the company because i remembered that it had a `` lifetime guarantee . '' they told me that i 'd have to ship it back to them ( which is perfectly fine ) , but i 'd also have to pay them $ 10 for their trouble . what kind of lifetime guarantee is that ? for $ 10 or less i could buy another umbrella locally . their product has proven that it 's not superior and it does n't live up to the claims they make for it . do n't spend all this extra money on a gustbuster because you think it 'll work better . it wo n't . go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a gustbuster -- you 'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella , and you wo n't be paying an outrageous price for something that does n't work the way their marketing claims
0	i had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months ! i live on a sailboat and i used it every day ; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience . the burner did not simmer well ( the flame kept creeping back up ) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died . it seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly . i called century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be . hmmmm . i did not think it would last long but i liked it so much that when it died i tried out another one . this one was immediately defective and i took it back . neither century nor coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more . camp chef may be a better , though much more expensive , choice for a person who does a lot of camping
0	i ordered and received this item through the golf warehouse . it arrived and i immediately saw a defect , in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly , even with major force . i contacted the golf wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them . i requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me . since then i have tried to contact david leadbetter 's organization but without any success . i am desperately unhappy about this purchase and , in particular , the after sales service . derek price toronto , o
1	i got this bike and i instantly liked it . the only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base . i tried many times to tighten it up but does n't help . well , other than that its a wonderful bike , zip noise and would burn a lot of calories ... ... ...
0	this tiny item ships for $ 2 more than it costs . i 'll purchase it elsewhere
1	loved this mat ! great for taller yogis . great tickness too ... a bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears off i totally recommend it !
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order . tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail . refused package a month ago . exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them , since amazon takes no responsibility . vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order . amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you 're stuck with erroneous charges . beware ! !

0	i have been using a polar s610 for some time . when everything is working it is a wonderful device . however , it is difficult to keep it running smoothly . for example , when i upgrade to a new computer i go through hell getting the software to work again . polar customer service is useless . most recently i have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my pc via usb for months . i do not believe i will be able cure the problem without purchasing new software + the software dose not include the usb connection software . that is sold seperately . polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on cd . the rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online . bottom line - the product is pretty good . however in terms of user friendly polar is a total failure . sorry folks - why not get a garmin 305 - i a
1	i looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my life gear and have no regrets in buying it . i am 6'2 '' and weigh 220 lbs . and it performs beautifully for me . it is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on . it was easy to assemble and took only a short time before i was using it . i have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too . i no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders . i would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back
1	this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet ( one shot ) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever ! !
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed . there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box . the product was scratched and parts were broken . fortunately the bench works , but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage . the product seems to be of quality , it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap
0	the handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous . also , the base metal footboard is cracking . i would n't spend the money on this scooter . it 's not worth it . spend your money on a cheaper model razor .
1	it 's more expensive than some , but it 's well-made , works perfectly , and will last for years . not requiring removal of the top to pour is great . just buy it already
1	the two most respected bodybuilding supplements are ( 1 ) whey protein and ( 2 ) creatine . they are also considered natural products or food products . while whey is without a doubt extremely useful , creatine does not help everybody . i have used creatine monohydrate in the past and i found it to be useless . it was so utterly ineffective that i just felt robbed of my hard earned money . my tub still sits in the cupboard . i have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are . i heard about no-xplode from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years . i researched it and it appears that bsn has formulated a surging `` creatine + nitric oxide '' drink that seems to work with most people . not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts . although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry ( see below ) and possibly some debatable compounds ( guanidino propionic acid [ gpa ] and glycocamine ) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results . 40 minutes after taking this stuff i can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat ( maybe even more ) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power . no fatigue . the surge is exactly as it promises . you will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body . it sets in at about 20 minutes for me . i feel a little woozy at first , disorientated , then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic . put it into action and you will see results . it also boats a cem3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does . i never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion no-xplode is standing on the fence saying i am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects . so far this stuff is getting very good feedback . yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients , but if you are looking for the creatine edge , even if creatine has never worked for you before , then no-xplode is probably the one . it can also help build muscle , but even if it does n't for you , it is still worth it for the surge . i am very glad that i got it . very . serving size : 1 scoop ( 20.5g ) servings per container : 40 amount per serving : calories : 36 -calories from fat : 0 total fat : 0g -saturated fat : 0g cholesterol : 0mg sodium : 150mg potassium : 75mg total carbohydrates : 9g -sugars : 0g protein : 0g vitamin b6 : 25mg - ( pyridoxine hcl ) vitamin b12 : 120mcg - ( cyanocobalamine ) folic acid : 400mcg magnesium : 360mg phosphorus : 500mg calcium : 75mg no-xplode proprietary blend : 20,500mg ( no-xplode contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system ) no meta-fusion ( patent pending ) ( l-arginine akg , citral-m ( citrulline malate ) , l-citrulline akg , l-histidine akg , rc-nos ( rutacarpine 95 % ) , gynostemma pentaphyllum ( 95 % gypenosides ) , nad ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) muscle volumizing creatine matrix ( patent pending ) cem3 ( creatine ethyl ester malate ) , 2cm ( dicreatine malate ) , betapure ( trimethylglycine ) , glycovol ( glycocyamine ) , guanipro ( guanidino proplonic acid ) , cinnulin pf ( aqueous cinnamon extract ) , keto-isocaproate potassium ener-tropic xplosion ( patent pending ) l-tyrosine , taurine , endurlac ( glucuronolactone ) , l-tyrosine akg , methylxanthines ( caffeine ) , mct 's ( medium chain triglycerides ) , vinpocetine 99 % , vincamine 99 % , vinburnine 99 % phospho-electrolyte replacer calcium phosphate , magnesium oxide , potassium phosphate , sodium phosphate glycerol hydrating polymers potassium glycerophosphate , magnesium glycerophosphate , glycerola stearat
0	... intentional rip off ? there is no 50 minute work out dvd included . the pump included does not work ( after pumping air for 20 minutes straight does n't even put a dent on the deflated ball ) and becomes very hot after a while . i kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates ( if ever ) . the `` 65cm '' ball turns out to be only `` 55cm . '' i do n't know ... seems like a rip off to me , but amazon is not at fault , since the nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item . quality-wise , the tko cory everson fitness ball 55cm i got a while back was so much better . the plastic is n't so sticky , and it felt a lot more durable than the nautlius one , too
1	these straps work great . they are nice and thick and seem to be made well . they 're easy to put on and they stay out of the way when you are n't using them . valeo made a nice strap
0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company . i just received my `` weslo cadence c44 treadmill '' and have attempted to assemble it . the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console . the customer service numbers are all disconnected . their website gives an additional number to call , and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers , or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you . i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them . this company is a complete scam . if you are even considering buying one of their products , your money is better spent getting your head checked
1	i bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an excellent addition to my home gym equipment . i 'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day . i also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks . this workout solution is about as low tech as it can get . i agree with the previous reviews below -- you could almost make this one yourself . it consists of a strip of mesh webbing -- like seatbelt material ; two adjustable , quick locking clips ; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes ; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the jungle gym into place when the door is shut . the equipment is simple , but sets up in seconds . the clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure . it 's so simple -- but it really works . the emphasis of the instruction sheet and the dvd that came along with it , is in upper body strength . you can do chin ups -- by regulating height , you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight . for me , this was the best part of the jungle gym . my chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device . body rows , push ups , and fly push ups are also possible . using the jungle gym , pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion ( like an atlas pushup ) and given the instability of the webbing , you also get more of a core workout . you can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats . you can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball . you can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor . some exercises ( full body rows and dips ) are difficult when attached to a door and lifeline suggests draping the jungle gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout . i have not yet tried using this over a tree limb ... however , i was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy . this is not a full fitness solution . but when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands , it really makes the home gym complete . i have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable , but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house . the jungle gym has worked . given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty , it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/chin ups over a short period of time . the downside of the device is that it requires a sturdy door and door frame . i would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely and lock or if you are worried about the integrity of your house 's construction . remember , the jungle gym is strong enough to hold your body weight , but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same . if not , you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do . remember too , that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door , the weight decreases as you pull . this is not a defect of the device , it 's just the physics of the situation . ( with free weights , the weight is stable throughout your range of motion . with exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens . ) also , this is a great device for weight/circuit training , but is not really an aerobic solution . the jungle gym , along with a few exercise bands are ideal for travel . i used mine with three lifeline exercise bands ( 2 r6s and 1 r8 ) , exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles . this yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds , fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises
0	we have in the past owned an in step single jogger . it was n't perfect but it certainly met our needs . it always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside . if we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it . after being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling . we purchased the in step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs . the problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller . my husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break ... it does n't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down . it took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger . after that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride . when placing them in we encountered our next problem ... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined . they wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other . as for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle . so off we set on our test drive . it was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn . after a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger . the only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position , criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell `` stay down kids ... if you sit up one more time i 'm going to sit in it and make you push me ! '' well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart . i do n't recommend this item . in all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon does the job more effectivel
0	field in a bag claims to be `` the perfect way to get a baseball game going '' . while this may be true , the number of games you can actually play with this set will be one ( if the set even makes it through the game ) . first off , with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground . with one of my sets ( i bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation ) , the wooden mallet was n't even glued together , it had fallen apart so i had to just use the head . then when i put the stakes into the ground , out of the 3 sets i had , at least 1 in each set broke while i was placing them . to actually place the bases , the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field . this was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when i went to second base realized the string was not long enough . granted , one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base ; however , it definintely is not the right length . after placing the bases the team is now ready to play . however , do n't wear cleats with these bases . the bottom of the base says , not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right ! with our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats ( and not all the kids had cleats ) tore them to shreds . our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out . it was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour . this non-profit wo n't see that money again : ) so unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up , do not plan on wearing cleats , and not playing a true game of baseball/softball ... .you would probably be better off buying the $ 8 flat bases for temporary use ( and they can be left outside afterward too ) . - just not impressed , sorr
0	do not buy this gun from hot import toys . that is my main point . it took a very long time to get to me ( 8 days ) and when it did , it was broken . not that it was shattered or it was jammed . it just did n't work . the piston seemed to be fine , the motor seemed to be connected , the gearbox seemed to be in tact , the batter ( although a little hard to install ) was charged , and the trigger was connected to the gear box . i thought that i could return it for either a working gun or just a refund . no . i e-mailed hit over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks . nothing ! i got no response , no notification , nothing . i continued e-mailing them because they did n't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site ! hit is the worst company to buy from ever ! from what i see and know , this gun seems to be quite the mpeg ! i would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately , i bet you anyhting that hit will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back : telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they are n't allowed to exchange my product . buy from airsplat ! ! ! trust me . this is a good gun . fast , accurate , good looking . do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive , having to find its broke , waiting for them to e-mail you back , and then have to live with a broken , useless piece of potential airsoft gun . so trust me , do n't buy from hot import toys
0	if you expect this to play music by itself , you will be dissapointed . basically , each foot is a sqeeze horn . it 's not bad a plush but as a musical toy , it 's horrible
1	this is a better stroller than the other three ( all for one child ) strollers we have . very maneuverable and adjustable . it turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently . folds down very quickly . it 's great that the kids can sit next to each other .
1	this inflatable kayak is a hoot ! i bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the truckee river through reno in it with my teenage son . ( yes , i am incredibly stiff and sore , and he 's raring to go again . ) first of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak . close , but not quite . it is just a pointy rubber raft , after all . it likes to go down the river sideways or backwards , depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits . but , it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing . about thirty years ago i used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western usa . i 've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers . i kinda know how to handle a kayak . this sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4 , depending upon the skill of the paddler . it rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes . it might be fun to play with solo in standing waves , but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests . there is no way to stay in it in a rollover . you 'll just get dumped out . on the practical side , it only weighs about 23 pounds , can be had for around $ 140 , inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump ( sold separately ) , is easily portaged around the rough water , has a very shallow draft , is made from some very tough pvc , is comfortable to sit in for several hours , is easy to dump water out of , cleans off quickly with just a hose , and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase . for us , it is perfect - affordable , handy in the waters we frequent , easy to inflate/deflate/store . i 'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own , and so that i wo n't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling . he can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts . sue : )
0	at first they kept the water out of my eyes and were comfortable . but after 3 or 4 times they had some water leakage . i use them for recreational swimming at the ymca . but am already looking for another swim goggle . i hope you post this even though i gave them a poor rating . thank you , eileen
1	this is a pretty good quality pack for the money . it looks good and feels well built . the height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it . it uses velcro panels to hold itself in place ( plus a locking strap to secure it once it 's adjusted ) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down . it was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip . my only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day , which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent . fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and i was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack . so you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range .
1	my husband and i finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit . : ) it only took us an hour and a half to assemble , and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process . after we finished the assembly , we both took a turn on a preset program . the machine is extremely sturdy , quiet , and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym . we 're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
0	this is not the same model i bought but it looks like it 's built the same way . i bought the inmotion trampoline by stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use . it did n't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off . when i called for warrantey information , i had waited too long , it is only guaranteed for 90 days . i 'd give it negative stars , but i have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up
0	i previously owned and used the 5 mi . version to communicate with my wife while i am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids . from the bus stop the 5 mi . unit was iffy . i purchased the 16 mi . units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop . it was worse . we received no signal whatsoever , not a peep . do n't buy this unit . save your money and buy the 5 mi unit
1	just a really great sports toy for kids . my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it , but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself . i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun .
1	this has to be one the best protein supplements in the market ! and more importantly , the taste is just unbelievable ! the banana creme and vanilla flavors are the best . from a `` supplement facts '' perspective , each rtd bottle is packed with 32 , yeah 32g of protein , and only 14g of carbohydrates ! the total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side , again 6g of which are in the form of mct ( medium chain triglycerides ) that are typically burned as energy and are n't stored as body fat ! all in all , it works really good for me and if you are an active person like i am , you should prolly go get yourself some . ( gnc also sells this for like 3 bucks
0	i bought the chair for my mother . she really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it . she loved it . it looks very nice , the size is alot bigger than what i thought it would be , which is a good thing . the only problem i have is that every time she uses it , one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose . she is very disappointed with that because she 's afraid to use it now . i 'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem , but it something that needs to be taken care of . aside from that , it took a very long time for the item to come in and i 'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it , and now she ca n't really even use it !
1	i purchased my leki nordic walking poles because i read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking . that is totally true ! i have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise . i do love to walk , but was hindered by the pain from my right hip . by using the walking poles , i am able to walk quickly without any pain at all , even though i am actually using more muscle groups than i would if walking without the use of poles . walking alone , a person only uses about 50 % of the large muscle groups . walking with leki nordic walking poles , one will use up to 90 % of all the large muscle groups ; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress ! ! i would not walk any other way now that i own my leki poles !
0	this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard . first of all , i thought this would be a bit larger . when i tried to go off of the ramp , my nose hit the front of it . not only is it not fun , but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around . if you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard , i recommend something else .
1	i am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table . it is sturdy , reasonably priced , and it was easy to assemble . instructions provided were clear and concise
0	i received this trike with 3 flat tires . the 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced . the valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced
1	this is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it , as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else . it is also useful for true accurate training , but a little humor never hurts
0	i consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds . i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big . i think that for a `` small '' backpack , that they are just too large . thank you
0	this pump did not work very well for me . must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help . i wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead
0	its light was okay , although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book . the main problem is it 's too shabby to survive a battery change -- so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out . also , finding 3v lithium batteries is not easy .
1	my 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for christmas . since his dad and i are divorced , he ended up with both . i got him the flowboard and he loves it . of course , i tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard . there is no chance i 'm even going to try the waveboard , as i do value my intact bones . i 've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding , but without the snow ! it 's well made , fun and definitely a hit
1	i had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me , i even tried using giro altas ii but not quite . good thing bell triton fit 's just right .
1	these flashlights are made in china . that is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional american brand such as smith wesson . i have two of these and i expect them to last me the rest of my life . ( i am 60 . ) a tad expensive ( which is why only four stars ) but small enough to be convenient , bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate . i bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever i am fiddling around with cables behind the tv or under the office desk or inside the computer . the small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool . i also bought the red-led version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision
1	ca n't really go wrong here . a metal post , some rubber grips , and a couple of wheels . it works great , and was the cheapest i found . just a tip , if you 've never used it before , do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet . you may be tough , but you might also hurt your back . start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times . on the 5th day , my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded , sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole .
1	i purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in aruba and i used it for 4 days of snorkeling . i had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time i decided to purchase a set . i am very pleased with this purchase . the fins are fantastic . the design of this fin from us divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it 's a great design feature ! the snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked . the set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in
0	the first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine . the problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time . i exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep pat . she was extremely nice and suggested i send it back for a replacement . the second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months . it now works a bit better than the first one . instead of stops working most of the time , this one stops working some of the time . i have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement . and who knows , the next unit may not work at all . not a good product for amazon to be selling . r lockwoo
0	the only thing on this that works well is the watch ... the altimeter , thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings ... the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience ... it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least .
0	i got the pedometer and from the start it does not work ! ! you have to physically shake it for it to count a step ! i 'm returning right away
1	i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping . it didnt take much pressure on the toes to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal . had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin . have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running . great product
1	we pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in northern mi , where weather is very unpredictable . we 've had other tents that took forever to set up , but this one was super simple . i think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready . we loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear . the air circulation was great , too . even in the heat of the day , we had a nice breeze keeping us cool , thanks to a miriad of windows . when rain came during the night , we stayed dry , though i would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent . overall , we 're really happy with this tent ( especially for the price ! ) , and plan to use it for several years
0	this pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking . those are the only good things i can say about it . it simply does not stay on . i , too , have had to use a safety pin to make sure i do n't lose it . maybe i have a defective device , but this is anything but accurate . i consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day . one day the steps will be 5800 , the next day 12800 , the next day 10300 . which is accurate ? are any of them ? i ca n't rely on it . when testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps , it never got it right . most of the time it was over the 50 steps , 2 times it was way under the 50 steps . i would not recommend this one
0	i only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began . it started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else . very annoying ! also , the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse . while it is a low impact machine , it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals . this is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout . i am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine . do not waste your money
1	i recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition . i only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000
1	i originally bought the blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) and the black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys . the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger . the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it . it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light , this makes it good for use anytime , anywhere . ( i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever ) if i had to do it again , i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip , probably have started with the red . just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping , the challenge is working out the fingers . it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers . it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts . great product , excellent for finger or hand exercise , good quality
0	i rarely get taken , but i did this time . one song played 50 times . no instructions . pad not in tune with tv movements . this is going to a garage sale or charity
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together , just took a few minutes , and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug
0	well , first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different , they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture . then when i sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product , no one returns my calls or e-mails me back , after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy . so yeah , if you want a better review , contact me so i can exchange the product
