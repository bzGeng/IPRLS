1	this is a good entry in the mr. moto canon , which comprises 8 films made between 1937-39 . it is not my favorite , however -- mr. moto takes a vacation , with excellent performances by lionel atwill and joseph schildkraut , is the best of those i 've seen . however , they have been very hard to find , and i 've only seen about half of them . lorre is wonderful as the mysterious mr. moto , and the films are great fun and skilfully made , with a host of terrific character actors -- in addition to atwill and schildkraut , leon ames , jean hersholt , keye luke , john carradine , george sanders , virginia field , ricardo cortez , maxie rosenbloom , and many others all turn in outstanding period performances . it is a real shame that more are not being made available -- i know that art houses sometimes stage special showings , and i keep hoping that someone will release all eight on dvd . please
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	this film stinks . it gives b scifi a bad name -- even makes those roger corman movies look stunning . if possible , i would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here . if you want cornball underwater action , buy `` voyage to the bottom of the sea . '' provided that your cerebral cortex is active , you 'll agree it 's a zillion times better
1	i had viewed this movie on tv a while ago . i am a hospice nurse and found this movie so down to earth and informative about what a person 's thoughts might be in the face of a debilitating condition . most of the nurses that i work with have gained new insight . lest i lead you astray this is not a documentary for medical personnel . it is a wonderful protrayal of one woman 's battle
1	i finally made my first purchase from amazon 's unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience . for $ 1.99 , i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of `` the twilight zone '' , and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection . i do n't think it 's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures , but for a 26-minute classic tv program , i think my 17 '' lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience , and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean . aired on september 15 , 1961 as the show 's third season opener , the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called `` two '' about the last two survivors on earth , a man and a woman , after an apocalyptic world war in 2109 . written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman , the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier . like two feral animals , they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war . he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him . the reality of their solitary existence , however , gradually dawns on them , especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - `` prekrassnyi '' - the russian word for `` lovely '' . what really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting . two years before she twitched her nose on `` bewitched '' , a brunette elizabeth montgomery , looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun , plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability . the american is played by perennial tough-guy charles bronson , fresh from `` the magnificent seven '' . even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war , he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism . they make an odd couple , but it works splendidly . i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century . narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner , the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript : `` this has been ... a love story . '' this is classic tv
0	movie got 2/3 through and just quit . no problem , this is windows right ? just reboot and start where you left off . only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning . i 'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again . only a couple bucks , but definitely not worth it
1	`` the spy who came in from the cold '' gets inside your veins like cold , bullying ice and by the end of the movie you feel numb . based on the famous novel by john le carre , director martin ritt seems determined to reveal the ugly reality of espionage ( on both sides of the iron curtain ) as it really was . alec leamas , the haunted british spy for the u.s. has nothing to do with james bond . richard burton gives such a phenomenal performance as this rancid , cranky , solitary alcoholic ( he was n't entirely acting ) that one ca n't help but wonder why he didnt get the oscar for best performance that year . leamas is , in his own words , `` just a bloody man '' , tired of all the ideologies on both sides of the fence which lead to all the horrors and betrayals he has witnessed and been a full participant in . his paradox is a painful one ; rejecting `` karl marx , god , and all the rest of it '' , he is also a man beginning to realize that his career in espionage is one of sheer immorality . claire bloom 's nan perry is the catalyst for the tragic and unforgettable ending of the film . a young woman leamas meets while he works in a london library awaiting his next assignment from the charming and bone-chilling head of operations in britan , george smiley , she is also an avowed communist . when things come to a head and she is dragged into the brutal world leamas inhabits , he tries desperately to communicate that she is only `` a frustrated little girl from a crackpot library '' . but the most heinous betrayal here is leamas ' skillful befriending and cold use of real communist oskar werner . leamas pretends to defect from the british agency and stages a brawl with a grocer to increase his appearance of discontent . werner is the to whom he discloses fictitious `` secrets '' about american espionage , all the while having cynical and hilarious dialogues with him about the whole situation . at the end , with two victims of the dirty business he 's involved himself in for some vague principle ( protecting the `` moronic masses '' ) , leamas can not go on . he is very much on the fence so to speak and ends up on the wrong one quite intentionally . a haunting , beautiful movie .
0	this film has been re-released as `` meltdown . '' there are a few reasons for watching this movie : 1 ) jet li . 2 ) chingmy yau ( the reporter ) . 3 ) wu ma ( frankie 's dad ) 4 ) a decent fight scene at the end . jacky cheung is also not as aggravating as usual . that 's it . jet li has appeared in three or four films directed by wong jing , and , just as chow yun fat does in god of gamblers and jackie chan does in city hunter , he does what he can . the direction of the film , however ( as well as gog and ch ) , stinks . the plot copies die hard and speed , with some broad satire aimed at jackie chan , but that is not the problem . put simply , jackie chan knows how to direct a film . wong jing does not . if you want to see jet li , go see fist of legend , once upon a time in china , or just about anything else he has done . if you want to see a good hong kong action movie , watch films directed by john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , jackie chan , and sammo hung . jet li is fun to watch , but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	given high acclaims this film has collected over time , i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale . began to watch it last night . i was able to sit thru the part 1 . when the tape ended , i was actually glad . i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1 ! the movie is dreary to the max . people portrayed are irrational , lost , uncommunicative , and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers . in some way , this movie reminded me of the dreary winter ( lasting 6 months ! ) i spent in russia a couple of years ago ... to me , the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state ( 1920-1956 ) . for survivors , nothing made any sense anymore , except perhaps fear and evil , as people in this dreary film reflects . people have been already destroyed in their souls . they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience . maybe that is the real meaning of this movie . to really reflect what happened to people 's psyche after lenin and stalin 's unlimited terror , they found a parallel in mongol 's devastation and oppression of medieval russia . in both cases , people were left shattered , helpless , irrational , withdrawn , and autistic .
1	this arty quirky film about a new years eve gone wrong in the mid- 80s is one of my favorites . was the first time i saw kate hudson and she is so sweet and funny in this one . martha plimpton is a riot as the overwrought hostess with a failed party on her hands . ben affleck is actually semi-funny for once- he is trying desperately to get into someone 's pants- watch and see who he starts the new year with . courtney love and paul rudd are friends- she wants to be more but she scares him ... . indy gal j. garafolo is her dark and dismal chain smoking wisecracking self and fun again . dave chappel is the cabby who tells the tale . fun ! romantic comedy a guy will like ! -- .
0	it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end . and about 2/3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion
1	i would have to say this was a brilliant movie . i was highly entertained from this mr.corman and hill flick . beautiful women getting roughed up , from the somewhat feminine guards . pam grier gets your full attention
1	i am hopeful that katie holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be . it 's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant , but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as april burns , a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family 's upstate home to a tenement in manhattan 's lower east side . encouraged by her new boyfriend bobby ( who happens to be black ) , she invites her estranged family to thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment . there is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer , and this may be their last meal together directed and written by peter hedges ( who wrote the equally eccentric `` what 's eating gilbert grape ? `` ) , the story bounces back and forth between april 's hazard-ridden preparation of the meal and the burns family 's chaotic journey to the city . while the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year 's `` little miss sunshine '' , april 's adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors , all strangers at first , to borrow a working stove for her turkey . among others , she runs into a friendly black couple , an obsessive vegan and an elderly chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday . on top of this is an odd , racially-driven storyline involving bobby 's need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters . shot in digital video by tami reiker and running only eighty minutes , the 2003 movie works toward an inevitable conclusion , but hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be . among the supporting cast , patricia clarkson stands out as april 's mother joy , bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface . oliver platt is terrific as her put-upon husband jim , as are derek luke as bobby and allison pill as april 's `` perfect '' little sister beth . in little more than cameos which could have been excised , sean hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog , while dru hill 's sisqo plays bobby 's friend latrell . hedges provides a nice commentary track on the 2004 dvd , which also includes a fifteen-minute making-of featurette
1	al pacino gives the best in this movie . shakespeare 's play set on an authentic set in venice with excellent photography - nobody could ask for more . at least subprime lenders ca n't demand a pound of flesh .
0	i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average `` bad guys on the run '' movie . gee , billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all ; he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel . this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
0	i like films that push things to the edge and address taboos , so i was looking forward to this exploration of kink , sadomasochism and nazism , written and directed both by women . -- hey , it sure promised to be original . you ca n't say `` oh , not *another* movie about a female concentration camp prisoner who grows fond of her tormentor and wants to continue their sadomasochistic relationship a decade later . '' but despite all the promise of debauchery and a probing of the dark side of human nature , the night porter , after the first 40 minutes at least , comes off as a confused , muddled , nonsensical and ultimately unintentionally-comic film , with an arbitrary ending that seemed to happen only because the filmmakers looked at their watch and said , `` we 're coming up on two hours . '' the first part of the film , where lucia recognizes her old captor , now a humble night porter at a vienna hotel , is well-done . while i found dirk bogarde to be a little wooden , charlotte rampling is perfect as the woman -- you can still see the scars , but she does n't overplay them ; there 's quiet dignity , but also the capacity to feel pain . a scene where she goes to the opera and sees bograde watching her , and flashes back to her predicament as she absent-mindedly rubs her once-chained wrists , is understated . too bad the rest is n't on that level . unfortunately , this understatement soon gives way to a second half that 's ridiculously over the top . bogarde belongs to a sort of `` support group '' for ex-nazi camp officers , and together they try to buck each other up , as well as destroy evidence of their past crimes . i found this subplot laughable -- i doubt real nazi guards ever participated in dr. phil-type rap sessions . there 's another sub plot about a gay former ss-guard who 's now a ballerina and dances for bogarde . i found this subplot bizarre . this thread sort of fizzles out halfway through the movie , and i 'm at a loss as to why it was there in the first place . then there 's the main plot line , which as i said startes off interestingly , but gets pretty silly by the second half , wherein bogarde and rampling find themselves cut off from food and being shot at by the other former ss guards , like insurgents holed up in a hideout . if that sounds weird , it is weird . the second half makes no literal sense , and one of the former ss-guards himself points out the foibles in bograde 's actions ( `` chain can be cut . `` ) , yet the film asks us to continue to take it seriously . then the ending just comes , out of the blue , with no explanation . sorry , but this was n't an `` exploration '' into the decadence or dark side of the human soul , or of ss decadence . this was sexploitation in nazi garb . the flashback where rampling dances for the officers in the bar , though sexy in a perverse sort of way , is also silly . she 's supposed to be this meek and frightened concentration camp victim , yet she 's dancing like she was born to it . i do n't see an exploration of anything . i just see an attempt at sexy sadomasochism . rampling is so good she *almost* sells me on this , but the others are rather stiff , some of the dialogue is laughable , and the second half is all disjointed . for once criterion drops the ball in terms of presentation . the non-anamorphic dvd utilizes a somewhat faded , beat-up print . the sound is not very good , even for 1974 mono . there are no extras at all , not even a trailer , not a commentary , nada . if this is an attempt to `` explore '' and `` examine '' our dark side , an analysis by the filmmaker or a film scholar would have been welcome . maybe that person could have made heads or tails of this story 's resolution . i can not , and i can not recommend this disc very strongly . it only has rampling 's performance to redeem it , and in the end , that 's not quite enough
1	knowing that `` stray dog '' was a movie by akira kurosawa gave me high expections and i was not disappointed . the movie starts out as a sort of beaurocratic comedy as a plain clothes officer named murakami has his pistol stolen by a pick pocket . despite the embarassment , it was a matter that could affect his continued employment with the force . as he starts to track down which pickpocket might have done the job , it becomes apparent that the gun has been used in a violent crime . at this point , the officer gets teamed up with an old pro named sato and the two are on the hunt for a serious criminal . the plot may sound semi-standard but , as in most kurosawa movies i 've seen , the excellence is n't in the story but in its ' telling . there are several scenes of murakami wandering through tokyo that reminded me somewhat of `` the bicycle thief '' . there is a lot of psychological aspects to this movie such as murakami 's efforts to reconcile the use of his gun in the hands of a violent criminal . in the conversations between the two detectives we hear the hardened outlook of sato on the criminal element in society . murakami shows the occassional fine line between cop and thief which may have been kurosawa 's main point in `` stray dog '' . there are many other interesting aspects to the movie and i 'm sure more will emerge each time i see it . the movie has the added aspect of being a fairly good thriller . toshiro mifune plays murakami and it seemed strange to see him clean cut throughout the movie . takashi shimura plays sato and the two work very well together . all of the acting is well done as well as the directing and the writing . kurosawa shows in `` stray dog '' that he is as comfortable in the present as he is in the past .
1	download takes awhile , but the picture quality was great , even full screen . it played all the way through . and , to boot , it 's an excellent show
0	comparing oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the vegas casinos of yesteryear and today . the hippest casinos of that era were , by today 's highest standards of casino elegance and class ( no , i 'm not talking about excalibur ) , dull , smokey , hokey , and cramped - just like the original oceans 11 . i 'm as fascinated with the rat pack as much as anyone , but i think it 's important to take the rose colored glasses off when critiquing the work of these sometimes neurotically insecure and deeply flawed individuals in order to judge a movie on its own merits . i think too many peoples ' sense of self identity is reflected in the image of the rat pack to ever really do objectivity justice . humor and style do evolve ( my father , for example , finds no humor in some of the most critically acclaimed shows on tv today ) , so it 's hard to compare two different eras . nevertheless , great , timeless cinema came out of this era , but this work is not in that category . by any movie standards it drags heavily and its `` hipness '' seems contrived and forced into an otherwise hokey vibe . the musical interludes and final stride down the strip are incredible for reinforcing this image ( and i do love them as stand alone moments ) , but jar so completely with the tone and style of the rest of the movie that i ca n't help but think this was just a vanity flick to satiate the appetites of fans hungry to devour media images of the highest style and pizzaz that era had to offer . regarding the issue of whether this movie appeals only to an older generation , it should be noted that those in the younger generation who have reviewed this movie favorably are teenagers . there may be something deeper at work here - an adolscent ( or arrested adolesecent ) quest for a two-dimensional , this-is-what-cool is mantra by fans of any age . to me this movie is little more than a vain time capsule revealing how much tighter , interesting , and more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society at large has become . that said , there 's still an audience for the old school casino in which dank slot machines greet you at the door on the way to the cheap buffets , just as there is and always will be an audience that smugly holds this 1960s ocean 11 as superior . i know i 'll take a hit in terms of `` was this review helpful '' points from this crowd , but by the nature of who they are they got away with a lot that would never compel an objective viewer free from the folklore enmeshed in this intriguing group 's fame .
0	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment , but overall it 's long and pretty boring . it seems it would have been better suited as a play , which apparently it was originally . i had just finished re-reading romeo and juliet when i rented this , thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood , but this did n't do it for me . i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet , it would have been better . my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries , completely amusing . could n't wait for the movie to end , honestly
1	barry levinson 's diner is a rich panoramic snapshot of a time , people and place that 's treasured by those of us who lived through that period and had paralell experiences . he 's a master of his craft and so are all that contributed to this work
1	in 1997 , forty years after julie andrews performed the title role live in rodgers and hammerstein 's tv production of cinderella , r singer brandy brought the role to life in tv 's third incarnation of this musical classic , produced by the wonderful world of disney and whitney houston , who played the fairy godmother . ratings were huge for the program , and it even won an emmy . this new production is different from the previous two in several ways . for one , this one is a made-for-tv movie , whereas the previous two were shot as if they were televising a play . this new version also has three new songs - the sweetest sounds , written by richard rodgers , the music 's in you , and falling in love with love , written by richard rodgers and lorenz hart . updated special effects , more modern vernacular , a more empowered cinderella , and a color-blind casting approach lend a freshness to the classic fairy tale . and i 'm not too thrilled with all the complaints about the mixed cast . i , for one , am thrilled that little girls and little boys can watch this and see themselves represented , no matter what race they are . it 's nice that for once , a little african american girl can see herself as the object of desire . and yes , the black queen and white king have an asian son . families like that are not uncommon today . funny that people do n't have a problem with a pumpkin becoming a carriage or mice becoming horses , but they have a problem with this . a few flaws exist in the film . the cgi effects are sometimes a little too obvious , such as in the pumpkin transformation sequence . and although brandy is sweet and lovely as cinderella , she 's no julie andrews . these flaws do not detract from the general charm of this production , and do n't put me off at all . i love brandy 's performance , and her more modern feminist approach to the character of cinderella . however , disney needs to release a new dvd version . this dvd is one of the first disney dvds ever - in fact , this dvd predates the `` disney dvd '' brand and logo . the bonus features include a home video release trailer and `` a cinderella story '' featurette . i think it 's time to update this dvd release . the transfer is very good , but could possibly use a bit of remastering . maybe some retrospective bonus materials . and , since an official soundtrack was never released , a music-only track would also be a nice idea . maybe some audio commentary from the actors and producers and such . despite all the flaws of this dvd treatment and the flaws of the production itself , it 's definitely a dvd i was thrilled to find for $ 10 at a local drug store , because i 've loved this production ever since it first aired in november of 1997 on abc . it 's definitely worth buying
1	i think this is a great film . many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it 's running time ( 128 minutes ) , insisting it 's too slow . almost all of clint 's films ( the ones he 's directed ) run long . the running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours ( the longest being bird , at 2 hours , 40 minutes ) . sure , the film is n't pc , but it was made in 1975 , when you did n't have to be pc . but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on ... the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film . these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic . clint did all his own stunts in these sequences , and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences . and they are very intense to watch , because you know the actors are really up there . no cgi in those days . this is one of the reasons they work so well . cgi looks fake anyway . it makes movies seem like cartoons . people know it is n't real . cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood , as it takes the tension out of action scenes . check this film out . it 's worth all of its 128 minutes .
1	juliette binoche is an amazing actress . since her best supporting actress oscar for `` the english patient '' in 1996 and her nomination for `` chocolat , '' she 's an actress whose films i seek . `` the widow of saint-pierre '' has a bit of irony to the title . the opening frames show binoche in black staring out of a window . we then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward . we learn that the `` widow '' is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from france before the big execution can take place . we see director emir kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner neel whose rehabilitation binoche 's madame la seeks . we keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner . daniel autereil who won a cesar ( french oscar ) for his work with director patrice leconte for `` ridicule '' in 1996 plays the lovestruck captain who is in charge of the execution . spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife , he thwarts the town 's sentence of death at every turn , refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore . in the moment of ultimate irony , neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore , which is sure to result in his own execution . the bloody resolution and the final shots of binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion . patrice leconte has a great reserve , shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic . this is an incredibly tragic romance , one that works exquisitely . enjoy !
1	`` i gather there are some people beyond that darkness out there , but if i do n't look you in the eye it 's because i do n't see you , i only see the darkness . '' that quote is found toward the beginning of `` manufacturing consent '' and is taken from a lecture chomsky was about to give in an auditorium where apparently no house lights were available . i 'm unsure if anything more revealing was intended by chomsky 's opening comment , although it 's impossible not to read something more into it . the breadth of information offered in `` manufacturing consent '' is manifold , shedding light on two primary subjects . one : noam chomsky , his life , childhood , his anarchist convictions which fueled his decision early on to place a lesser degree of import on an easy going , comfortable career in linguistics in favor of an uncertain , often tumultuous life of political activism and dissent . two : the oligarchy in which existence is ensnared . the necessary illusions which are implemented to deceive and brainwash the populace , tricking them into believing that they actually have a representative form of democratic government and indeed have a hand in decision making policy . and of course , the media ; a broad apparatus used to manufacture the people 's consent , ensuring that an appropriate percentage of the populace will be effectively indoctrinated and hoodwinked into supporting the agenda of the ruling class and its military power , or , will be effectively depoliticized , tuned out and away from crucial matters which directly impact the quality of social and individuated life . most of what is seen on television , be it news , sports , situation comedies , movies , whatever the programming , serve as little more than an advertisement for a specific mindset resulting in a strategically wished for outcome . at one point someone asks chomsky `` how do the elites control the media ? '' he replies , `` how do elites control gm ? ... because they own it . '' look at institutional power as an entity : they have their own `` news '' division . in fact , it 's thee news division . naturally those who comprise this power structure at all of its various levels understand that to serve the proper role , especially if one wishes to `` get ahead '' is *not* to actively undermine the structure 's agenda by telling the truth and revealing its own crimes . `` manufacturing consent '' is a remarkable film . you see chomsky interacting with all sorts of people , students , interviewers , average people who he 's inspired , and even those who obviously despise him for daring to speak a truth which conflicts with prevailing ( media induced ) ideology , one that their own self deceptive belief structure demand be untrue in order to maintain a delusional , happy consciousness . as chomsky asks , `` do the facts matter , or do n't they ? '' for him it comes down to a single question : can you look at yourself in the mirror ? another telling moment comes when chomsky is asked to recall a childhood incident which left an indelible impression . he tells of a time where the standard fat kid was being picked on at the playground with everyone taunting him as someone 's older brother was on the way to beat him up , and chomsky was impelled to do the right thing , so he went and stood next to the fat kid as a display of solidarity , but was eventually intimidated and walked away . he says the shame he felt for doing so never went away , has always stayed with him , and that the lesson learned was to never do that again , and that you always stand with the underdog . `` as any change must begin somewhere , it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through . '' ~ carl jung
1	i recommend this movie as a most usually high star . the torch song trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do ( i will leave it to you to identify what that is ) . the torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen , who is more than what she appears to be on stage . it identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it . this movie is inspirational , comical , sad , and dramatic . there is no other movie of its kind , and no other movie compares . the movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want , it is acceptance , and if you can not do that then get out . this is a must have . the only five star movie i have ever watched
1	received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems
1	what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer , but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person . how can you criticise someones life story ? to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw , and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp ? i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise
0	private resort is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres . however , i 'm sure this film is one that johnny depp , hector elizondo and rob morrow are n't proud to have on their resume . the movie 's plot is slim , and neither morrow or depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers . elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs , but he 's not at his best either . most of the film 's laughs come from leslie hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo ; dody goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and tony azito as a bumbling hotel security guard . there 's lots of slapstick , some of it works , most of it does n't . you can do better , folks
1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east ( mainly china 's ) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy . yi soon shin , however , is a rare exception . not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the chosun political factions ( and the second-guessing nature of the king ) which causes his eventual death . also , the special effects are great . the battle scenes ( whether on sea or land ) are realisitic and of outstanding quality . the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china . then again , this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral . also , the entire selection should have 104 episodes . i do n't know why it stops at 101 . if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject , try samuel hawley 's imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources ) . any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion ( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun : total war by creative assembly ( now in gold version ) .
0	only worth the second stop-motion sequence , when flesh fights a robot twig . that scene is almost flawless and as good as any harryhausen animation . the one love scene with flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice . the film is worth a rent if your curious but it 's really just a lame and unfunny movie . if your open to seeing a trashy sci-fi satire of flash gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look . especially fans of stop-motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences
0	even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television , some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles . this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format , and for that reason i wo n't be getting the region 1 release of this film
1	clint eastwood 's `` the eiger sanction '' was made in 1975 and was , at that time , an excellent action thriller . viewing it again recently , i was surprised at how well it has held up . this is due mostly to the location shoots - filmed in monument valley and in the swiss alps instead of on a hollywood soundstage . these guys really went up there and filmed those climbing sequences for real ( including star and director eastwood , who was about 45 at the time ) , and that just ca n't be faked . the spy story is also pretty good , there is an excellent supporting performance by jack cassidy , and vonetta mcgee and george kennedy lend solid support . also , john williams ' pre-star wars score is hauntingly jazzy and suspenseful . check this one out
1	you know how every single american english class in ever single school in america has to read at least one mark twain book ? well , the same circumstance should be set for this film in relation to modern american history courses . one of the best political thrillers , in all fairness it 's not a fast moving film , it 's a slow , intricate film full of small details that add up to one big story , and one of the absolute best american films of the 70 's all the president 's men is a story of , besides watergate , of two small worker ants who go on to destroy what already was a disasterous affair , which if not uncovered , could have potentially gotten worse . hoffman , as per usual , hands in a flawless performance as does redford , an actor whose work i 'm none too familiar with or a fan of , and the supporting cast all around , particularly jason robards , shine like flawless diamonds in this essential , and inspirational , drama
1	i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels . up to this time i had never heard of it , but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing . as i continued to watch ( it had english subtitles fortunately ) i became enthralled by the acting , plot and historical theme . with a little detective work , i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes . i told my wife how good it was , and after we watched an episode together , she and i both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it . we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television . nearly every episode was better than 90 % of the hollywood movies out there . if you like , action , drama , amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors , intersting history , and some of the best writing i have seen on television , or anywhere for that matter , check this out
1	the story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues . the real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives . i had to watch the movie 's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished . i wonder what lawyers , fbi agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie . most of us do n't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers , and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot . the good guy , mitch mcdeere , wins over evil not only because he 's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck . mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.for example , mitch 's wife gets to know all of a sudden that gene hackman 's character ( who has important documents to copy ) is not going to dive as mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him . well , good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life . at the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer john grisham . the movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished . in real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail , even less killed by the good guys ; everybody knows this . what not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems . the movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into . finally , the suspense is well organized . moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes . yes , this is very compelling movie to recommend watching . beware that this movie deals at some degree with the conservative vs liberal cultural war . the bad guys had to be the southern conservatives who want to rule other people 's lives according to their own hypocrite standards . meanwhile the good guys are liberals from ne . i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows in negative ways . all i guess is that jg realized what would be accepted by the entertainment industry and wrote according to it . anyways , this is just a movie and it does what it 's supposed to do : to entertain
0	i love this film . it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing . i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd , unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used . i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches . in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture . i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves . i 'd have given 5 stars if it had , so the minus three is for the appaling print . one of the worst i 've ever seen
0	nothing but a lame excuse to show the overrated barrymore 's face on the screen again
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	i am appalled at the greed that disney must have to milk out a classic like `` the absent minded professer '' . i found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie . i found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by robin williams and marsha gay-hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that 's throughout all disney movies , or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves . i also feel that with the character of `` flubber '' it was a waste of time considering i do n't remember any merchandising from the character . they should 've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original . i also feel that with the promotion of the flubber substance that it was all shallow , and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military , and here it was to make a buck . i feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state , and not be remade , and this is one of them .
1	this two-reeler begins in the middle of the night . stan is suffering from a toothache , and his problem is keeping ollie up as well . nothing he does helps him , but predictably makes things even worse . all of the commotion in their room brings short-tempered landlord charley hall storming in , and the boys have a violent altercation with him that sends him off fuming . since everything has tried and failed , there seems no recourse but to go to the dentist . ( the scene in the dentist 's office was later remade in their first feature film , 1931 's 'pardon us . ' ) things do n't look good here either , since all of the patients are being carried out on stretchers . stan resists going in , but is dragged there anyway . he 's terrified of having the tooth pulled , and to calm him , ollie says he 'll show him how easy it is . unfortunately , the dentist , who was asked to leave the room during this , tells his assistant he 's done for the day and to go in and pull the tooth of the guy in the chair . ollie ends up being snuck up on and chloroformed , with his tooth the one that 's pulled . ollie is so furious that he gets into a scuffle with stan , and during this they release laughing gas from one of the tubes . the two of them begin laughing hysterically , and soon two of the nurses are laughing as well . ( the theme of starting to laugh and then getting more and more carried away and hysterical was to be revisited in a few of their other films , such as 'blotto . ' ) the boys are still laughing up a storm as they get in their car and try to drive away , causing chaos and road rage all around them , not to mention the wrath of slow-burning cop edgar kennedy . this is a solid comedy all around , with not a dull or wasted moment , and a great combination of both physical and situational comedy . it 's also a fascinating look back at how dentistry was conducted in the twenties . today dentists use novacaine instead of laughing gas and chloroform , and it 's no longer routine procedure to just pull teeth that are giving one a problem instead of just drilling the cavity or infected area out and putting a filling in
0	okay , it 's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion . it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis . on the other hand , the film lacks true suspense . i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn . the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum . the pacing is too slow at times and it just does n't stand up that well today . the actors who took part in this did n't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel . why there was a sequel is beyond me . i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time . at the most this is a rent not a buy . i guess good for it 's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story .
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father . a must see
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	having enjoyed lost in translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems to have some sort of cult reputation -- why i ca n't fathom . the entire plot is self-serving , shallow , and unrealistic . i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values , and while i do n't condone those , the film lacks clear characters or any motivation . a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it , and it does n't mean they kill themselves -- because they were grounded ! ? since the writer-director gerw up in hollywood , she may not be aware that you ca n't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason -- social workers and what not come after you . so the entire premise is false . romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it -- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers -- could actually encourage the act . it 's not caring , not real , and not responsible . but i guess that would n't bother the rich , overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself .
0	peter segal 's `` anger management '' is a film with nothing going for it . it is best described as boring , annoying , and devoid of laughs . mild-mannered dave buznik ( adam sandler ) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding . he immediately develops a problematic relationship with buddy rydell ( jack nicholson ) , the self-help expert leading the sessions . as the two men spend more and more time together , buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling . `` anger management '' just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like . it is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly . sandler and nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker . furthermore , the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings . truth be told , `` anger management '' is one of those projects that was green-lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality .
1	however , noone has commented on one interesting fact.. theres a episode missing ! the orginal miniseries is 10 hours long.. theres 2 hours missing.. and the part where they attack the processing plant is `` too soon '' .. unfortunately , i do n't remember whats missing.. but it seems that it belongs before the first ep presented on this dvd set !
1	i love this movie . and i do n't have anything bad to say about it . but if you get the dvd be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match . so you hear an actor speak before their mouths move . this drove me crazy but i still enjoyed the movie
1	siri amster- olszewski august 24 , 2006 emma , by jane austen , was one of the most enjoyable books i have read recently . i chose to read emma because , having read and loved pride and prejudice by the same author , i wanted to explore her other books as well . the characters in austen 's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those times i was enchanted with emma because austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time . it provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . one of the book 's principle topics is marriage . the main character , emma , approves of matchmaking for marriage and , through her , the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage . for some people , marriage was simply a way to advance in social status ; for others , marriage was for love . in emma 's time , marriages had to be matched according to social status . one could not marry below their status . marrying too far above one 's status could end up disastrously . the book tells the story of emma woodhouse who is a pretty , wealthy , poised , and clever young woman . her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess , miss taylor . miss taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for emma . therefore , emma grew up without any firm rules or structure . this freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions . it was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself . jane austen , by the style of her writing , creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations . for example , while emma 's faults are very apparent , i found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character . other examples of characters like emma are jain fairfax , harriet smith , and mr. elton . in contrast the character of mr. knightly , the family friend is set in stone . within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story . mr. woodhouse , mr. weston , mrs. weston ( the former miss taylor ) , frank churchill , and miss bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling , the feeling that austen intended . these characters all have good and bad qualities , all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader . the novel is written in third person , however the detached narrator often sees through emma 's point of view . having the effect of a not so neutral bystander . i highly recommend emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted , witty book that captivates and enchants . while reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of jane austen 's masterpieces .
0	will not play once video was downloaded . i get the error message : `` can not play file , please try again later . error # 0x80040273 '' i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed , i was told the unbox saturday and sunday 6-5 hours . i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature . i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem . thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again - feb. 10,200
0	this video did not live up to my expectations . i have a five-year-old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close . the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression . instead , ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with , and focuses on puppy socialization in the video . well , that 's great if i had a puppy , but i adopted an older dog , and i need help now . i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems . if you have a puppy , it might be somewhat helpful , but there are better books
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	this movie could 've been something , had they gotten some real actors , a script and a director . well , they did n't , and this movie is an embarassment to mankind
1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television . although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past , the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode . the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show . the acting for the most part is top notch , and kristen bell , who plays veronica , is amazing . i especially enjoyed episode 9 , spit and eggs , in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus .
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
1	`` father goose : was a movie i had seen and enjoyed a long time ago , i rembered the name of the film , but could not find it locally . i contacted `` amazon '' , its was in stock and i received it in a few days . i was very pleased with your quick attention to my simple request . i will be coming to you for future purchases .
0	i 've been a timothy dalton fan ever since i saw jane eyre , but this movie is difficult to take even for the most devoted . please do not waste your money
1	i really ca n't say anything new that has n't been said about this great movie , except read jean shepherd 's novels ... you will get a whole new appreciation for the movie and the characters that have become a part of so many of our lives . thank you darren mcgavin for giving us the best christmas present ever
1	masterful , simply masterful . there is no other word that can adequately convey the quality of this movie . every time i notice it on cable , i immediately stop whatever i am doing and follow it to conclusion . i can think of no other shakespearean film that echoes it except possibly , `` the tragedy of julius caesar '' ( marlon brando as marc anthony ) . a commanding performance by kenneth branaugh , who should be knighted as a peer of the realm in my opinion , before another title is handed over to a rolling stone . this film is the sole reason i still have vhs . if anyone enjoyed this movie , i highly recommend the brando version of julius caesar and henry the fifth 1989 - kenneth branaugh and see if you notice a young christian bale - the boy who would be batman . i have had many lively discussions with respected elders regarding the better shakespearean actor - olivier or branaugh . my money 's on branaugh
0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 , it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story . wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download ! ! !
1	i came away from this movie thinking - wow , i wish i was like john tucker ! i have never seen anyone make lemonade out of lemons like that man . he was good and fine to boot . i thought it was entertaining . it was clearly more of a teenager movie , but i thought it was fun . definitely worth a check out .
1	this is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy ( anton glanzelius ) who tries to make sense of his mother 's terminal illness , death in general , and a world full of change . he tries to cheer his mother up as best he can , but she is too far gone to really notice or care . his fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better . as a coming-of-age movie , sex plays an important ( and confusing ) part for the boy , from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him , to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts . the movie is full of wonderful , insightful touches . glanzelius is marvelous . a real gem of a movie
0	when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director.to bad this one is n't a very good story . this mess came out at the heigth of the `` slasher '' movie frenzy . but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also . the theme of 4 kids who , now hold on here , think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival . before you can say `` please kill me '' the `` thing '' is picking them off one by one . with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen , but no , they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins . this bore last to long
1	i viewed this film a few years ago when i had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece . luis buñuel 's direction is unique . i found that the main character 's desposition changes his love for the woman . when she gets him angry , we see one woman . when she makes him happy , we see a different woman in the same character . i do n't think i 've seen a movie quite like this . this movie will stay with you for some time , especially if you have a broken heart .
1	katie holmes plays april , a young woman whose family has despaired of her . she has invited them for thanksgiving dinner , and it 's particularly important because her mother ( patricia clarkson ) has cancer and is not expected to live . katie is living in nyc with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti-covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in ny -- in other words , it will terrify her non-urban family . the film begins as katie wakes up -- she 's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family . in fact , her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her -- no-one could be that bad , and is n't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you , and not the other way around ? patricia clarkson was amazing in this film ; she is batty but at times her battiness is just simply playing with her family ( there 's a method in her madness ) . my only criticism would be that the whole subplot about what katie 's boyfriend is off doing while she 's *trying* to cook the turkey -- well , that subplot just did n't work for me . otherwise , this was a memorable film worth watching more than once
1	i surprisingly enjoyed this movie . it is a little choppy and hard to understand what is going on at first , but it is well worth the watch . especially if you are a werewolf movie fan
1	this is my first bergman . ( and i did not pay $ 36 for it . i bought it for 99 cents on ebay , completely new , played fine . ) i bought several bergmans ( almost all from ebay , they 're very expensive otherwise ) when his name kept popping up in connection with woody allen , a hero of mine . i liked this movie very much , it was warm and soothing and interesting . i was struck at first with the simplicity of the symbols and the extremely detailed direction ( e.g . when the old man starts while leaving the room to move a chess piece , then changes his mind and continues on out of the room ) . i have 6 of his films left to watch and i 'm looking forward to them , particularly the ones with dubbed in english , which most of them are . as for its being similar to a woody allen flick , all that comes to mind is `` another woman . '' but i 'll hold my tongue ( fingers ) , i have 6 more to see . what really does come to mind , and the reason i gave this flick such a mediocre rating , is `` a christmas carol '' ! it 's better than i ever thought dickens was , but the dickens came first . i loved the movie until i realized that
1	i will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot . the 'geek ' boy falls in love with the alternative girl , while she 's already fallen for someone else , who is a complete jerk . of course , they end up together in the end . however , most movies are bought for the newness , the originality , and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf . this movie captures attention through other avenues . the characters are charming , and everyone will relate to this movie , and say 'hey , that sounds like someone i know ' . ths soundtrack is fabulous , and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by everclear , that , although short , is very impressive . my advice : rent this . if you like it the first time you see it , then proceed to buy it , because you always will . if you 're not keen on it , then do n't bother
1	a wonderful version of sinbad the sailor . great sets , costumes , and story line . douglass fairbanks is great in it
1	vincent price at his best ! ! ! i was amazed at his interpretation of usher . it was very much like the hyper sensitive fellow of poe 's tale ! ! ! the ending was shocking . i recommend this item to everybody . good acting , very good indeed

1	kit and holly are presented in this story by terrence malick as total innocents , living in a prelapsarian state , completely unaware of right and wrong , good and evil , and ignorant of guilt or sin . they have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions ; in effect , they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight , and can barely empathise with each other , let alone other people . things just happen , as holly sees it . kit does n't feel hostility to the people he kills : they are merely in his way . there is no remorse . he is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him . these kids are like adam and eve , with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden , but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death . holly throws out her sick catfish , showing no feeling . her dog is shot as a punishment by her father , indicating he , too , is careless of death or pain . kit stands on a dead cow , as though puzzled by its absence of life . neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much . in one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric , animalistic past , where the younger man simply eliminates the older , in order to secure a mate for himself . just the way of nature , and beyond criticism . apparently , so i 've read somewhere , this is the mindset of the criminal , who can not see what he is doing wrong . he has to get by , somehow , and takes the easiest path . why work , when you can steal ? if obstacles arise , eliminate them . people are ok , otherwise . live now , die later . this is an extraordinary film , superbly acted
0	i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004 . i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie , but it was really lackluster . the acting is wooden , the script is very lame , and worst of all , the action is n't very exciting . i expected a much better movie from director richard donner . there is a battle scene , and there are action scenes , but they just are n't exciting . when the action is n't exciting , you better have a good story . the story here is alright , but certainly not enough to save the movie . i do n't hate any of the actors , they are decent when they have something to work with . here they had nothing to work with , so they obviously did n't do too well this time . this really is n't worth your time . i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it , and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there
1	i 've loved this movie since the first time i saw it . if you like jack nicholson and meryl streep , you wo n't be dissappointed with this movie .
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	i have to confess that i went to tears watching this movie , and usually i do n't get emotional easily . it 's so touching , a phd professor of middle age find out that she is sick . ovarian cancer . it was a shock for her , the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react . all through the movie , she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering . there is a `` brilliant '' young doctor ( yes , one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what , with a big ego , the big shot of the class ) who was her student in one of her literature classes . it made me very angry , his attitude , because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way , only thinking in the results of the research . i want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way . but once in a while you can find one of these ... . weird specimen . the nurse was nice and treated her in a better way . this kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans , not matter the title or knowledge you can have . and we are here to help each other , no taking advantadge of each other . i strongly recommend this movie ... just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you .
0	first , this piece of trash is based on the journey to the west about as much as raiders of the lost ark is based on the bible . there are some characters common to both lost empire and journey . well , common in name . that said let 's get to the real problem with this film . it is astoundingly insulting to chinese religious traditions . imagine for a moment some non-christian producing a film in which : the god jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to satan ; jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power ; and the virgin mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars . sound offensive ? it is . and this film is equally insulting to buddhism , taoism , and confucianism ( the three big ones in china ) . confucius , a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in lost empire as a lecherous , traitorous , lying , cowardly weasel . the jade emperor , taoism 's chief god , is shown as a despondent , apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms . kuan yin , one of the bodhisattvas , is shown in lost empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man . that is as likely as the virgin mary turning tricks on a street corner . if some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than the lost empire . it makes me wonder if the insult was intended .
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie . i 'm very glad i screened it first . the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow , boring , and illogical . i 'm not very pc with old movies , but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits . choose one of the other disney re-releases instead . there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog
1	i knew i should have waited ! i got impatient and bought the masterworks dvd and after watching it once could not bear to see it again , the colors were that awful . of course i have to get this , but it 's still galling . now if they would only release el amour brujo
0	i actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because i would have listened to a little of it just to see what barry levinson was thimking and i would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip . take a look at the man 's filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there . worse , he was n't alone , someone else liked the idea enough to co-write it . everyone else can blame a large paycheck , but levinson actually came up with the idea . this is one of the most beautiful terrible films i ever seen , if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie
1	funny and witty , this movie will keep you going , especially if you love the play by oscar wild
1	this was a great movie . true the cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside . if you do an indepth look you will realize all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries , and furthermore their personalities decribe what the prison is like . kazan ( autisic guy ) come from kazan prion in russia which is a psychiatric prison alderson comes from alderson prison in west virginia . this prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment . alderson died alone having never ran into anyone . rennes comes from rennes prison in france . rennes was kinda the groups mentor . he showed them 2 tips on how to survive , the group took these as policy . rennes prison is where most of modern prison policy originated . holloway comes from holloway prison in england . holloway is a prison for women leaven and worth come from leavenworth prison in kansas leavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj leaven is a whiz at . leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects . worth was an architect . quentin comes from san quentin prison in california . both quentin 's are brutal . the makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections . the plot was good also , total strangers with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive
1	overwhelming in sincerity and pain . to watch and observe stephan 's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time . this cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves . combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour i was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish . a great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list .
0	it wasnt all that bad . it had its moments . brad renfro ( bully ) , dominique swain ( face/off ) , keram malicki-sanchez ( tv 's buffy the vampire slayer ) , emily bergl ( the rage : carrie 2 ) , justin long ( jeepers creepers ) , james king ( bulletproof monk ) and jordan bridges ( mona lisa smile , son of jeff bridges ) star as camp counslers who have , well a lot of problems . peter stormare ( eight millimeter ) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp . emotions , relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way . james king ( former model ) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm . renfro and swain are so wrong for each other , they should be a couple in real life . bergl is hot to the bone . bridges is a bastard . long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others . stomare is just weird , plain weird and the kids are brats . so if you liked heathers , because daniel waters wrote it , then this is the movie for yo
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman . i also purchased it because of someone else 's amazon review ( they sounded like they really knew what they were talking about ) . i am glad i bought it used , because if it were new , i would feel that i 'd been cheated . the movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor 's office . there was no sense of suspense , and i was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea ( mind you , i 'm not the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy ) . the dialogue throughout was tedious and trite ; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line , as well as the director and the editor . the plot was , in some respects , totally illogical , and at other times nonsensical . even previous scenes do n't tie in neatly enough at the end . the plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible . the choices the characters make - whether restless , bored , frustrated - do n't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film ( like a greedy , unwashed vampire ) . the movie features a wealthy , bored couple . i was also bored . but i 'm not wealthy . however ! all the actors did their best within the limitations of this film . polly walker was very convincing as a sensitive , but hypercritical wife . in fact , i 'd say she provided the best performance , and her character was the most three-dimensional and human . they should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character . norman reedus was fairly genuine as the young man , although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive . he failed to grab my empathy . which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded , wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment . alan rickman did his usual subtle work , but it was so subtle that i thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming . his attempt at an american accent did not fly too well . later in the movie , however , he becomes much more interesting . the end lacked passion and was not surprising at all ; it was entirely predictable . for rickmanistas , yes , you get to see alan naked . so , just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy . i have always admired alan rickman - i 'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted directed film . so , i give it two stars . *yawn
0	this movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other . when does that ever happen ? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids . what 12 yr. old worries about `` ..never getting out of this small town. '' ? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends , then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense . i have a feeling oprah would like this movie .
1	this is definately not the best pink panther film . it is not as good as the other ones that i 've seen . i 've only seen the pink panther { 1964 } , a shot in the dark , this one , and the pink panther { 2006 } . if you are into the pink panther series just for peter sellers , you wo n't like this one . this film has a great cast . alan arkin as inspector jacques clouseau , frank finlay as supt . weaver , barry foster as addison steele , patrick cargill as commisioner sir charles braithwaite , beryl reid as the crazed mrs. weaver , clive francis as johnny rainbow , and introducing delia boccardo as lt. lisa morrel . you will definately laugh hysterically . as inspector clouseau says , `` there 's a time for laughing and a time for not laughing- and this is not one of them !
1	well , of course it 's that hokey romantic type . and , of course you see the ending coming from a mile away . of course we 've seen it all before . but , as far as entertainment value goes , it 's got it . reese witherspoon proves , once again , that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality . there 's really not much to the characters in this movie , but there does n't need to be . i was a little wary of the jon heder character , having just come off the great napolean dynamite buzz . but , i found his character interesting and did n't think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out , but he did a good job with what he had . you do n't have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one , but it works when you 're in the mood for a straightforward romance . it is what it is
1	`` to live , '' does not hold the same appeal for me as it once did in the past . however , i do recommend viewers to at least take a look at this film . the films narrative deals with the lives of fugui and jiazhen , a husband and wife with two children , as well as fugui 's mother . the time period is from the 1940s up to the 1980s . because fugui has a gambling problem the family loses everything : house and possessions , which splits the family apart . it is a time when the chinese nationalist 's and communist 's are battling for control of china . further , the film deals with the social upheaval that is afffecting the lives of many chinese . although the film never criticizes the changes incurred by mao tse tung , just the view of the how people 's lives were affected accomplishes this task very well . and although this film does not look deeply enough at the changes taking place in china in the chaotic 40s , 50s , and 60s with mao 's reforms and its affects on the people ; i do n't think that this is what the director had in mind . especially regarding the films main protagonists . on later viewings i realized that there was much missing in the film which could have made this a truly great film . as the viewer , one witnesses the changes occuring in china , but the real horror of mao 's reforms are put on the backburner . there is social upheaval occuring , but it appears tame in comparison to actual events . however , fugui and his pregnant wife are the films main protagonists , and the film is about their life in this new china . with poverty now a way of life , fugui decides to work at a puppet troupe . after the birth of their first child [ a son ] jiazhen returns to fugui , however , civil war has broken out causing fugui to leave for the fight . the rise of mao changes everything for these two individuals in the films narrative . and even though they have suffered [ as many other did too ] they never complain . the film never throws mao at the viewer , but he is left in the background of the film . however , this was a very clever use of directing in order to tell the story of these two individuals . this is a decent film of human tragedy , which i only feel could have been so much more . i recommend the film to those viewers [ rent it first ] who are not familiar with this period in chinese history . this is not a propaganda film , but a film about those caught in the unheaval of turbulent times . recommended . [ stars : 4.5
1	i saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head . it 's a beautiful english production that has a definite melancholy , bittersweet flavor that 's missing from other adaptations . really worth seeing . it is a kid-friendly version ? not really but smart teens may enjoy it . great performances from ralph richardson , peter sellers and fiona fullerton as alice
1	as a girl from russia i want to tell - this is a very good movie about turning point of my fatherland 's histor
1	this movie is great fun . i remember watching it quite a few times when i was a kid , and it is just as good now with this edition on dvd . interviews with both corey 's let you know a lot about what happened between the two of them and how they became friends . only disappointment is that corey haim comes across as a real stuck-up snob type of person . it makes you want to slap him because he seems so pompous . corey feldman was great to watch and he has n't changed much in the last 18 years . still a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoyed it when it was first released
1	my niece and i love the movie . we sing thumbelina all the time . the movie is a treasure . i just wish it had some special features worthy of the movie
1	one of th ebest comedies of the middle 90 's . this is basically your average `` rich kid learns to be a man '' story . it features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and the mermaid . if you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look
1	it was 13 years ago when i frist saw this movie and i simply loved it to death , then as said in the song `` little jackie paper found time for other things and came no more '' it was then last week when i herd the song on a local radio station and it all came back to me , i had to see this movie again . memroys came running back from my childhood came running back . this is a great movie for all
1	i got what i ordered in a timely fashion , with no complaints . thank you
1	okay , so we all know the story about how the ducks come from behind to win and how coach bombay gets revenge on his old coach for many years of bad memories . fair enough . as corny and as thin as the plot can be at times , it 's still a great story with good morals . it 's definitely no hoosiers or rudy by a longshot , but it 's disney at it 's best . it 's a classic disney sports movie as well as a great family film . now , the dvd . let 's just say that i sure did n't buy this movie for the special features . there 's a menu screen with a chapter search and that 's about it . ohh , one more thing . whenever they re-released the film for dvd , i guess they must have inserted queen 's `` we are the champions '' and `` we will rock you '' into portions of the film and at the end credits . one thing in particular that kinda bugged me is that fact that the original score by david newman is replaced by queen 's `` we are the champions '' right at the part where charlie scores the winning penalty shot . it 's not that queen 's song would n't be fitting here . i just felt that the original score added a lot of emotion within the film . not a huge deal . i just did n't remember that the last time i saw the movie on vhs . ahh well . i guess for $ 8 i really ca n't complain
0	this video has some very effective routines , but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form . because they are done so fast , injuries can incur . she starts out slowly but quickly go into , what she calls , super sets . i have several videos , and that is definitely not the proper way to super set . normally , you could modify the moves by performing them slower , but , because they are time crunch workouts ( about 10 minutes each segment ) , you really do n't have the time to do that . definitely , not one of her better videos . the routines are easy , but because of the improper form used , not recommended for the beginner , as it could do my damage then good . if you are a denise austin fan ( even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos , she 's still a great instructor ) , try one of her hit the spot segments .
1	take a brief look at the lives of some jewish hungarians during ww2 in auschwitz concentration camp . i do n't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through . watching thousands of your friends , families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in . it just goes beyond anything i can fathom . these people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into . would i make the same choices they had ? would it be worth living one more day , doing what they had to do ? i do n't know , and i do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions . i do know this movie does an excellent job of showing how is might of been for those poor souls
1	yes , this film feels like a diatribe . it 's probably less factual than the film version of john dillinger 's exploits that director john milius made in the seventies . so why do i recommend this film over milius ' more polished account ? well , this film in a campy , over-the-top way is just so entertaining . secondly , lawrence tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence . his tough ferocity keeps the film 's campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality . there 's also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans marc lawrence and elisha cook jr. ( seems like he 's in all these noir-gangster flicks ) on hand . the story is told here crisply and in an economical 70 minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there 's worse ways to do it . oh , john , if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks !
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
1	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best . when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window . i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays
0	this item is supposedly titled `` ufos : the first encounters . '' it is , however , an episode about reincarnation . it is incorrectly labeled . do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation
0	man , i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking , but it should be illegal ! this is , first off , a terrible dvd : 4:3 ( full screen ) format , with a dark , muddy picture . worse , the plot is typical , predictable , and poorly written . other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body , sitting through this fiasco is a total bore . i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie , since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this . that is probably the fault of the director , erik anjou , a third-rate director ( at best ! ) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary . gee , i wonder why he is n't in more demand ( not ! ) ! i can enjoy `` b '' movies , and bad movies , but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at . i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity , and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger ( 29 year-old ) teri hatcher nude . rent this , if you must , but , wow , there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad
0	right off the bat , jj runs into an indian in the middle of nowhere , the indian has is gun jj doesnt , oh boy the tension fills the air , no wait , for the first time ever , the indian turns and rides away , does not kill the white man , who is all alone on the indians land , trying to catch his fish . liberal revisionist trying to make the indian look like he is better than the white man , and oh smarter also , for just after that , jj is trying to get a fire going `` but '' does this under a tree that has snow all over it , he gets the fire going and oh darn ! snow fell on it ! dumb white man ! if this movie didnt have superstar robert redford in it , would of been just another dumb movie , like that idiot timmy that made grizzly man . an indian that lets a white man live all out in the middle of nowhere , lol ! yes the white man stole the land , yes the white man did this that and everything else to the indians . but its not like they were angels , they fought with each other just like the rest of the world has always done throught history . to deny that , is just plain stupid . the 1970 's , marks the turning point the liberals took over hollyweird . clint eastwood never would of made this move in the 1960 's , or ever .
1	even though this cinderella does not have the modern day `` movie magic '' , ( in fact , the sets are pretty corny ) ... that does not hurt , or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl , and looked forward every year for the airing of `` cinderella '' and `` the wizard of oz '' i was thrilled to have found this , and would highly , highly recomend it to any 40+ woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella . leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this
1	the more historically accurate the film , the more it tends to drag . the molly maguires certainly passes this test ! still , it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong-headed response which brought them into conflict with the church
0	i bought this movie because i thought it would be like the movie version of louis l'amour 's `` conagher '' . unfortunately , it is a far cry from that movie . the quick and the dead was too predictable , the dialog was stilted and unrealistic , and the characters ... well , they were too much `` in character '' and not believable . i am curious how faithful the script was to the book . if the movie is as faithful to the book as `` conagher '' was , then i apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with mr. l'amour instead
1	this was the first disney movie i watched as a child . i would still watch it today . disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using `` friendly '' animals , while still keeping the main storylines intact . thumbs up to the music ; `` love goes on and on '' is a moving piece , and even hits my hard heart . parents with younger children be warned : some scenes may frighten them .
1	as an asian american , i just want to say how well this movie is made . i 'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors ( come on people , this was in the 1930s ! ! ) and yes , there are a few scenes that are not in the book . but , let 's count how many hollywood movies ( taken from books ) that ca n't hold a candle to it 's original masterpiece . i love the movie 'misery ' but if you 've read the book , the book outshines the movie by a landslide . so yes , the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book , but still a very well made movie nonetheless , particularly for the 1930s . i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd
1	eventually , anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories . first , you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter , and probing into the nature of evil . sometimes , they go the supernatural route ( the exorcist , rosemary 's baby , do n't look now ) . sometimes , they stay grounded ( psycho , henry : portrait of a serial killer , se7en ) . either way , they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening . you acknowledge that what you 've seen has struck a kind of nerve , but you wo n't lose much sleep . these movies are intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror . on the other hand , the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology , in the `` nature '' of their content , and do not attempt to intellectually engage you . they only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger . the movies that fall into this category ( halloween , alien ) do not provide food for thought , but they know how to make you uncomfortable , and they know how to push your buttons . they are manipulative in the extreme , but they are actively frightening , and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films can not . finally , the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves . they want to frighten you , but they also want to convince you that they are `` above '' merely pushing your buttons . at the same time , they do n't want to go the intellectual route either . these films ( scream , dawn of the dead ) are made by people who know the genre , know that the audience knows the genre , and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly . these films are very effective , even if they are too cool for the room . you laugh knowingly , and then , bam , something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face . bernard rose 's `` candyman '' is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories . it is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil , but it is also , truly , viscerally frightening . it is self-aware and yet , it is not too cool for the room , and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen . it is as immediately frightening as the orginal halloween , it is as thought-provoking as the exorcist , and it is as aware as itself as the scream trilogy . you 've never seen anything quite like it before , and you probably wo n't see anything like it again . the plot of candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine ; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force ( the cabrini green housing projects in chicago , which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation ) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the candyman , a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times . she is convinced , as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be , that the candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence . the fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the candyman reinforces this conviction . for this woman , the idea that there is evil in the world , pure evil , unconditioned by economic/racial ( most of the residents of cabrini green are poor and black ) factors is unthinkable . she does not believe that the candyman is anything more than an idea . she is wrong . the candyman is real , and he does n't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism . furthermore , she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with , and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one . for about half of the film , we follow the woman , played by virginia madsen , and her friend , played by kasi lemmons , as they trek through cabrini , exchange notes , and conduct the affairs of their lives . madsen 's grad student is no different from a lot of young people . she is determined to make a mark on her field , she 's a little suspicious about her husband 's fidelity , she smokes , she 's pretty , she 's intelligent and she seems nice enough . she draws our sympathy . however , midway through the film , there is a decisive rupture , and everything in madsen 's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate . the chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from . soon , everything we have come to know about the young woman we 've been following , all of the connections she has to her friends , to her husband , to humanity in general seem to be undone . it would be unfair to describe exactly what happens , but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of candyman are as frightening as anything i 've seen on film . we thought we were safe , after all . the character we 'd been following had friends , family , a job , a life of her own . the possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind ; she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects , more afraid of drug dealers than of demons . after all , the candyman is an urban legend , and we know all about urban legends . they 're campfire stories . there is no boogeyman , not really . rose plays on the self-conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us . he engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the candyman is literally real , or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him ( i 'll leave that up to you to decide ) . and he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment , and by never allowing us to regain our footing . it does n't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals ( the bees swallowing the chicago skyline , the candyman 's self-portrait ) , plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from philip glass ( whose presence reminds us that , hey , this is a serious piece of art ) and compelling performances on all levels . not to mention a great idea , and , yes , the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to . candyman is , as far as i 'm concerned , the second most frightening film ever made ; the original halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety . but i would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art -- no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on -- than rose 's masterpiece . halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings , as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what 's coming . candyman 's power remains undiminished , even once you get the sequence down , because the scares give way to the ideas . do n't miss it . rated r : contains some very graphic gore ( nothing that will really surprise those used to the genre , but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard -- seriously , who said this was n't gory enough ? ) some language , and brief nudity ( not in a sexual context )
1	i can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time i saw this movie . while i did n't understand it then , i found that the music and the scenery was breath taking . seeing this movie years later along with other great 's such as young bess and mary queen of scots , helena carter 's and cary elwes performance 's are right up there with such great names as stuart granger and jean simmons . i would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies , but like i said , do n't take into account that the history is a little jumbled , just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot .

1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	i bought this dvd for my kids because they love the story of goodnight moon , and the cost was too low to pass up . this video has exceded our expectations . the kids ask to watch it every night before bed . they love that there are other kids telling stories and talking about bedtime . in addition , there are several other well known stories , songs , lullabies , etc . this is definitely worth the money , and makes a great gift for toddlers
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	most l & amp ; h fans know that the boys made a long series of mgm/fox pictures which reflected the big studio `` assembly line '' film-making approach and the wartime atmosphere . students of film comedy understand how the `` traditional '' stan & amp ; ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard . however , it 's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go completely to waste , as it does in aaw - the presence of edgar kennedy should lift th proceedings ; instead it reinforces the melancholia . i found the drunken scene most distasteful . still , l & amp ; h followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been
1	my grandson loved the movie . i also like the pokemon series of movies .
0	a totally awesome movie when it was first released , hawaii is based on the james a. michener bestseller . even at three hours plus , it still had to leave a lot of michener 's novel untouched , but the basic idea is still there . the breathtaking cinematography adds to it , as does an outstanding elmer bernstein score . then there 's the acting by the stars , max von sydow as the missionary who goes to hawaii to preach to the natives , and brings his own brand of religion with him . julie anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife . richard harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher 's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend . the supporting characters are just as memoriable , with an actual islander playing the queen , and also an unknown playing keoki . all in all , take hawaii complete , or do n't take it at all . wait until the complete version comes out on dvd . i rated it one star because of the cuts , but it is a five-star movie in its complete version
0	a number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible . honestly , i was not impressed . the plot is disjointed and confusing ; jumping from the north african theatre to the european theatre almost seamlessly , leaving the viewer thoroughly confused . the character development is also very poor . no one character stands out due to the fact that samuel fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue . historically speaking this film is a joke . during the action scenes when the germans have tanks they are in fact american tanks with the german symbol painted on . also , uniforms are sometimes inaccurate . however , the most annoying aspect is the fact that samuel fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the only squad fighting the entire war . only once or twice do you see any other american troops . this feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war , of which these men are supposed to be a part of . finally , to make matters worse , the film 's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical , sloppy , awkwardly placed , and consist of ridiculous situations . overall this movie was too long , lacked character development for most of the movies characters , was disjointed , and was historically inaccurate . for a movie that garnered so much hype i was expecting much , much more .
1	background : the 1976 cel animated real sequel to frosty the snowman , it is shorter than the original frosty at half an hour format . made 7 years after the original frosty which was an hour long format . the character design was by paul coker jr , who did the same work for the first special , so the visual continuity works very well . frosty gets a wife named crystal ( played by shelley winters ) . while the first show was narrated and sung by jimmy durante , this time we have the voice talents of andy griffith . the famous voice actor paul frees stars as jack frost , and the policeman . frees was a regular at the studio and had voiced the policeman , ticket seller , and santa in the original . dennis day voiced the parson , and jackie vernon voiced frosty just like he did in the original . the writer is romeo muller , just like the original and maury laws returned as the musical director . there are no original songs this time out , as christmas standards are used instead . oh , there is another film out there called `` frosty returns '' that is marketed as a sequel to the original frosty , but it is made by another studio . it features the voices of johnathon winters and john goodman , it 's fun but not up to the quality of this show . plot : just like the song says , frosty comes back again someday . frosty returns to play with the children , but jack frost is envious of him . he tries to steal frosty 's magic hat . the children build frosty a wife named crystal according to magic instructions from frosty . when jack frost finally gets frosty , its his wife that must save him with love . they finally make friends and work together to have a long happy winter . very well done by rankin/bass studio . their studio has brought us such memorable holiday classics such as rudolph the red-nosed reindeer , year without a santa claus , nestor the long-eared christmas donkey , mad monster party , the little drummer boy , frosty the snowman , santa claus is coming to town , mouse on the mayflower , here comes peter cottontail , cricket on the hearth , the stingiest man in town , jack frost , pinnochio 's christmas , rudolph 's shiny new year , the first easter bunny . they also made non-holiday films such as the hobbit , flight of dragons , the last unicorn . it is incredible that one company is responsible for all those tv specials , 95 % of the ones we see every year . their work includes standard animation , stop-motion animagic , and live action . i hope this comes out on a restored dvd soon , i have bought all the other rankin/bass that have been released on dvd .
1	this is one of the great westerns : strong cast in every role , straighforward plot , glorious locale , and lots of hard riding and fast shooting . for fun , see it as the middle film in a trilogy of viet nam-related westerns . `` magnificent seven '' is first ( all ideology and victory assured ) , `` ulzana 's raid '' is third ( everybody 's burnt out and savage and nobody wins ) ; `` the professionals '' in the middle . a wicked , wealthy texan ( ralph bellamy in the same kind of hat lbj used to wear when he was on the ranch pretending to herd cattle ) hires a small band of highly skilled , experienced professionals ( think green berets ) to rescue his wife ( the viet namese peasants ) from the wicked jack palance ( the vc ) . they do the job , but it turns out the wife really loves her `` abductor '' and prefers him to the texan , so the professionals return her to her lover and her home , and , `` going native , '' go back with them . or you can skip all that and just enjoy the hell out of this fabulous movie
1	i enjoyed most of this movie and applaud its central message : that kids ( and people ) rise to meet expectations , and that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are not necessarily lacking in intelligence but only in resources and opportunities . however i found the movie not entirely satisfying because it does not really show just how jaime escalante turned these kids around , other than being creative , charismatic and persistent . as a former teacher myself of high school kids from a similar background as the ones portrayed in this movie , i know firsthand that what escalante achieved is not impossible but it 's not quite so clean and simple as shown here , but is extremely hard grueling work that often entails breaking through a lot of the students ' ingrained patterns and applying a lot of painstaking coercion . the director , ramon menendez , seems to present a fairly sanitized and glib version that glosses over a lot of the underlying social problems that are endemic to the urban poor while sometimes relying on some stock movie cliches ( the tough guy who 's really a softie at heart , the big seemingly dumb lunk , etc. ) . in short , `` stand and deliver '' lacks the kind of rawness , grit and ballsiness that could 've made it more than just another well-meaning , triumphant and feel-good movie . it could have been a movie that asks questions instead of spooning out pat answers . it 's too bad a real master like martin scorsese did not direct this one
0	i learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets . obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that does n't make my opinion any less valid . it is , after all , my honest opinion , and therefore it is worth something to someone , if only to me . sometimes i agree with ebert , and sometimes i completely disagree with him . i think we all believe in our hearts that `` i '' am the only one with the correct opinion . i would subscribe to that myself . this movie is painfully slow and boring . wim wenders , next time maybe you will develop a story line , please , huh ? i really hate the premise that the only way an angel 's life can be fulfilling is if he becomes human . that is the moral here and also in the annoying movie city of angels . that 's absurd . assuming that there is life after death , assuming that there are angels , and i in no way discount that possibility because i know how little we truly know , it is absurd to think that the angels have nothing to do but watch over us and wish they were with us . that is offensively stupid and self centered . it is like a child 's point of view that mommy and daddy have absolutely nothing to do and are bored to tears when they are not watching the baby and coloring in the baby 's coloring book . so this conception of angels is , in my not at all humble opinion , stupid and offensive . what makes you think that we humans are the center of the universe and the only worthwhile thing that is going on , dingbat ? stupid premise , and boring story , if you want to call it a story at all . i ca n't keep watching it . it is still on right now , and i 'm writing this review to relieve the boredom . later - after seeing the end of the movie , i must add that the final monologue committed by the angel 's human girlfriend is probably the worst monologue i have ever seen on film . she goes on and on , saying nothing , in a stupid and self indulgent elongated bit of nonsense that is surreal , meaningless , and stupid . the only thing that this movie has going for it is that it makes people appreciate simple things about life , like warming your hands together on a cold day . that 's a nice and worthwhile thought , to appreciate the very little and insignificant things about life . aside from that bit of wisdom , this movie is poor , boring , full of itself , aimless , and overrated
1	this is a masterpiece of cinema . after watching robert mulligan 's more famous ( to me ) movies : to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 , i found this jewel . i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is . directors like ford , hawks , lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone , and so is cinema as art , but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it , although it may only last a blink of an eye . i am off to check out `` come september '' now . who is this robert mulligan , anyway ? lovable little gem
1	with c.i . already except for peter artinian , the father of heather since 2003 and they have moved back to long island after 1 year in maryland deaf community . all of the kids are probably mainstreamed instead of institutionalized in a residential school for the deaf . this happened after 3 yrs of watching the trends and etc . this documentary is excellent insight into turmoil between ci and culturally deaf community . nina and others appeared on abc good morning america in 4/2003 i also hear that josh aronson has released a follow up video of sound and fury . anyway , this sound and fury video is a must see
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 , it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story . wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download ! ! !
1	lot 's of skiing , women that were hot in the nineties , and a little bit of cheese combine to make this the best drama of all time for skiiers . this movie teaches essential survival skills like exactly how to handle a french jackass ski-instructor if he ever blames you for stealing his heli-ski clients . what you do is offer to split the tip with them , then when he says with his french accent , `` i don wan to split de tip '' , just slam your ski locker in his face and come up with an extremly witty comment , then call him an azzhole as you walk away ... ..brilliant ! ! also , what do you do when you 've been invited up to the mansion of a european lady with enormous teeth and you search the whole house for her , only to find her her in the indoor swimming pool wearing nothing but the fur under her arms ? when she asks if you swim you answer , `` like a fish '' and whatever you do do n't take your clothes off . this would take too much time . just kick off your high-tops that are n't laced at the top and dive in . when you come to the surface of the water , the hair flip to get water out of your face must be perfect or she may not invite you to stay the night . perfect ! ! i look at aspen extreme more as an instructional video for these situations . thanks tj dex , because of you i now live in my van and life is sweet . i 'm kidding about all of this but it still is my favorite ski flick for sure .
0	should n't a `` masterpiece '' of comedy be ... i do n't know ... funny
0	shawn hatosy ( the faculty , outside providence ) is in love with rachael leigh cook ( she 's all that , antitrust ) but she doesnt love him , she only wants to be his friend , then enter hatosy 's friend , jonathan rhys-meyers ( tv 's elvis , velvet goldmine ) who becomes cook 's boyfriend and hatosy becomes jealous from this ... .who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love ... .you know what , who cares really . hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop lorraine bracco ( the sopranos , medicine man ) . this boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me . cook is really stale , hatosy , as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers . worth a look and by god im not looking again and towards the end you 're like ... .why i did i rent this ? ! ! . also starring estella warren ( planet of the apes remake ) .
0	the dynamic root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children 's comedy . my advice to root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash . the only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child curtis . big props to my man for his preformance . hope to see you in more movies to come . p.s . i think taylor root is still a virgin
0	people were talking about this movie as if it were the next silence of the lambs . there are several reasons why this is not so . 1 . the dumbest cop in the world : this character never calls for backup , and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues . at the end , he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight . he 'd never survive on the sopranos . 2 . it 's sooooooo 1998 . this movie assumes you know nothing about the internet . 3 . it tries to be cool by combining bdsm , body modification , and rituals , but in the end it just makes all these things look bad . 4 . it 's inconsistent . the dee snider character `` retires '' all his piercings for a few years , and then suddenly they 're all back in the next scene . 5 . it 's unrealistic . where the heck did snider get that second dungeon from in just a day ? 6 . i wo n't even get into the gaping plot holes . the acting , pretty bad . the dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood : grumpy . amy smart is totally wasted in this movie . snider 's pretty good though . actually he 's really good . really , bottom line : you have only two reasons to buy this movie . 1 . you are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a twisted sister tour bus through them with room to spare . 2 . you 're a snider fan and you must own this . if you belong to one of those two groups , go for it . for sister fans , they 'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song captain howdy/street justice . you 've been warned !
1	there used to be a tv show of the baby-sitter 's club and i loved it . it used to air on the disney channel . when disney was n't pathetic as a ballon back then . but the film was great ... i remember the times when i used to read the books . their classic books for kids . but the movie is awesome . the girls played to their characters wonderfully . in the movie christy was my favorite , the girl who played her , anyway . i like the scene when christy went to the fair and her dad did n't show up . to me that was mean . then she was walking in the rain . the rest of bsc showed up . it all became a happy ending , which was good . i ca n't wait to get it on dvd .
0	this recording is simply defective . it opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording , and boy , they are not kidding ! this is not a simple case of vhs quality on a dvd . instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing . and the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders , complete with pitch shifts.. it is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording . even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame . some example frames at vienneseball dot org slash pirates this is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance . i am immediately returning this to amazon . this recording should never have been released

1	i rented the movie and i hav n't seen the first three but this one was pretty good . it was n't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie , good plots and story line . i do n't recommend going out and buying it righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself
1	this dvd brings me back to when i was growing up in the 70 's . i am happy to share this with my kids . who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or rosie greer singing `` it 's alright to cry . '' one of the highlights is the duet by roberta flack and a young michael jackson singing `` you do n't have to change at all . '' i am so happy i am able to have this piece of my childhood to share .
0	the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies . leslie cheung is a fantastic actor , and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express . so , even though i do n't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies , i still decided to watch this movie . i was extremely disappointed . the cinematography is boring and poorly done . the plot is juvenile . it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys . i hated the movie . however , i fully understand that many , many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made .
0	i 'm sorry , but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film `` dick . '' `` dick '' is funny , this is not . i 'm sorry , but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst ( or that level of indefatigable cuteness ) . just go rent `` dick '' instead . you 'll thank me , yourself , and those fine ladies who saved our country

1	stargate atlantis is great . i like the idea of downloading the episodes , but put in all the seasons . why leave out season 2 ?
1	it is easy to see why jane wyman , with her limpid eyes and winsome smile , won an academy award as a deaf-mute in this adaptation of the play `` johnny belinda . '' the academy is known for succumbing to characters with mental or physical afflictions ( `` the snake pit , '' `` rain man , '' etc . ) when she kneels beside the body of her father ( charles bickford ) and signs the lord 's prayer , her oscar was a secret even price-waterhouse could n't keep . the temptation to cynicism , however , is unwise . the picture turns out to be quite affecting . wyman and lew ayres , as the doctor who teaches her to communicate , do some of their best work in `` johnny belinda . '' after the town bully ( stephen mcnally ) rapes belinda , he and his wife ( jan sterling ) attempt to adopt the son ( named johnny ) belinda has by him . director jean negulesco ignores the soap operatics and creates a rugged sense of place , an insular nova scotia seaside farming village . the black-and-white cinematography is invaluable here . the supporting cast is fine , and there are memorable touches everywhere . in addition to wyman 's prayer for her father , there 's bickford 's pride in his blossoming daughter , and her responses to life 's vicissitudes . agnes moorehead is the tart-tongued but quietly sympathetic aunt . and sterling , in her first major role , does not disappoint . what does disappoint is the perfunctory dvd release warner bros. has given the studio 's own movie , a big hit with audiences in 1948 .
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
0	in the short story collection night shift , mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of ( this mess , trucks ( twice once by king as `` maximam overdrive '' and once as a t.v . movie ) , night surf , the boogyman ( not the new one ) , graveyard shift , the mangler , and maybe more and not one has been done right ! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve `` he who walks behind the rows '' more like `` we steped in something behind the rows '' and we steped in this flameing piece of junk ! ! ! skip it ! ! ! ! ! !
1	one of the first of the great ealing comedies , and a clear indication that their comedies would carry social and political weight as well . in this picture a run-down section of london discovers a horde of burried treasure when a bomb left over from ww ii explodes accidentally , and the residents of pimlico , london , learn that they actually are a part of burgandy , as deeded by the king in the 1400s . this means they are a separate country right in the heart of london , and they decide to act like a separate country . thus they conclude that the laws of england do n't apply anymore - but likewise england cuts them off , and pimlico is under siege . the craziness of the situation leapfrogs , with passports now required , services cut , people throwing food over the barbed-wire fence to help them survive . it 's a great satire on government and sovereignty . it 's also an interesting look at post-war london , with its burned-out buildings still plentiful and ration books still in use ( england felt very much at the short end of the stick after the war , the last of the allied countries to be under wartime restrictions and shortages ) . the script is terrific ( typical for ealing productions ) , and stanley holloway is wonderful as the leader of pimlico . definitely worth a watch
0	i thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot . also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable
0	as i recall , 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and point blank , in my opinion , would be one of the worst films i have ever watched . notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film , the acting by such notables as lee marvin , carroll o'conner and angie dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis-jointed and nonsensical dialogue . flashbacks , san quentin , the san francisco skyline can not save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history . if your a lee marvin fan , better to watch `` the man who shot libery valance '' twice , than waste your time on point blank . your disposition will be better for it
1	heh ! i 'm joking . everybody has a right to an opinion . turns out this film has held up well . i 'd seen it in the 80s and have always wanted to give it another go . the material , involving a young naturalist leaving his family and big city life behind to live in the canadian countryside , is most appealing to me . i imagine it would n't be the most desirable plan to kids of today ; but you never know . i 'll admit the young actor his bares a striking resembance to the `` home alone '' actor , but not so much as the cover suggests . i mean , he does n't exactly make friends with the bear either . just an attempt to sell it to kids . anyway , i thoroughly enjoyed seeing this film again and was quite happy with the image quality . well done paramount !
0	rule number one if you 're making a stephen king movie , especially if it 's a tv movie ; make it scary or do n't make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film , you 're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions . granted , that 's all in the book , but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it . there are some exciting alien moments at the end , but by then it 's too late . you 've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x-files episode . on the plus side , i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her
0	even though i am not a sophia loren fan , i thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these 3 different short stories about 3 totally different women . anyone born before 1940 should enjoy them as well
1	this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday . she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet . i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors . i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now . impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing .
1	the dylan ( ? ) lyric `` to laugh and cry in a single sound '' came to mind the first time i saw this movie as part of a saturday night film series at the local university 25 years ago -- it 's just brilliant , a wild and manic ride that ends up being completely life-affirming , you just want to cry out at the end of the movie , it 's too good to be true . this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
1	i urge everyone out there to download this episode ! this one totally rocks ! shep , a wraith and kolya all in one episode ! any episode with shep ( joe flannigan ) and kolya are well worth watching ! download this and download every other stargate sg1 and stargate atlantis episode !
1	jacques tati wrote , directed , and starred in this satire of modern gadgetry . he visits his sister 's house , which occupies a definite spot in one of the circles of dante 's hell : the furniture is ugly and useless , the kitchen sounds like the insides of an auto repair shop , all the `` modern '' conveniences are eyesores and demonic . the movie consists of mostly all sight gags , some funny , others not . tati is the french chaplin : there 's very little dialogue , he wears a set costume ( raincoat and pipe ) , there are lots of weird background noises and pratfalls . there 's a lot of subtlety here , too , ( it 's not the three stooges by a longshot ) , and a lot of care went into the little things - all of them visual , of course ( tati does n't speak at all ) . but it can fall flat at times , and it does go on too long . it 's a very clever idea , though
1	when con man and general loser eric stanton ( dana andrews ) drifts into the small california ocean-side town of walton late one night , he has dollar in his pocket and few prospects . stanton wanders into the only diner open , pops , to get a cup of coffee and something to eat . he meets mr. judd ( charles bickford ) , a retired new york cop , and the waitress , stella ( linda darnell ) . stanton soon finds himself up to his eyes in three things he did n't expect . he did n't expect to fall for stella , a sullen beauty who is prepared to sell what men want for a wedding ring and a good life . he did n't expect to find himself on the run for stella 's murder ... with a wife , june mills ( alice faye ) , a woman he married for her money so that he and stella could eventually be together . not only are the walton cops after him , they 've signed up judd to help out , a smart , tough man who does n't hesitate to punch up a suspect if that 's what he thinks is needed . and stanton sure did n't expect to ever find himself in a situation he could n't talk himself out of . the one thing that struck me about this movie is how much of a hole in the center alice faye leaves . her june mills is so bland and vanilla that her character is just not very interesting . she loves stanton , she 's loyal , she 's convinced not only that stanton is innocent , but that he has the ability to change his life into something worthwhile . in other words , june mills is so noble she 's boring . this may be the way the part was written , but faye does n't seem to have the acting ability to add some edge around the words . having to compete with linda darnell 's lush sullenness was beyond faye 's abilities . it would have been interesting , for instance , to see ann sheridan as june mills , speaking the same lines . that leaves the three main characters who , for me , were hard to feel much for : stella , who 'll take you to the cleaners before she 'll take you to bed ; june , who 'll probably want to pray with you every night before you climb into bed ; and eric stanton , a weak con man who often gets caught up in his own cons . one other weakness for me is that it is easy to spot the killer , but his comeuppance only came about in a fast last three minutes of the movie . the reason for the killing is nice and tawdry , but i wish that we 'd had one or two strong red herrings to chew on . there were a lot of possible candidates but they were left floating alone by themselves . i liked the way the small town of walton looked and was photographed , tidy and boring . the opening of the movie -- the state highway speeding by at night with the credits appearing as signs -- was nicely atmospheric . stanton 's conning of june into having her fall for him was great . the screenwriter hit just the right notes of sincerity , friendliness and charm , all of which was a little too practiced . it was fun watching stanton in action . he thinks of himself as able to talk anyone into anything . dana andrews and the lines he says make it believable . one of the strengths of the movie now is the range of fine character actors who show up . to name a few , in addition to bickford , there 's john carradine , percy kilbride , bruce cabot , jimmy conlin and olin howland . you may not recognize all the names , but if you 're fond of old movies you 'll recognize the faces . and anne revere does a fine job as clara , june mills ' older and protective sister . revere was a plain looking , raw-boned woman and a first-rate actress . she was one of many whose film careers were destroyed in the hollywood witch-hunts of the late forties and fifties . fallen angel is a minor noir , but worth a look . the dvd presentation is just fine . there are a couple of minor extras , and a commentary by eddie muller , described as a noted film noir historian , and dana andrews daughter , susan andrews . i did n't listen to it . the case contains a small , four-page booklet that gives insights into the movie
1	mata hari arrived in paris and soon began to spin a web of sorcery . her naked body ( that same body that was later to be riddled with bullets ) her password to a greedy world of material success.margaretha geertruida zelle macleod enjoyed a happy childhood in holland the darling of a dotting father . early restlessness brought her to java , the mail-bride of a brute . there , in indonesia , amid crushing tragedy and spousal abuse , gertie absorbed the artistic concepts that will one day found her applauded , then , mowed down by a french firing squad . poor judgment , and eastern flair , and a gluttony for men , contrived to make her eternal . but was gertie a spy ? the visionary irving thalberg secured the rights to mata hari 's notebooks and thus mgm began production starring greta garbo . i find this 1932 film a work of contrasts . to watch garbo mise-en-scene through the lens of william daniels , in a genial atmosphere assembled by cedric gibbons , rapturous , is truly a fine thing . mgm 's 'mata hari ' remains a unique accomplishment . though one wonders how the silly story-theme ever passed thalberg . there is a dichotomy here , style versus substance ( a chronic blemish with some of garbo 's films ) the developing narrative is puerile , and mind you , the early thirties boasts many a gritty film . more than an actress garbo is a virtuosa , a poseur . thus she offers art more priceless , a curious and singular spiritual apogee , such pulchritude and distinction . watch her shoulders ache suddenly as she plays piano en-scene , as her stock-in-trade matinee idol grasps her from behind wantonly . watch her match wits with lewis stone , tonight her spy-master . watch garbo in the third act climb the hospital stairs adrian head-to-toe . watch her watch her . but ! if i hear ramon navarro one more time call her `` ... mata ! '' i think i 'd croak ( her name is m-a-t-a-h-a-r-i ) how many times i 've seen 'mata hari ' i 'm ashamed to say . the last viewings have been in the wee hours where there reigns a sad and profound solitude . on cue greta emerges , like cybele , to temporarily soothe my ills . soon , i hear a halting viola : `` ... i come to you si-va ! like the bayaderes dance in your sacred temples in java ... !

1	the night of the twisters is a very good movie , even for all ages . my mom and dad liked it , my kids liked it and , my wife and i liked it . it has many turns and twists , and is unperdictable like a tornado . this movie has plenty of suspence and has tons of action . this was a remarkable movie and that 's why i give it 5 stars
1	i enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series . enterprise started before i had my pvr and was either on at a time i was unable to watch it or i never made time . i watched one episode of star trek the next generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some star trek episodes again . rather than watch episodes i 've already seen , enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy star trek episodes . as far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews , if you 're paranoid , the internet is n't for you . keep your private things private , and not on networked computers . hopefully amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to
1	***** i liked this film a lot . it was entertaining , suspenseful , and made me think . it 's staying with me and i 'm continuing to think about it . `` a simple plan '' asks the question , `` what if you found $ 4.4 million in a gym bag in the woods ... would you keep it ... what if you thought there was a reasonably good chance you 'd never get caught ... that no one would ever know ? '' this is what happens to the central characters . the dvd cover advertises , `` sometimes good people do evil things . '' once they make their decision , and plan their plan , the movie illustrates how consequences happen that are completely unanticipated . bill paxton plays the main character and is wonderful as a typical `` good '' middle-class accountant in a small rural town . bridget fonda does an excellent job as his wife , who is very idealistic and moralistic until she realizes that the scenario is not hypothetical -- -in fact , she has to decide what to do , and she makes decisions different from what i would have expected . billy bob thornton is predictably great , of course , playing a rural man ( the main character 's brother ) who has never had a chance in the town he lives in and just wants to truly have a life , and in his own way , do what is right ; he is handicapped , however , by his intelligence , his eccentricity , and his background . i felt a lot of sympathy for his character , and since i 'm a person more like his brother , it was fascinating to see how he lived and thought ... as the movie progressed , his middle-class brother gained empathy for the difficult life he led , too . i did n't think that any of the pacing was slow , as other reviewers have said . i thought that the starkness and the pacing fit in beautifully with the movie and it gave me a chance to process what was going on . one moral decision led to another , and each of them made me think `` would i do that ? '' and `` could i do that ? '' it made me see how seductive certain crimes in certain circumstances can be to any one of us . this is a quality , very suspenseful , provocative film . i think it would be equally enjoyable for men and women but definitely not for children at all , as the themes are very heavy and mature . there are no special features or subtitles . i generally like subtitles , but they are not necessary in this film for hearing people , as everyone speaks very clearly . i can not imagine how anyone would dislike this movie . there is some violence , but none of it is gratuitous . i generally really dislike violence in movies , but it was worth it for the experience i took away after watching it . *****
1	lawn dogs is a surprisingly original and exceptionally well done independent film . mischa barton as devon is amazing . her face is pliable and ultra expressive , and even though she 's the strangest little 10 year old captured on film , her adult mannerisms and dialogue show us a little girl who has been treated like a china doll by her parents ; she 's had a rough life and heart problems , which she explains with a dippety dit , etc . she wants to show that she is still a person and quite capable of doing the things her parents are trying to spare her from . sam rockwell is equally effective as the `` poor white trash '' who mows the rich people 's lawns , a put upon young man , surprised at his friendship with this odd little girl . when watching the film , though , watch the subtle portraits that are painted : when devon wants to give trent a glass of water , she reaches for one of the better glasses whereupon her mother tells her there 's a glass for him under the sink -- -when trent takes devon to meet his parents , the mother offers them iced tea -- in her best glasses ; when trent interrupts a barbecue at devon 's house , daddy offers him a couple hot dogs while the rest of the guests are eating steak and baked potatoes ; when the community 's fancy lantern shades are being stolen , they blame trent , when it 's really the nasty little boy who 's doing this ; when cds are stolen from the golden boys ' car , it 's trent who is blamed , when again , it 's our little cowboy/indian/monster . the supporting performances are very good : kathleen quinlan , as devon 's mom , who is messing around with one of the golden boys ; christopher mcdonald as her dad , lost in the political workings of the development ; eric mabius as one of the golden boys obviously interested in rockwell 's body as well . there 's no real dramatic big scenes and it 's a leisurely film , but barton and rockwell are remarkable and the movie has a sense of realism to counteract the fantasy elements
0	while there has never been a completely factual account of the life of wyatt earp ( `` tombstone '' comes the closest ) , this film is completely fictional . first , wyatt is n't even married in this version , and he becomes enamored with a woman named clementine ; thus the title . doc holliday was a dentist , but in this film , he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves . as a piece of western fiction , this film would be alright , but since it was decided to use the names wyatt earp , doc holliday and the ok corral , the entire project is distracting . the only accurate facts in this film , are that there was a wyatt earp , a doc holliday and an ok corral . if it was n't for the excellent performances of henry fonda , and especially , walter brennen , i would have given this film one star
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman 's classic `` the virgin spring '' and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired , `` last house on the left '' by wes craven . they share identical plots , feature graphic rape scenes , and before it 's all over turn average men into murderers . and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961 's oscar-winning best foreign film -- and the other appreciated only in underground circles , but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation . so just how different are they ? not as different as you might imagine -- but as different as art and exploitation . `` the virgin spring '' is easily one of bergman 's most accessible films . telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion , he exposes a frankness and brutality people were n't accustomed to seeing . a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy . though they initially seem helpful , their actions quickly become violent . after a graphic ( for the time ) rape , the girl is murdered . later , the wrongdoers happen upon the girl 's home and seek shelter from her family -- both groups unaware of who the other is . suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought . it is a powerful tale of love , loss and the depths people can be driven into -- where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code , where savagery and rage take over . bergman 's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father . real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen . add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it 's a winning combination . but what endures in the story of `` the virgin spring '' is how strong a component faith becomes -- when there is nothing left to believe in , can you still believe ? a classic in every sense , `` the virgin spring '' still has the power to shock but there 's something very redemptive about the film . `` last house on the left , '' however , is probably more notorious than acclaimed . the plot , as i 've said , is identical . coming 12 years later , in 1972 , wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale . it is a shocker , and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the `` torture cinema '' of today . it is brutal , uncompromising and graphic -- and the film was championed in the underground horror market . working with a small budget , the film lacks the artistry of `` the virgin spring . '' while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock -- what it lacks is depth and subtlety . the characters are n't particularly drawn out so their actions do n't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film . without contemplating faith and moral choices , what we 're left with is straightforward revenge . and the film , ultimately , has no redemption -- no uplift . it 's violence for the sake of violence . it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it 's own right . and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation . kgharris , 11/06
1	when worlds collide has all the ingredients of a great movie for the year that it was made . the actors were great . the story is scary when you start to think that this can happen . the ending was excellent . not a happy ending for mother earth but not all end of the world movies should have the earth been saved . i bought the movie and seeing it many time and still like it .
0	the movie is frustrating and a big disappointment . and , what is the point of everything being so white ? is there some deep meaning here or something ? this movie is exasperating
1	this episode is a bit different than the others i have seen , although i have not yet seen all of season 2 yet . without giving anything away , this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings . additionally , it has some inventive guest characters . finally , it presents some moral and ethical questions
0	this romantic comedy was charming , funny , and clever . i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents . ( if you do , try it with captions ) . it was fun , funny , and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift
0	update : i think i 've figured out why they 've made the changes which take away much of the magick that is riverdance . the people i work with know how crazy i am about all things celtic . so , bless 'em , they thought i would like michael flatley 's latest creation , celtic tiger , and got me that for my holiday gift this year . after watching that hideously tacky travesty of a show , it seems like whoever is in charge of rd these days is trying to compete with sacred meets vegas and vegas wins junk that mr. flatley has produced ! so , come on , take rd back to it 's magickal , lovely , sacred roots ! what are they thinking ? who changed the number that originally featured davey spillane playing the pipes ? why on earth would anyone want to take one of the most soul-hauntingly lovely pieces of sacred musick ever written amd make subtle alterations to it ? and the sound quality of the tape leaves a lot to be desired ! as always , the performers are awesome ! and i 've gotten over the trauma of knowing that i 'll never get to see michael and jean live ! just kidding about the trauma part , however the rd of my dreams definietely has those two in the lead roles ! but come on , a lugh with black hair ! the best lugh i 've actually seen live was patrick roddy . the best brigit i 've seen live is eileen martin . the last time i saw rd live was about a year ago , and this was the version that i saw and it kind of made me think that rd was trying to go hollywood ! however , there were a few good things about the changes . the narration about how it 's all a journey from one lifetime to the next and the inclusion of the shivna number ! it 's quite good ! i would n't realy advise buying this tape unless you are a rd nut like i am and buy anything about rd that you can get your hands on !
1	this is one of those groundbreaking films that that put the whammy on a genre ; in this case , the western can never come back . oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong , loving their horses , and ignoring the school marm . robert altman , a political and cultural man of the 1960 's left simply says `` horse feathers . '' the hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner . the school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types do n't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism . the town , near vancouver , canada sits in a mountains and wilderness . the film company built the town . that 's real snow there folks and blizzards as our anti-hero beatty shoots it out with the company men while his best `` girl '' julie christy hides out in an opium den , her brown eyes realistically glassy . john wayne 's , the searchers was one of the best films ever made . mccabe mrs. miller tries to undo all that . fascinating look at the underbelly of frontier life and a forerunner of the hbo series deadwood , the west may not be a better place for it .
0	director : jamie blanks cast : denise richards , david broeanaz , marley shelton , jessica capshaw , jessica cauffiel , katherine heigl , hedy burress , fulvio cecere . running time : 96 minutes rated r for strong horror violence , some sexuality and language . `` valentine '' , the over-slasherized version of the excellent tom savage suspense novel , starts with a pre-teen valentine disco set in 1988 . a bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with . first he approaches shelly ( later played by katherine heigl ) who embarrassingly rebuffs him . his charm does n't seem to work with lilly ( jessica cauffer ) , paige ( denise richards ) or kate ( marley shelton ) either ; they all send him packing quite arrogantly . his luck changes when dorothy ( jessica capshaw ) actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand . they are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies . in order to save her own self from persecution , dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge . they cover him in red gooey stuff ( `` carrie '' anyone ? ) , strip him , and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up . fast forward ten years and the girls are now women ; no one is sure what happened to jeremy ( the bullied brat from earlier ) as he disappeared after that dance . it 's close to valentine 's day ( of course ) and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives . they soon realize to take them seriously when shelly is found with her throat sliced . before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving kate and her boyfriend adam ( david boreanaz ) to work out that she 's next on the psycho 's list . the acting is standard horror fare . denise richards once again shows us her amazing and wide-range acting talents : those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call `` breasts . '' david boreanaz gives a fair performance , but definitely should n't give up his day job on the wb 's `` angel . '' newcomer marley shelton ca n't do much with her underwritten role , and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part . the rest of the acting is close to pitiful . another problem with valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it 's almost impossibility for them to win over the audience . in the beginning they 're shown as mockers to any child that 's unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain . this discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date , simply because they 're not up to their high standards . how can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive ? in a typical slasher movie , the `final girl ' is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards , like laurie strode . these characters have no such power , leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway . director jamie banks ( `` urban legend '' ) has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker ; however this is his first feature failure . it 's a shame that he could n't have made more of the talented cast and competent budget , but in the end , valentine just feels empty . a couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones . cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart . this one 's destined to escape our memories in the not-too-distant future
0	if you want erotica then this is n't the emanuelle film for you . yes , there are a couple of so-so love scenes , but the one lesbian scene is pratically non-existent , and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content . i expected more erotic content , and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that i did n't particularly expect . remember that scene in `` tarzan the ape man '' where a nude bo derek was tied up and bathed by native women ? that scene was erotic . nothing like that one this video
1	when this movie came out and i saw it at the movietheater -- - you know the scene in the car where tine finally gets enough and hit him back ? everyone in the theater started yelling and screaming , clapping their hands ! ! it was awesome and i will never forget it !
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	the newly released double disc edition of `` the towering inferno '' , with its enhanced picture and sound , not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to 9/11 , cements its place in hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever
0	this movies rates right up there with `` schindler 's list '' . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda . fortunately , ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making `` gettysburg , '' and the even better `` gods and generals . '' if you want to see a real , accurate depiction of the war for southern independence ( aka , the civil war ) , watch `` gods and generals '' or `` gone with the wind , '' and stay away from movie garbage like `` andersonville . '' also watch for the extended version dvd of `` gods and generals '' coming for the christmas season of 2005 .
1	this 1960 effort by famed hammer productions of london , england is one of their finest efforts , and the greatest werewolf film ever made . even by today 's standards , the make-up for the werewolf is eye-opening and well worth the wait to see . the movie is filled with underlying themes and for those who look , it may be filled with a number of messages that are not readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative . color photography , normally a strong suit in hammer films anyway , is among their very best . the performance by the young oliver reed as the werewolf is filled with energy and passion . a highlight of director terence fisher 's accomplished career . if you only can have one werewolf film , this is the one
0	i 'm a big mann fan , and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films , thunder bay for instance . a great director , but this one stinks . i ca n't even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i
0	this is the worst movie that was ever made . i 'd rather move to paris and hang out in cafes debating french politics than watch this movie again . it is so bad that it 's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity -- it is disappointing from every angle . in this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film . i ca n't even force myself to describe the movie , it 's not worth the effort . i do n't like thinking about the movie as i write this . what i 'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie . are they nuts , or just the products of our modern , mindless universities ? someone needs to tell them it 's time for their medicine and to stay off the internet
1	i love anakin skywalk
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	dear quentin , how are things going , man ? i heard about the new film with uma . sounds great . did you see my newest film `` lucky numbers '' ? i play russ richards , the local celebrity weatherman in harrisburg , pennsylvania . russ has adoring fans , his own table and omelet at denny 's , and a snowmobile dealership . due to uncommonly warm weather , his dealership is about to go under , crumbling his entire financial empire . out of desperation , he pays a visit to gig ( tim roth ) , the owner of the local strip club . gig suggests that russ and his `friend ' crystal ( lisa kudrow ) rig the state lottery . crystal works at the same station and pulls the numbers out for the lottery . crystal is all for the idea . she has also been dating dick simmons ( ed o'neil ) , the station manager and he has been neglecting her . her share of the winnings will help her break free . everything , of course , gets complicated . funny , huh ? it has it 's moments . quentin , you know that i like to work with people i know . it makes me feel comfortable . acting is hard , man . i need comfort to help me create my characters . nora ephron directed the film . she and i worked together on `` michael '' , which was pretty successful , so i was hoping lightning would strike twice . i really enjoyed reading the screenplay . basically it combines elements of dark comedy and farce . people act weird , some people die , people are mean to one another . but they also act really silly . i have n't done a lot of farce but i laughed when i read the screenplay . my track record with comedy is spotty , but if someone has the $ 20 million and a decent script , i 'm game . lisa and i are great together . she plays someone that is very different from her well-known persona on `friends ' . crystal is very different from phoebe . crystal has an edge , a determination that makes her very interesting . crystal has a few moments that also make her seem real , a very important factor in a farce . if the character does n't have at least a tiny grounding in reality , the farce does n't work . lisa gets this and makes it work . i get it , too , and made it work during the scene in the denny 's ... in the scene in the snow mobile dealership ... in the scene at the television studio when they reveal that someone was killed ... in the ... well , i know i made it work somewhere . i 'm no film historian , but it works . the supporting characters are top notch . michael moore plays crystal 's dimwitted cousin . he is very funny . tim roth is good , but does n't have a lot of laughs . but that 's ok . he 's primarily a dramatic actor anyway . actors should play to their strengths . michael rappaport plays a local thug . he 's all over the place . hell , most of the supporting cast is all over the place . that 's ok , because this is a farce , right ? i know reviewers will pick up on the fact that everyone in the film is greedy , unlikable and they really do n't like each other . there is n't really anyone to care about . that 's ok . these characters are based on real people . they do n't need to be likable . they need to be funny . they are funny . are n't they ? sometimes ? yes . they have some funny moments . nora is a great director . she has a good hand at comedy , especially farce . every farce i have ever seen has too many laughs . you 're laughing when another joke happens . you ca n't keep track of it all . thankfully , nora has slowed everything down ... quite ... a ... bit . her pacing is glacial . but i like that . i have the ability to laugh at the jokes . quentin , i 'm just not sure . i 've had a string of dogs lately . i 'm not a good actor . i 'm a movie star . i am a persona that draws people into the movies . they should n't expect my performance to be subtle or even well-modulated . if i 'm playing a local celebrity weatherman , i 'm going to play it for all the smarminess i can . i 'm going to mug and grin at every character that recognizes me . i 'm going to wear the local fame on my sleeve and when things start to go wrong , i 'm going to shake , rub my head , run around in circles , really frustrated . i can play characters . but lately , people have n't been coming to the films . `` battlefield earth '' was a disaster , but to save face , i told some news people that i thought it was good and will make a sequel . i am a powerful star , a member of the $ 20 million dollar club . i ca n't go back to the under $ 10 million club . i just ca n't . quentin , you are the king of creating comeback vehicles . can you start thinking of another comeback vehicle for me ? i know you can . i think that i may need another comeback in a year or two . start watching the old videos , ok , pal ? for me , quentin ? thanks , buddy . john
0	what a crock of **** . the only good thing is that it still has the story with tommy and thats it , , , the kills suck , the plot sucks , acting really sucks , and damnit no jason
0	ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie , i was estatic . i marked the movie release date on my calander , got my tickets in advance , and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater . the movie was a huge dissapointment . while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book , i certainly was n't expecting that . while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie , i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book . the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth . i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie , it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears , despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times
1	seriously guys ... if this film says anything to you , then it is your duty to do something ... these young men were wrongfully imprisoned ... . im not saying you have to donate your college fund ... but atleast spread the word ... tell people about www.wm3.org tell people about wm3 awareness day ( july 23 ) .. go to events ... tell everyone you know about this cause ... . and while you are saying `` i do n't have time for this '' remember that what is 5 minutes to you , could help these boys have 5 minutes more of freedom ... . seriously , think about it
1	`` koyaanisqatsi '' took seven years to make , from 1975 to 1982 . there is not a narration to tell you what to think . this is an art film , in my opinion , the value is up to the viewer : is this film meaningful ? does it have value ? as a viewer i say yes . this film is a fusion of music and image . in koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another . the `` grid '' is a polyrhythmic piece of music . there are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once , and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen . about 350,000 feet of film was shot . there definitely was a method to this madness : after the explosion of the grid , these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began : a rocket ship taking off . godfrey reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film . what does this film mean ? that is up to the viewer , like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film . is this film only for certain individuals ? probably . but i do n't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message . one does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object ; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer . godfrey stated that koyaanisqatsi is related to northern hemisphere societies ; super-sophisticated , hyper-industrial , technological grids that we call societies . to me this film is about how humans have become one with machines . and how we do n't live with nature any longer . we have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it . that technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way , we do not use technology , it is a way of life . but like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves , as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead . the norms of nature no longer fully exist ; it is rather the norms of technology that do . and in so doing technology has become omnipresent . personally i do n't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important . in fact it is , as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.this film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization

1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	my first viewing of the campy film secretary could not have been more ironic because i had been working as a secretary -- ahem , assistant -- for a solo practitioner for only two months . i recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day i would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted , when he wanted it . there are bosses , not just the lawyers , who long for the old-fashioned secretary . bravo to the filmmaker for rendering secretary 's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain . i found , and still find , the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure . not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in secretary is unrealistic . perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full-time assistant . why is that assistant a perfect match ? intellectually , i admire the filmmaker 's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which american society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves . leave it to an art/indie film to expose how some ( or many ? ) american women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis . because american women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men , it is a total thrill in secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt-chasing boss on its head . in terms of casting , i can not imagine anyone but maggie gyllenhaal in the title role . her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of elizabeth taylor 's maggie the cat on that hot tin roof -- full of angst but no less smoldering . maggie g. appears to purr rather than speak . james spader , who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie , gets the chance in secretary to fully realize his erotic potential . while his character can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek , he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance . when you get down to it , the various vicarious experiences in secretary will please some and repulse others . for me , i received instant motivation to strive for accuracy in transcribing my boss 's future dictation
1	this movie points out to us that which we are all capable of ... a moving reminder of our own preciousness..
1	`` dangerous beauty '' is a beautiful period piece based on a non-fiction book . the movie is set in 16th century venice . veronica falls in love with marco , but marco comes from a rich family . veronica 's mother advises her that she should become a courtesan so that she can spend time with marco . veronica does so well at the courtesan business that she becomes a favorite of all the men in the city . later she becomes the target of an inquisition by the church for witchcraft . a beautiful story about how women survive in society
1	this is a wonderful film . it has powerful messages . there are numerous examples of how teamwork acheives something . my favourite is the tale we are told in little scraps about how the kid sister got wounded driving a guy to the air base - so he could fly a fighter and shoot down some japs . the film is emotionally very powerful . it is designed to make you hate japanese people , and to support bombing of enemy cities . there was a war on - there was a need to get people to support such policies . since the official policy was to put japanese americans in concentration camps , the film justifies the policy . similarly the film portrays the effectiveness of us military equipment such as bomb-sights in a positive way . they were hardly going to portray it as hopeless . the film is not historically accurate . it would not have been helpful to have produced a historically accurate film . cnn reports about kosovo in 1998-99 were just as inaccurate for the same reasons
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
0	one of the worst films of a generation . many talented comedic ( dave thomas - colleen camp ) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral .
0	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment , but overall it 's long and pretty boring . it seems it would have been better suited as a play , which apparently it was originally . i had just finished re-reading romeo and juliet when i rented this , thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood , but this did n't do it for me . i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet , it would have been better . my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries , completely amusing . could n't wait for the movie to end , honestly
1	this is a wonderful movie and i have always enjoyed it from the first time that i watched it when i was 20 something . then to see the actress that plays miss ellie on dallas in such a young roll . it was excellent . the story is endearing and shows the many facets of ones life
1	magic looks very nice on dvd . solid clean picture quality with original basic mono soundtrack . a pleasant suprise from dark sky films
1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east ( mainly china 's ) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy . yi soon shin , however , is a rare exception . not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the chosun political factions ( and the second-guessing nature of the king ) which causes his eventual death . also , the special effects are great . the battle scenes ( whether on sea or land ) are realisitic and of outstanding quality . the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china . then again , this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral . also , the entire selection should have 104 episodes . i do n't know why it stops at 101 . if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject , try samuel hawley 's imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources ) . any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion ( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun : total war by creative assembly ( now in gold version ) .
1	this character buckaroo banzai played by peter weller is an incredible individual . a well accomplished person who is half japanese , brain surgeon , scientist , martial artiste , and rock star . he also knows how to ride a motorcycle . bb is backed up with a special hand picked team of men known as the '' blue blazers '' . in this episode they battle aliens from planet 10 across the 8th dimension . john lithgow stars as the demented dr. emilio lizardo in one of his greatest roles . blue blazer regulars such as perfect tommy , reno , jersey , rawhide , and pinky caruthers add to the amusement but pacos is in tibet . the characters are colorful . as `` another you '' , ellen barkin plays penny pretty who safeguards the overthruster . flaws with the script would be `` why would orson wells be giving the news during halloween 1938 and changing it to h.g . wells `` war of the worlds '' ? i thought he did fiction like `` citizen kane '' not report news events of the era such as the tragedy of the hindenburg disaster for example . is orson wells related to h.g . wells or tom cruise ? the movie is entertaining . we can see why peter weller today stars in documentaries on the history channel . i only wish there be re-issues of the `` kids from c.a.p.e.r . `` ( civilian authority for the protection of everyone regardless ) television show originally aired back in 1975 and before they battled indians , the original `` ghostbusters '' also '75 starting larry stork , forrest tucker , kong . the songtrack on these shows were great . bb the hong kong cavaliers are not the monkeys . bb lacks a decent song track . at least we get to see the devote effort of saving mankind from world destruction armed only with slingshots , boyscout knives , and six shooters unlike today where captain america ca n't even save himself or maybe it 's because america is only doing a job we all know needs to be done . the movie was put together well . it is a classic . jeff goldberg also appears in this film but i do n't know why . anyway , `` wherever you go , there you are ''
1	being from midland you might say i 'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie . this movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies ' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released ( that 's how fast the bust hit ) . terry jastrow ( who is from midland ) and his real life wife anne archer are great opposite each other on the screen while mary kay place provides great commentary on life in texas oil business
1	see the digital rendition of the historical zapruder film from november of 1963 . there 's no way it could have been only one gunman
0	the claim purports to be an adaptation of thomas hardy 's classic novel , the mayor of casterbridge transplanted to the old west . the producers clearly wanted the claim to be accepted as a literate western and it is clear that the critics fell for it . however , as anyone who has read the original hardy novel can tell you , the movie fails as a hardy adaptation . meanwhile , any fan of movie westerns can tell you that the claim is a failure in that department as well . the claim begins in 1869 where daniel dillon ( peter mullan ) lords supreme over his company town . his gold mining company is a topflight operation . dillon is easily one of the most admired men in california , if not in the nation . however , dillon is not a terribly happy man . deep down , he broods over a dark secret that , if exposed , could lead to the destruction of his reputation . you see , the gold claim was originally made by another man , but dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim . the prospector thereupon took both wife and child to boston and raised the family there . meanwhile , dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of california . needless to say , if it became public knowldege that dillon 's success was based on the sale of human beings , that would be nothing short of disastrous . matters are brought to a head when his wife ( nastassja kinski ) , daughter ( milla jovovich ) and his wife 's subsequent daughter with the other man ( sarah polley ) show up in town and request that he take them in as his family . just when you think that things are going to get interesting , the rug is pulled out from the audience 's feet when it is revealed that dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal . this enabled him to marry his ex-wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union . this effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make the claim a colossal bore
1	being released as part of a two disc , dual layered dual sided hammer horror set from universal in september , `` curse of the werewolf '' features a fine performance from a very young oliver reed . you 'll need to use the asin below or the webpage to find it as it is n't listed ( at present ) under its own title but under `` phantom of the opera '' . set in spain ( although guy evans source novel is set in france ) reed plays leon who 's mother died during child birth and whose father raped the girl . born in christmas day , it 's clear that leon is cursed ; the baptism water boils which is not a good sign to say the least . the boy is adopted by don alfredo corledo ( clifford evans ) . early on it 's clear things are amiss as livestock are routinely killed whenever the moon is full . as leon grows into adulthood and he discovers the truth about his past and learns what he really becomes when the moon is full . featuring a surprisingly good script by anthony hinds ( writing as john elder ) and featuring a top flight cast `` curse of the werewolf '' is one of fisher 's best films . like `` horror of dracula '' , fisher managed to put his stamp on the hammer films he directed for the studio and his personality informs the film much as it did his other films . go to : http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0009x770o/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/103-7994494-6895042 ? % 5fencoding=utf8=glance or : asin : b0009x770o to order this fine film .
0	i do n't think so . contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script . think about it : take a dump on a stock and get wiped out ; now you are a messenger ? i do not think so . i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades , but this is crazy . thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum . yes , he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote
1	i loved this quirky movie . i am glad to have it on dvd .
0	all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci-fi story with beautiful babes all over the place . well , there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies , never materialized . has the art of `` posing '' been lost by modern girls ? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity ... why , i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end . in spite of my being a certifiable `` dirty old man '' . [ : - )
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
1	la haine is basically a day in the lives of three guys from ghettos on the outskirts of paris . after an apparently race-motivated police beating/murder , the ghettos are rife with looters , rioters , and many bigoted and intrusive police ( or pigs , as the characters fondly refer to them ) , suspicious of anyone not caucasian or under 30 . in its most reductive form , it 's about a flawed society whose seams are bursting under the pressures of ignorance , intolerance , and various -isms . in the movie itself , this tends to remain below the surface of the characters ' existences , but for in a few moments ( namely encounters with police and skinheads ) and brought to the forefront with a bathroom scat anecdote and repeated reference to a ( very bitter ) joke involving society , man , and rabbit jumping off a building ( the movie is frequently funny ) . although it takes place in france , where these issues are perhaps less closeted ( what with le pen getting 15 percent of the vote ... ) , any close examination of pretty much every `` modern , 1st world '' nation will reveal just how ingrained these problems are in the present state of the world
0	this man is like michael bay . using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing , the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny , and that is also why the man who is now making x-men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies . the man is a joke
1	i had never seen this movie , and i dont know why ! freddie bartholomew ( top-billed as a teen ! ) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy . over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching . a terrific olio of pathos , comedy , melodrama , and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel ( which im embarrassed to admit i never read ) one of the best movies ive seen . great supporting work by lionel barrymore , john carradine , mickey rooney , melvyn douglas , more . and freddie is quite the beauty here . a winner !
0	this was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by sir arthur conan doyle . it did n't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters . the plot and scripting are incredibly weak , it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the credits there . the cgi dinosaurs ' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff . in my opinion , not worth the $ 83 it costs
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode . not only did i get charged , but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge - i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund . once it finished downloading , it did n't play anyway . i gave up .
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made . i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies . they are either worse than this one ( rare ) or better than this one . as an example : buffalo '66 is worse . if you watch both in the same day , you will surely die
0	the only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the natalie holloway case , about the girl last summer that went on that school trip , went off with a boy and disappeared . in this movie , hilary duff 's character is on a school trip to rome , meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around rome . i felt so bad that disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of natalie holloway . in this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they did n't even show that part . young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie . hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place
1	a fellow is jailed for killing his estranged wife , but he actually had been at a bar , picked up a woman and took her to a show . except that the cops do n't believe him because everyone says they never saw him with the woman . his secretary , ella raines , is determined to find the phantom lady , with the help of his best friend and a detective . nice jobs by franchot tone as the best friend and thomas gomez as the detective , and a great job by elisha cook jr as a strange drummer who takes raines to an after-hours jazz club . i 've always liked tone and think he was a very good actor . and as the years went by he became even better . this is a solid noir with a couple of unusual , surreal scenes . one of these days i hope someone brings it out on dv
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon . the quality . sure , you can watch it for free on cbs , but the quality is n't very good . it 's streamed and the bitrate ( quality ) is low . personally , i want to watch survivor on my 50 '' plasma , not on my computer screen . so , i use unbox + windows media center to make that happen . survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider .
1	this is a surprisingly good show . it manages to have 'a little ' violence , sex , and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid , and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting , humorous and kind of addicting to an adult . a modern nancy drew , is veronica mars . i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here ; i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well . i 'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest , i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks . i 'm glad i did
1	this has got to be the best adaptation of jane eyre that i have ever seen . and samantha morton is the reason . she is positively delightful in the title role . she has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll . one of her lines of dialogue is incorrect . she says `` i am not a beauty , i am jane eyre '' . truthfully speaking , she is a beauty ! the story flows smoothly . it 's not too long nor too short . my favorite used to be the orson wells , joan fontaine version . but after seeing this british version , i had to change . you will not go wrong buying it
1	buy this dvd today . be sure to purchase the boxset as it is the only way to get the richard pryor special ? and mudbone bonus footage . this groundbreaking series paved the way for not only ( the obvious ) in living color and chappelles show , but other subversive tv like south park which attempt to inject social commentary while challenging the censors . it not only captures pryor at his comedic peak , but gives us early glimpses of folks like robin williams , sandra berhard , marsha warfield and john witherspoon . this show has never been available on home video and has basically been out of circulation since its initial run , thus it is a jewel to behold . watching pryor as the mojo , the first black president and rev . white -- who has his own way to drum up the big bucks -- will have you laffing for hours . but pryor also presents scketches that were n't designed to be laugh out loud funny , but challenge you in other ways , like the wino sketch that turns into a maya angelo performance . or the satin doll sketch , which has no laughs at all , but aims to capture the feeling of post wwii black america with a fantastic song-and-dance number starring paula kelly ( choreographed by michael peters . ) i seriously doubt these five hours of television would have come out the same if the nbc censors had been completely undertanding , sensitive and supportive of mr. pryor 's vision . the special is an extension of mr. pryor 's hosting of snl . the subsequent series itself reminds me of marvin gaye 's here , my dear . while it is not marvin 's most listenable or even best work , through pain he finds beauty and truth . this boxset is a must-have for fans of tv comedy and shoud be copped by any means necessary
0	for those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a s/m relationship , i would highly suggest the japanese film , `` moonlight whispers '' over `` maitresse . '' that film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme , while `` maitresse '' is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a ( highly unlikely ) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix . the ex-con can not deal with `` her career '' eventually and threatens her to quit , etc . ( at some point , you get the idea that the director himself really does n't understand where the domina is coming from . ) what started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through . the writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection ( or pimp , for want of a better word ) . then , we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse , where a real horse is shown killed onscreen , strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly ( this image will upset you for weeks , believe me ! [ i feel like it 's my duty to warn you ! ] ) . and the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots . totally stupid ( like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas ) . believe me , i really wanted to like this movie . i ignored the negative reviews , because there are so few `` real '' films on this subject . but i was sorely disappointed and depressed by it . if you need to see this film , rent it . it 's definitely a `` one view '' film at best ; and it will be a film that will leave you angry ( because the horse scene ) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out . too bad . `` moonlight whispers '' is a much better , respectful treatment of s/m , a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological ( and sexual orientation ) questions , while also being a beautiful film to watch . that film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience !
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	cagney 's startling performance as tommy powers , in william wellman 's public enemy , was to be expected . he was powerful when needed . gentle , with his short jabs of affection . and his fast-talking wit , whether in anger or in good-spirits , was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars . or was it to be expected in 1931 ? i did n't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star edward woods was supposed to be the lead , and that cagney was to play matt . at the last minute , in movie minutes , the roles were switched . and yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts . ( edward woods was incredibly underrated . does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938 ? he lived for decades after that . ) i wo n't rehash the plot here but i must pay homage to every cast member . jean harlowe -- what more can be said ? leslie fenton as `` nails '' nathan was a study in polished brutality . joan blondell as mamie was cute as a button with her wide-eyed perkiness , and sincere affection for her matt . donald cook could not have been better cast as the brooding , righteous older brother to tom . ( at points , he 's tougher than cagney 's tommy . ) beryl mercer as ma gets away with being so sweet without being saccharine . british actor murray kinell is just slimy enough to deserve his end , as the fagin-like putty nose . and last , but definitely not least , is robert o'connor as the paternal crime boss , paddy ryan , who is sincere in his care for his young apprentices . the uncredited child actors who played the young tommy and matt were priceless . now can anyone tell me who tony the waiter was : i loved his only line : `` pop ! bur-r-p ! pa-pop ! '' as for the dvd itself , well the sound was sometimes muddy , and the changes in film quality -- where they restored previously edited material -- are jarring . but so what ? you can see and hear every word in this masterpiece better than films made ten years ago that were sloppily transferred to digital . and the warner night at the movies ( 1931 ) was a brilliantly executed way to let us experience what it must have been like to go to the movies 75 years ago . this is a must-have disc for lovers of gangster movies or the classics
0	most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning srdjan dragojevic film at select film festivals in the u.s. have not forgotten its clarity , its anger , and its power . the movie was passed up for theatrical distribution , although it was readily available on vhs and now on dvd from fox lorber . this dvd is a bust in every thinkable way , although fox lorber was obviously aiming very low . the phrase `` bare-bones '' is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary , dismissive releases , lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant . this dvd does contain a trailer , but the trailer , sadly , looks better than the feature . `` bare-bones '' would have been fine , but watching this disc is torture . it 's obviously a quickie transfer from the vhs -- i could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout , poor audio balance ( with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo ) poor contrast , a muddy , dark image , burnt-in subtitles , and so forth . fox lorber were long the scourge of the art-film dvd market , and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc . new yorker and wellspring ( formerly winstar ) are guilty of similar offenses
1	... but it`s coldly made without much heart . time and time again , readers have been overwhelmed by the old publicity `` garbo the great actress '' , `` the sphinx '' , `` the greatest star '' ... oh i could go on forever ... however , boiled down to the essentials , she had a charismatic , photogenic face , but she never depended on promoting herself : mgm and fellow artists and critics sang their rhapsodies and privately i suspect she overdosed quickly of the superstar-label and became bored with the whole idea . i think she felt she was overpraised much too early in her career and felt embarassed by the never-ending attention . in queen christina she is beautifully lit and photographed ( and from 1927 on - she was filmed behind closed curtains ... with only william daniels and karl freund close at hand ) ... i would say that many an actress with that attention could have easily have filled her shoes . she was a timid actress . cukor once observed that he felt she had to be thrown into the action - she never created . seeing her with constance bennett in two-faced woman og charles boyer in conquest , you`ll see that she can`t reach their standard in scenes she is forced to act and interplay - and not merely pose and being brilliantly photographed in close-up . in queen christina she is a moviestar , not an actress ... so who would i define the ultimate star of the 20th century ? elizabeth taylor ; for all her brilliant performances ( and bad 1s ) , her legendary life and beauty ... now , miss taylor is what a moviestar and a great movieactress is all about..
0	do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie
1	this film is about the battle in the ia drang valley in 1965 vietnam . it begins in 1954 when a french patrol is attacked and defeated in a surprise ambush . a prophecy for the future ? in one scene a wounded french soldier is killed . [ was this truth or drama ? ] then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on `` sambre et meuse '' , which dates to the napoleonic wars . next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles . [ was n't this an adaption of a civilian model ? ] one scene shows officer 's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat . [ are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure ? ] one scene recalls custer 's last battle . custer did not know the size of the enemy ; he assumed about 2,500 and not three times as many . later we hear the intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces . ominous ? the mechanized cavalry lands in their helicopters , the soldiers start shooting . some soldiers run after a lone enemy and are ambushed . the battle erupts in fierce fighting . two helicopters bring in needed ammunition . back in the states telegrams arrive with bad news for the families . were they delivered impersonally ? the battle continues with rising casualties on both sides . air support arrives to drop napalm . some lands too far from the enemy . they expect another attack at dawn . but the tide has turned , the enemy faces defeat and withdraws . the end of the battle shows a load of journalists arriving to take pictures and question the colonel . after the seventh cavalry is withdrawn the vietnamese reclaim their land . the colonel returns to his family in his land . in 1964 general douglas macarthur advised lbj against getting into a land war in asia . could this film have been created as a warning against a war in the middle east ? does it have a subtle anti-war message ? it seems different from his earlier film based on the revolutionary war .
0	i would n't recommend this movie , unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone . due to a high content of bad words , screaming and violence , it 's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else . some people really enjoyed it , and that 's not me , and that 's not the other two people i know who watched it . some violent parts are a bit hard to believe , but i guess that 's what the story is about . this movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense , with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies . there 's one good idea in this movie and that 's how life develops as it goes along , and one action or inaction changes how life plays out . but this is no where near original , even the simpsons had an episode like that . so , this movie is definitely not on my best movies list .
1	how many times have i seen this movie ? somewhere between 25-50 viewings , with an additional `` who knows how many '' occurrences wherein i starting watching this movie with the explicit intent of falling asleep to it 's indie soundtrack . i was turned on to this movie in the very same way i have discovered most of my favorite films . it 's late night , i 'm flipping channels , or to be completely honest , i was browsing the directv guide . most people , including me , still say flipping channels , like we actually take the time to go through all the channels , but we all know damn well that we just cruise through the guide to find something to watch . i guess i 'll have to start saying `` scrolling the guide '' instead . anyway , i 'm getting sidetracked and i apologize . like i said , i was `` scrolling '' through the guide looking for something comfortable and familiar that would n't challenge me too much , and i failed . i had to use that damn `` info '' button when i saw the title , `` tao of steve '' , so i guess i let my curiosity get the best of me . thank science it did . as is my custom , i normally catch these late night gems at some point in the middle of the movie , and i spend the rest of the movie struggling with the decision to either finish what is shaping up to be a great movie that i missed the beginning of , or jot down the title and catch it from the start the next time it comes on . i decided to watch the rest of it , and then just buy a copy on dvd . does that tell you how engaging and entertaining this movie is ? first off , i have a lot of respect for donal logue as an actor . he 's done a wide variety of roles in several different kinds of media vehicles , from tv to blockbuster movies , and of course , the classic jimmie the cab driver shorts on mtv . he was spot on in this role , he has that charisma and confidence to be able to convince you he has what it takes to bed down with any human being sporting an xx chromosomal set , unless they are wearing doc marten 's and a flannel shirt . what can i say , he 's a funny actor , and i suppose he 's a fave of mine , because i have liked him even in the bad stuff he 's been a part of in the past . supporting cast was full of friends and local actors from the nm area , and while there are n't any household names in the bunch , they more than hold their own in delivering believable characters who are just what they are supposed to be , regular joes and janes . i have already mentioned that the soundtrack was indie , and while i am not an authority on indie music , i can recognize it . i ca n't say whether it was great , good , or bad , but i liked it . i also liked that the band featured live in the reunion scene was from oklahoma , my home state . the most striking thing about this movie for me was it 's beautiful photography and wonderful selection of locations . although it was been a while since i watched the commentary , i am fairly certain it was filmed entirely in the taos , new mexico area , or maybe it was albuquerque . if you 've never been to nm , then go now , it is awesomely beautiful and full of tons of stuff to do . it definitely scores some cultural points with me , as i am a big fan of the american west . the colors of the landscape truly come through the lens with full strength , and i just love the way this movie looks . i ca n't help but feel that the physical environment is an important ingredient in the `` tao of steve '' , which is a real thing conjured up by a real man . in fact , the house where dex lives is the actual house of the real life person who dex is based upon . he makes a cameo during one of the poker scenes , and on the commentary he provides some interesting insight into the movie , the character dex , and of course the `` tao of steve '' . the plot is actually the only weak part of the movie , as a story , it 's predictable , but i think that 's okay because i found it more interesting to delve into unanswerable questions concerning the characters , and of course , as a hopelessly single young man who has never been able to get the ladies , i spent much time asking myself , `` will this really work in real life , ... ..my life ? '' well , according to duncan north , the aforementioned inspiration for dex , it does work , and he 's living proof . so stop listening to professor tom leykis you bitter bastard , and start watching the , `` tao of steve '' . it has all the lessons you need . thekeeth , ( who is shockingly , still unsuccessful with the ladies )
1	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere . if you come across a copy of this buy it . it is reminissant of american history x , or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen-aged boys comming of age . while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen , this will hit home for the rest of us . drugs are bad ! ! :
1	why do i call this film the best jayne mansfield movie ? .well , it is the largest-budget film she ever appeared in + the film was hers.the studio had paid quite a bundle for that play , that basically put ms. mansfield on the map.even 'the girl ca n't help it ' ( also a great movie ) , was padded ( no pun intended jaynie ! ) with rock'n roll numbers , because the studio was scared that jayne could not carry the film alone ( were they ever wrong ! ) . to get back to rock hunter , the person that did the switch from the movie-satire to television-satire , did an excellent adaptation job.tony randall is fine as the ordinary-all-american-joe.betsy drake is also good , in her plainesss ( about a zillion women must have been able to relate to her ) .joan blondell is fantastic , reminiscing about her milkman ! . something that i have not read in the reviews are all the very obvious cheap-shots at marilyn:1-about being a communist ( at the same time that mm had problems with miller as they were travelling to england for 'the prince and the showgirl'.2-about the brother karamazov ( mm wanted that role badly ) .we can easily understand why monroe disliked mansfield so much . jayne never looked better ; after all she was then on top of the world ! , and could have stayed there a little longer if she had not decided to get married to mr.universe 1955 , basically telling the heads of the studios to go to hell.that was one wrong move , because after this film , her career went nowhere fast , and it went down , down , way down ... it is a shame.god only knows what other gems she could have appeared in . in conclusion , i find that this film gives us an idea of what jayne 's real life was about.oh yes , and before i forget ! that scene when she gets off the plane ? .well the master himself , and i am naming federico fellini was heavily inspired by it in 'la dolce vita ' , four years later with sweden 's answer to jayne ... anita ekberg , when she gets off the plane herself.the exact same scene , but mansfield did it first , and a big bravo to you jayne the epitome of hollywood fifties
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes . yes , it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment , but not enough to watch this film . it could be a cure for insomnia , though . fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed . you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen , and it 's really just very boring . all those fans of johnny depp : be particularly warned . he may have co-star billing , but blink and you 'll miss him
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	i was so happy to recieve this movie , its very rarely shown on tv , i own my own thanks to amazon . the music in this movie is magnificent it 's something to treasure for a life time .glen miller was a great composer , one of my favorites is moonlight serenade , they just cant make music like this any more , this is a great movie to add to your collection . thank you amazo
1	i like the story line of this movie , but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven . it was scary back then , even with limited special effects and no graphic details . watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time . this film is in its own right a science fiction classic .
0	i saw this on tcm years ago and i thought what is all the fuss about . i do not like how it glorifies that leaving your wife and kid is swell . the men look more like lady 's then the men in this movie that are after her . also this movie is so long and boring . do n't get me wrong i like foreign films even the ones that are slow like wild strawberries , umberto d and such but this one did nothing for me . another thing his wife is alot more actrative then the woman he desires . you can tell i did not mention character names well i forgotten them i only seen this moive me once and that was enough . a other thing i need to mentin why is that criterion charges so much for there dvds other dvds are restored as well and they are cheaper and most of chiterion dvds do not even have a whole lot of bonus features
1	this album has pure energy , pure lyrics , pure beats . everything went right in this soundtrack . public enemy seldomly puts out any bad albums . the title song in this album `` he got game '' was a pretty weak song . the beats were nice though , but this song leans a little towards the blues and jazz catogorie . that was the only song that i disliked out of 12 tracks . the album starts off with the song ressurection , that track was so beautifully produced it sounded way beyond public enemy 's music . masta killa dropped a verse that was so so tight . track 3 wit krs-one was one of the best , number 5 had a cool beat . the rest of the tracks were just public enemy style . this is a great album for a public enemy fan
0	after viewing the avengers with emma peel , which i do every evening after the dreadful news , enjoying repeats and repeats as well , with reluctance i played the hospital dvd . i thought it was terrible . the diagogue idiotic . i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana . emma peel would have thrown him across the room . i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd . the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman , and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection , with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd . i see that this dvd was dated 1971 , this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967 . in hospital , i believe she was 33 years old . oh well , i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel . finall , john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor . can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode . perhaps they will issue hospital 11 , and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series . robert lyons reno , nevad
1	at the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope , and has held up remarkably well , despite a few touches of typical silent overacting/heavy-handedness . still , the 1925 hur belongs in any collector 's collection for its importance in film history . not to mention the fact that it sealed mgm 's financial future . so of course , as of this writing , the greedy oinkers at the studios have n't released it on dvd because it wo n't sell 4 million copies
0	amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity , but otherwise this film did nothing for me . a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests ? i ca n't even relate . and they 're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness ? yeah right ! see it if you 're a big fan of fart jokes , or whatever..
0	with `` death on the nile , '' the producers of the a `` poirot '' series can claim to have broken all ties with the original british program starring david suchet , save the presence of the star . the qualities that made the original program endearing-the wit , the exquisite production design , the fastidious attention to detail , the superb character acting of both the regulars and guests-are gone . that is not to say that this new poirot is completely devoid of redeeming qualities , just that they pale in comparison with the original series . the novel from which the movie is derived provides one of christie 's more complexly interwoven series of plots and sub-plots . it is no coincidence that the late 70s theatrical version starring peter ustinov ran well over two hours , and even at that simplified the story considerably . this new adaptation effectively eliminates the motivations for murdering the victim for most of the characters , and even those with motivation are given barely a scene or two to express those reasons . there really is n't much going on at all except the central love triangle and poirot 's sage pronouncements on the sidelines . even so , the movie seems to be rushing to its conclusion , as if all involved had other commitments they were eager to fulfill . even suchet just seems tired of the part , racing through his summing up speech as if reading a laundry list . ( and the screenwriters really should be shot for burdening poirot with pensive regrets about his failed love life . if there is one thing true of christie 's poirot , it was that he did n't give a hoot about emotional entanglements . this is a sentimental hack 's notion of `` deepening '' a character best known for his airy aloofness . ) the compensations ? some nasty humor at the edges which may not be everyone 's cup of tea . some nice location photography , and the occasional odd bit of behavioral detail from some of the supporting players . alaistair mackenzie as the aristocrat going through a marxist phase and steve pemberton as the mysterious dr. bessner stand out . at their best , they are within calling distance of the better character playing in the series , although in pemberton 's case , at least , the character has been stripped of any motivation , and thus is something of a gratuitous appendage to the mystery . otherwise , it 's a depressing lack of distinction across the board . a would be doing all of us a favor by stopping now , while they are behind .
1	this great film will finally be available on dvd on january 31st , 2006 .
1	scooby doo rocks ! this was an awesome episode , and an awesome way to download some of the earlier episodes of scooby . fun stuff , and an inexpensive download
0	this film is a documentary , not a movie . for those of you who admire european films with honest , casual nudity , this film may not be for you . european films with honest , casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content . this film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level . if you want to view this film , fine , but be prepared for some tears and nausea . this film is not for the faint-hearted . though here in america we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity , yet , to europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation i ask , where are your child protection agents , your social workers , your law-enforcement agents , your religious leaders and , for crying out loud , the parents ? i admire europe 's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity , whether on the screen or on their beaches , but when you view this film , you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in america against sexual exploitation . i can not think of a more vicious , sinister crime . i believe the body has a soul , only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body , let alone a normal , healthy childhood . my poor heart just cries out to them . i practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question . i was going to rent `` angels , but not angels , '' but this film , and `` mandragora '' , were enough for me
1	if you are interested in knowing what challenges monarches and other powerful people face , this movie is a great beginning . you may or may not be interested in russian history or even world history , but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional , physical and political issues faced by two powerfully-born adults and their children . other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses , so i will not go into too much detail to `` sell '' anybody on the action or dialogue , or historical accuracy . suffice to say this movie -- in its unedited version ( crucial for dvd ) does in fact tell it like it is ( or was ) . nicholas and alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the 20th century . they were responsible , in an almost biblical sense , for the destiny of humanity , only they opted out , and were then executed . this would be considered `` romantic '' if humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for leadership by designated heroes . the dvd version is critical to see the full relationship between alexandria and rasputin as a surrendering of power , and also to see rasputin in his full decadent expression ( which must be positively repulsive to russian history revisionists . ) it is also necessary , in an emotional and historic context , to see the `` failure '' of nicholas -- that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead . it is also relevant to see the execution of rasputin at the hands of the two hop-head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead , and that they themselves had dreams of american incorporation . alexia ( nicholas and alexandra 's only son , who also happened to be a hemophiliac ) hates his persecutors with a very personal , adult hatred -- those who persecuted the romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised . they loved their leaders , and despised their need for leaders . if you purchase this movie , whatever your reason or interest , please buy the dvd so that it is unedited ( meaning uncensored ) so thatyou may judge for yourself
0	if a `` suspense '' filmed was played in the woods , and it did n't actually contain any suspense , would a bear watch it ? the previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making `` domestic disturbance '' , the newest `thriller ' starring john travolta , vince vaughn and teri polo . let 's talk for a few minutes about mr. travolta . can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them ? i think that travolta has now surpassed richard dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king . after a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer quentin tarantino in `` pulp fiction '' , travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices . `` face/off '' and `` broken arrow '' highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed travolta to join the $ 20 million club . in the last few years , every film travolta has appeared in has failed miserably . `` lucky numbers '' ? `` the general 's daughter '' ? that film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it ? `` swordfish '' ? interesting , but a flop . `` battlefield earth '' ? why does he keep making this trash ? it has to be the paychecks . i ca n't see any other conceivable reason . john , baby , how long before the studios realize that these films are n't making any money and they stop hiring you ? john , baby , how long before you need another comeback vehicle ? frank morrison ( john travolta ) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats . he does n't get a lot of business , but the business that he does get gets a great deal . he does n't charge his customers enough to make a profit . frank does this because he is the good guy . his son , danny ( matthew o'leary ) has a lot of problems accepting his mom 's ( teri polo ) new relationship with rick barnes ( vince vaughn ) . he gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone . a couple of days after his mom and rick get married , he stows away in rick 's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate . the police do n't believe him however . after a little soul searching , frank believes his son . he may lie to everyone , but he does n't lie to frank . directed by harold becker ( `` sea of love '' ) , `` domestic disturbance '' is a suspense film without any suspense . from the moment danny stows away in rick 's car and watches him murder ray ( steve buscemi ) , which we also watch , we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is . to make matters worse , frank instantly believes his son , which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between frank and rick . a boring cat and mouse game . when you know the identity of the villain , a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet . when frank believes danny early on , the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it . the film would 've been greatly improved by showing danny in the backseat of the car , watching everything , the pain and suspense registering on his face , while the audience sees nothing . then , when danny tries to convince his dad , the police chief , his mom , that rick is a murderer , at least we have n't seen the act , and we would require some convincing as well . because the filmmakers chose to show us everything , the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have frank doubt danny , his son . however , after a very brief segment , frank believes danny , causing us to watch a battle between frank and rick , which is n't very interesting . each of the actors , including travolta , are serviceable in their roles , but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes , the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium . skip `` domestic disturbance '' . it is n't even worthy of a video rental . go to see the far superior and very different `` amelie '' or `` the man who was n't there '' . your money will be much better spent .
0	i was just waiting for this one to come out on dvd . voila ! it 's here and i rent it . god , oh god , oh god - this film had so much potential and super actors , but the story was so full of holes , i could 've drained my spaghetti in it ! not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered ! ! ! not a single one ! since i refuse to watch it again , i now have to go to bed asking myself if i did n't perhaps miss something . let 's go on the record here : acting - superb ( michael caine 's still got it ) ; filming - superb ; suspense - superb ; action -superb ; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti . everything was there but the plot . like having my palate whet , without ever tasting the dish . frustrating , hmmm
1	i was very pleased with this motion picture . the casting and script were well developed and the performance exquisite . i found pauling collins to be a very credible and delightful personality in the story . i give this rating 5 stars ! thank yo
0	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon.com never sent it too me . this has happened about 4/5 times . while usually i have no problem getting movies , sometimes i do . sending them e-mails does n't seem to work . if they did n't have the best prices for movies , i 'd leave
1	the combination of grant and kerr is wonderful on the screen . i loved the mix of british humor and civility . adding the dash of american brashness in robert mitchum , one can enjoy watching the wheels fall off . a very enjoyable movie
0	this straight-to-video 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison , this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates . the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go `` undercover '' and solve a crime . the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion . however , leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off , ( though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around ) , and there 's a torture scene , ( modeled on the one in `` lethal weapon '' ) , in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks . mr. thomas ' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell .
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made . i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies . they are either worse than this one ( rare ) or better than this one . as an example : buffalo '66 is worse . if you watch both in the same day , you will surely die
1	this is my favorite film of all time ! i am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it - it was an acadamy award winner , so i do n't understand why it 's not gotten much attention over the years ... i find it superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than captains courageous . i do n't know why this is the case , but i am it 's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it ... it is a wonderful and moving story , that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as `` it 's a wonderful life does '' ... if you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you ! do not miss it
0	i 've seen all of elvis ' movies , most several times . this is one of the worst . only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse . i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv , but not these three
1	this dvd is great . it brings back all the memories of the holidays as a young child . it is hard to catch these shows on tv as they only air once during the holiday season . my daughters love them and i love seeing their reaction to the shows . good buy
1	everyone should see this movie . also , everyone should buy it so they can show it to their friends , so the word can keep spreading , and hopefully and finally , justice will be served
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?

1	i do n't have television , have n't for 11 years . when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi , csi ny , csi miami , and ncis . i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far . i enjoy the light-heartedness of ncis . so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox . i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased . as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer . when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way . i like selecting individual shows
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
1	this is a nice love story , a little dumbed down , but with a great message , the money may be the root of all evil , and what is important is the human heart . this is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world . nicholas cage is one of our finest commercial actors . he proves is versatility in this picture . what ever happened to bridget fonda ? ? j
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	the acting in this was very good . it had a great cast . it 's just such a classic . being shakespeare , it may be hard for some people to understand at first , but you catch on pretty quickly
0	at first i did n't realize that you have to use amazon 's software to load onto the zen . once i figured that out ( actually my husband figured that out ) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do . i was n't able to edit the stars . if i could i would give this 5 stars . if you have tried some other sites for the zen , they are much more difficult to use . amazon 's unbox is great for the zen
1	a very enjoyable retelling of shakespeare 's `` romeo and juliet '' . `` valley girl '' may be an extremely outdated movie , but it still makes me laugh
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
1	my favorite peckinpah film . yeah , you heard me right . this is the one where we can clearly perceive sam flying of the deep end , and yet it is still some kind of graceful ugly crazy masterpiece . there are jarring deliberate shifts in tone from lyrical to brutal and ugly to downright surreal . it 's willfully sloppy at times , with some shots that do n't match at all and some of the worst day for night you 've ever seen at one point ( that may actually be the fault of mgm 's dvd - i do n't know ) . none of that matters a whit . this is a surprisingly heartfelt pitch black comedy with an outstanding squirrelly performance by warren oates - and isela vega is awesome . `` alfredo '' is a road movie from hell - funny , horrifying and totally captivating . and i do n't just mean so-bad-its-good - this is an important film and i love every stinkin ' minute of it . but if you have pedestrian tastes , stay away . this is probably the fullest cinematic expression of the bitter and abrasive side of peckinpah 's personality that is so well documented . most people do n't seem to know how to take it . take it as a beautiful reckless personal horror film that is laceratingly funny one minute and just lacerating the next . the final image says it all . p.s . the scene between kristofferson and vega seems to confuse a lot of people , as it should . but you might want to listen to the words of the song kristofferson 's partner is singing to oates in the background as this scene plays out . there is a possible reading of this scene that i think a lot of people might not have picked up on . it 's also interesting in light of the particular paranoia that made it hard for any woman to be in a relationship with sam ...
0	well , nice cinematography as set-designer work : nicely interiors and well dressed actors . maybe , visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once , but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year , as other reviewers trying to assure
1	one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin , charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his `` family '' simple , straightforward action that never lets up . the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes [ ... ] . bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years
0	when pokemon first debuted , i thought it would rock , and misty , brock , and ash would stay together as a gang forever , and ash would love it to just be walking around the world , earning badges , etc. , and that 's the way it would stay . maybe even ash and misty would fall in love ! but , nope . the dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive pokemon cards , and the animation is just getting cheaper . this movie is totally different from the original movies and the tv series , and it sucks . i 'll hold on to the older series and dvd 's , but , nowadays , brock and misty are gone , and it 's just boring without them . for those who agree with me , get the message out there that pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks . bring back brock and misty ! ! ! it will save the series ! oh , and i 'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous , with so much change , and so little things the same . : - ( boo
1	this is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject . the clips of ginsberg & amp ; burroughs are especially effective . the celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself & amp ; not just empty theatrics . the beats are still a source to return to for inspiration & amp ; insight . the world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now . of course there 's more , but this video gives you enough to get you started & amp ; gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late

0	this movie started off about as refreshing as you could get . sure , there were `` lifetime channel '' moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one . the atmosphere was eerie and convincing . the cave shots were well done , the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un-nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing . so , the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way . unfortunately , like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly . the creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity . too much ketchup , too many frantic scenes of the `` monster guys '' jumping around , and of course ... the completely silly `` tough '' chick that kung-fu'ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids . that alone killed it ... . the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable . i was angry at this movie not so much because i wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the `` gorefest '' route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right . remember how perfectly the original alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension ? remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time ? this film started that way ... . it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy . just like alien . however , alien never let up and did not turn into a pointless gore-fest like this movie did . too bad , it really is . not recommended ... but rent it , dont buy it if you have to see i
0	since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and i love films passionately , i am absolutely beside myself in fury and anger at the horrible packaging on this magnificent film . i could forgive the lack of extras . i know a lot of people working for these international movie conglomerates do n't give a damn about the classics ( or even movies in general , really ) . but the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great , perfect , scene-by-scene- , shot-by-shot , movie is staggering . not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images , not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring ... they picture the villianess , not the heroine , with the hero ! where is the original poster art ! ! ! ! ! the insert art ! ! ! the half sheet art ! ! ! the reissue art ! ! ! there . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . nothing ! this looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . columbia pictures.. i am shouting . at . you
0	by the time you see the ending , you 'll already be wishing that you had n't watched this movie
1	juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s , possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous . originally a bryan forbes film , forbes was briefly replaced by don medford ( who had also briefly taken over the guns of navarone after alexander mackendrick was fired and before j. lee thompson was hired ) before richard lester took over . while it 's easy to spot some of the typical lester touches ( such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions ) , it 's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what . regardless of where the credit lies , the end result is a terrific thriller , with richard harris ' bomb disposal team parachuted to omar sharif 's liner with several bombs aboard while anthony hopkins tries to track down the extortionist in london . the bomb disposal scenes are genuinely tense , the characterisation surprisingly strong enough to undercut potential clich ? s and alan plater 's dialog quite superb , with the film offering both the required suspense and a neat little state-of-the-nation address of britain in the early 70s . really rather terrific .
0	considered by many fans to be the best season ever , survivor : the australian outback - the complete second season is being released april 26 , 2005 . this brief review of the season is ok , but the season set is definitely the better buy . the season set is six discs , one of them being this disc . do not buy this if you are buying the season set
1	like everyone says , this is a very strange story . it seems to be a love-triangle , but there are more angles than three . for about half the film i thought glenn ford was meant to be in love with the ballin mundson ( ballin mundson ? ) character , because he saved ford 's life ( what for ? ) , then gave him a job and was good to him . so far , so odd , but relatively simple to understand . when rita shows up things become extremely complicated : incomprehensible in fact . who had run out on who , and why ? i think we should have been told . was it something to do with rita 's earlier line of work ? a lot of blame was being put on rita , but so far as i could see she was n't doing much wrong . well , maybe just a bit of a tease , but so lovely , sweet and tender you 'd forgive her anything . actually , nobody 's motivation here was the slightest bit convincing . also , as somebody else has said , the plot reads as if someone put together the pieces left on the cutting-room floor after casablanca . anyway , two-thirds into the story , we get a totally alien sub-plot about conquering the world by cornering the tungsten filament market , which we could n't care less about , as it has nothing to do with the tensions between the three main players . this part is boring and even more unconvincing than the original triangle . the sinister mr mundson looked good in his part , but it seemed as if he was n't being allowed to get his teeth into the role . glenn ford has never impressed me as a personality . he never seems to have what it takes : i ca n't imagine rita falling for him , nor can i believe he could take out heavies with his puff-ball punches . i ca n't even believe he 'd behave like the nasty little swine he 's supposed to be . so why have i watched this movie two or three times , and why will i watch it again ? only one answer : you said it , folks -- - rita hayworth .

1	v for vendetta was already out on dvd before i finally saw it . my college roommates told me that it was a great movie , so i finally went to blockbuster and rented a copy . the next day i returned the copy and went to best buy and bought my own copy of the movie , it was that good . v for vendetta takes place in the not so distant future in england , where the residents have a curfew that they need to follow if they do n't want to be arrested , dirty cops and policemen hand out their own cruel form of justice , and where our female hero evey [ payed by natlie portman ] lives . after being cornered by several dirty cops evey is rescued by the charismatic , fast talking , highly intelligent masked man simply named , v. v is a man of many words , and he explains in the movie that he is tired of the `` big brother '' style of living that everyone has to endure . although the government controls the entire city v is upset that the population is not fighting back and taking back their own lives . he explains he is a one man crusade to evey as he blows up the old bailey building to opera music as he laughs uncontrollably at one point . this is a movie anyone will like , except you probably would n't want the kids watching because of the violence and language . v is a guy you will totally like because he is charming to the ladies , cool to hang out with and watch movies [ his favorite is the count of monte cristo ] and also is one tough son of a bitch who uses knives and martial arts to take out his enemies . evey is also great to see in this movie . she is the daughter of political activists who were killed after speaking too loud against government corruption . she also literally got her head shaved in one of the scenes in the movie ! natalie portman was great . the movie is awesome to watch . it is fast paced and exciting in a lot of scenes . from v taking over the tv station in england and talking on every single tv screen in the city as he fights the government , to evey getting caught by the government and sitting in a cell for several months with a shocking ending . great movie to see . the extras include : `` freedom forever ! '' the making of v for vendetta `` designing the near future '' the artistic look at making v for vendetta `` remember remember '' the look at the man named guy fawkes easter egg ! a saturday night live digital short plus more !
1	my favorite wife is not among the very best comedies of pre-war hollywood , but it is nonetheless quite excellent , driven by a strong script , superb lead performers , and a number of great character performances . cary grant is the finest comic actor film has produced and this film demonstrates that as well as any . though he was equally as good in classics such as bringing up baby and the philadelphia story , those films were so marvelously directed , so superbly well written , and filled with such an overabundance of great actors that one might not notice just how outstanding grant was ( that is not the case with his girl friday , where even among an embarrassment of riches , grant stands out and dominates the film ) . here grant is surrounded by fewer talented actors , is working with a slightly less superb ( though still quite good ) script , and is directed by the writer instead of the director originally scheduled for the project . originally the plan was to reunite grant , irene dunne , and leo mccarey , the big threesome of the classic 1937 screwball the awful truth . unfortunately , mccarey had a car wreck just before shooting was begun and was unable to be on the set . canin did a good if not spectacular job . unlike his fellow writers billy wilder and preston sturges , both of whom became fulltime directors of their own scripts around this time , canin primarily remained a writer for the rest of his career . still , the film was more successful than it should have been , mainly because of cary grant , though irene dunne was certainly a strong presence as his costar . but in rewatching the film , it becomes obvious that almost all of the great comic moments are grant 's . what is remarkable is that he essentially plays a coward . the plot is simple . a man goes before a judge to get his wife declared dead after she has been missing for several years , apparently drowned in the indian ocean , so that he will be free to remarry . the judge grants the request and then marries them , but of course the next scene shows the wife who has been declared dead arriving at her home , just after being rescued ( why she would n't have called first is n't explained ) . learning that her husband has remarried and is about to go on his honeymoon , she follows after . much of the humor of the film revolves around cowardice , grant 's inability to tell his new wife that his old wife has miraculously returned from the dead , and dunne 's reticence to tell him that she had been stranded on the island with beefcake randolph scott . that really is about all the plot there is . they manage to get a lot of mileage out of grant 's inability to come out and say what he wants . he is the epitome of the incommunicative male . the film is also enlivened by a number of superb supporting actors . virtually none of the great comedies off the studio era in hollywood failed to feature a group of first rate character actors . here the two that most stand out are granville bates as the judge in a magnificently performed role and donald macbride as the exasperated , confused , and highly suspicious hotel clerk . the film is interesting for the pairing of cary grant and randolph scott , about whom rumors have circulated for decades . i 've never seen any good evidence that either was gay or bisexual or involved with one another , but the rumors have persisted nonetheless . the primary `` evidence '' seems to have been that while they were roommates during the 1930s they were unusually good housekeepers , keeping their apartment meticulous . why neatness should be evidence of homosexuality i am not sure , but we know for a fact that both grant and scott dated women extensively through the thirties , but there is no evidence whatsoever of any physical relationship between the two . sadly , the rumors of their having had a relationship apparently took a toll on their friendship . this film was made well after the rumors had begun but after they had ceased rooming together and well before their friendship largely ended . all in all , this is one of the more enjoyable comic films of the age . it is n't a classic in the mold of his girl friday or bringing up baby or the lady eve , but it is nonetheless an exceptionally easy to like and enjoy film featuring great performers at their peak . note : if one scans the reviews below one will note several mentions of colorized versions . i believe that these refer to the old vhs versions . amazon often meshes reviews of dvds with older reviews of vhs versions of films . as far as i know -- though i could certainly be mistaken -- i do not think this has ever been released on dvd in colorized form . at any rate , the current retail version is certainly in pristine black and white . so do n't be afraid that you are about to purchase a colorized film
1	'zulu ' opens on january 22nd , 1879 with a pacifist missionary otto witt ( jack hawkins ) , and his blonde daughter margareta ( ulla jacobsson ) attending a zulu mass marriage ceremony ... the impressive dancing and chanting takes on a different tone when the preacher discovers that zulu forces have massacred hundreds of british troops at iswandhlwana and are determined to destroy rorke 's drift , an army outpost , in addition to being witt 's mission station ... the shaken reverend arrives and explains the situation to the british officers , advising an immediate evacuation ... to his horror , the officers decide to withstand and defend their ammunition dump with 139 welch infantrymen , a mixture of committed soldiers and complaining malingerers ... the haughty arrogant lt. bromhead ( michael caine ) is in charge , but lt. john chard ( stanley baker ) of the royal engineers - on assignment to build a bridge - takes command actually by strict seniority ... the situation becomes dramatic by the fact that chard has had no combat experience and , on a distinguished level , he is obviously not from an aristocratic background ... but urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station , deploy their men tactically , and prepare for the attack ... then thousands of zulus , armed with short spears and captured rifles , arrive on the grassy hilltops ... their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting ... and then they come into sight ... long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills , promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack ... their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force ... they begin to test the british firing power with the life of their warriors ... the british rifles cut them down and they retreat ... but they come again-and again and again-each time getting closer to the station , cutting down the distance ... every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence ... it seems obviously that any of them will survive ... in every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition ... after a long night , and at the rise of the sun , the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge ... most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help ... few are malingerers , like private hook ( james booth ) , who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand-to-hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building ... outside , the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge , but instead they hear a massed yell from the zulus -- a salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene ... the battle at rorke 's drift was a decisive one in the british campaign to pacify south africa for european settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives ... as a page in british history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the victoria crosses in few hours - to eleven defenders for their extreme courage - an all-time record for one military engagement ... stanley baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer ; michael caine splendid ( in his first major role ) as the pompous aristocrat ; james booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital ; patrick magee excellent as the calm surgeon ; and nigel green , a sergeant of the old order , sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate , as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count ... he looks at them and quietly advises : 'keep your voices down ! ' the film is a superb account of that bloody engagement , and the fighting is shown in realistic detail ... it salutes the heroism of the zulus and the extreme courage of the redcoats ... cy endfield 's direction gives emphasis to the physical exhaustion of nonstop killing , and the effect it has on men , making some tremble with great fear ... more significantly , he avoids any explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , keeping out politics and history ... with john barry 's menacing musical score , `` zulu '' was filmed in natal , south africa and stephen dade captured the luscious colorful landscapes and the sense of strange isolation ... but the most arresting moment in the film is when enfield 's camera pans over a field carpeted with black corpses , gathered side by side or one on top of the other ...
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it . the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk.the main character totally lost it , believing all what her husband was saying about her . she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con
1	from the moment she glimpses her idol on broadway , eve harrington ( anne baxter ) strives relentlessly to upstage margo channing ( bette davis ) . cunningly , eve steals margo 's role , smashes margo 's best friend , karen richards ' ( celeste holm ) marriage , and becomes the toast of broadway ! great performances all around with some of the juiciest , wittiest , and oh so quotable ( `` fasten your seatbelts , it 's going to be a bumpy night '' ) dialogue ever ! i do n't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by george sanders ( rebecca ( 1939 ) , he is truly remarkable as the story 's narrator and broadway critic , addison dewitt . this film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty , marilyn monroe , who plays a bit part as addison 's lovely date at bill 's welcome home party . even here marilyn 's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality ( of which she would later ride to fame on ) is clearly evident . `` all about eve '' has been hailed as `` one of the smartest pictures of all time ... .a picture for any era '' by the l.a. times , and variety put it simply best as `` captivating ! '' it 's interesting to see bette davis and co-starring romantic lead , gary merrill ( who play 's margo 's lover bill sampson ) play out their scenes together , for in real life they actually marry and similar odds ends their relationship . it 's all told in the included special feature , amc 's `` backstory '' telling all about `` all about eve . '' anne baxter and celeste holm are featured in the interviews and give some interesting insights on the film and it 's `` behind the scenes '' antics . bette davis and gary merrill should also not be missed in the 1952 suspense classic , `` another man 's poison . '' a new dvd release of this picture would be much appreciated , for the current release is discontinued . also included in the special features is the film 's gala premiere footage / 1951 academy award footage , in which `` all about eve '' won 1950 's best picture / theatrical trailer for `` all about eve , '' `` gentlemen 's agreement , '' and `` how green was my valley , '' are also included . if you 're a classic movie buff , you do n't need to be told anything about `` all about eve , '' you will have already discovered it a long time ago . i do n't have to tell you how essential it is to add it to your dvd library , for you either have it already or have placed it on order -click `` add to cart '' now !
0	i bought this . it is sacriligious and nothing at all like the biblical story . it is immoral . i threw it in the trash because i did not want anyone else to see it
1	this is a very dark film . kevin reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a high school , but this picture has nothing in common with to sir with love . this is much more than a simple fairy tale . carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for samuel jackson
1	great movie excellent condition and as always shipped quickly and in good shape
1	i 've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd to ad to my collection . again , if you like bill murray you 'll like this movie . also , randy quaid is hilarious . murphys law at it 's best ! cracks me up just thinking about it
1	i like this tv series , better than the movie that movie was a disaster in all fronts , robert conrad is wonderful , & amp ; the cast is great
1	my husband , ex-military and combat veteran , does n't watch war movies , but a friend recommended this movie and , when it arrived , my `` man '' agreed to watch it with me . well , honey , what do you think ? he said : `` hollywood truly is a land of imagination and fantasy . '' i said : `` that was a good war movie . '' he said : `` that was not a war movie , it was a movie about personalities : there was no war in that movie . '' well , he 's right , but , i liked this movie , and , i think , most other people will to .
1	just got done watching the show and it was awesome . of course i had to download the tool , how else do you get started ? once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when i was ready . note to self get cable , dsl is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome . no commercials ! i did n't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it .
1	i recently read the fountainhead and atlas shrugged for the first time and found this version of the fountainhead to be the best old movie i 've seen . granted , i do n't watch a tremendous number of old movies , but i really enjoyed and recommend this movie
0	george segal is a good actor , but he is out of his element in this type of movie . he is much better in light-hearted movies like `` fun with dick and jane . '' the biggest disappointment is the dialog by harold pinter . the characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens , and we all get bored . this spy movie is not even in the same league with `` day of the jackel '' and `` the odessa file . '' i threw away my copy of `` the quiller memorandum '' after watching it once . i ca n't imagine ever wanting to see it again
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon . the quality . sure , you can watch it for free on cbs , but the quality is n't very good . it 's streamed and the bitrate ( quality ) is low . personally , i want to watch survivor on my 50 '' plasma , not on my computer screen . so , i use unbox + windows media center to make that happen . survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider .
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	good special effects for that time period . served its purpose to boost the morale of the american public during 1943 . the heroic acts by those in the u.s. military at that time should always be remembered . outgunned and outmanned they held their own , and then some on wake island and in the philippines . however , the writers and producer play it pretty loose as far as historical accuracy was concerned . no b-17s ever flew from hawaii to wake island and on to clark field in the philippines after the attack on pearl . i believe it is common knowledge that no b-17s ever sank the japanese fleet advancing on the philippines . remember colin kelly ? what was laughable was the scene where the mary ann makes an emergency landing on maui instead of hickam field on dec 7th . upon landing they 're fired upon by local island japanese . throughout the movie there are references to sabatoge committed by japanese americans in hawaii on dec 7th 1941 . upon landing at hickam field ( `` because the japs on maui were shooting at us '' ) a colonel goes on about japanese vegetable trucks driving onto the runway at hickam and crashing the tails of rows of p-40s before the attack . never happened . in truth , there were no acts of sabatoge committed by the japanese population in hawaii . this movie only serves to perpetuate the common belief that japanese-americans were disloyal and unpatriotic citizens during wwii , when in fact this was not the case . it should be noted that a good number of japanese-americans ( many of whom were thrown into prison camps after dec 7th ) died fighting for the united states during wwii in order to prove their loyalty to this country . may i suggest people watch the movie `` go for broke '' after watching air force to educate themselves on what `` really '' happened in wwii
0	infested ( josh olson , 2002 ) it 's really kind of impressive that a movie this bad does n't get shelved somewhere along the line . and yet here it is , in all its painfully cheesy glory , on my screen , daring me to turn it off . i almost gave in to the temptation , but i kept watching . for you , dear reader , so i can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here -- the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it . the story , what there is of it : a number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high-school buddies , who 's killed himself . there 's all the post-funeral bonding stuff , and everything 's looking remarkably big chill when things go horribly , horribly wrong thanks to vicious , genetically-altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers . yes , you got that right . as usual , the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor . any jo johnson plays the dead guy 's girlfriend ( well , ex , i guess ) , and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin . it is not , however , an out-and-out nude scene . sorry , guys . there is also the gorgeous lisa ann hadley ( general hospital/port charles ) , who 's really starting to look like kate hodge . ( this is a good thing . a very good thing . ) you 're certainly not watching for the special effects , ( amateur even by microbudget-indie standards ) , the acting ( atrocious ) , the script ( even worse ) , the direction ( competent at best ) , the cinematography ( ditto ) , the soundtrack ( cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago ) , or , really , anything else . so it 's got ta be the cheesecake . and that 's all well and good , but you can do that on fast-forward . i strongly suggest that route . at least you 'll waste less time on this . ( half
1	this film is frightening in a quiet sort of way ... i enjoyed it immensely . it was an especially scary watch , considering i was living an hour away from my military base in the backwoods of the thetford forest , in the east of england , in the middle of the night across from a patch of said spooky forest . delicious . the plot is solid , the special effects adequate to the story , the acting good . i like that it is so quiet , and brings a fairy-tale creature into the modern age so deftly , without the usual american hollywood theatrics . what would a military unit do if met by a group of supernatural beasts ? hmn ... this film offers a good answer . ( i do so like werewolves ! check out ginger snaps back -the prequel to the corny ginger snaps- it is also quiet . my inner 16-year-old liked it alot , as it is a bit on the young-female-empowerment side . watch for the scene that shows just how gutsy ginger is when faced with a jerk of a captain .
1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	i really enjoyed this movie however one of the more interesting parts of the movie was not fully developed . ian mckellen 's character was supposed to be homosexual ... ..he is in love with vincent perez 's character . it was a pretty subtle subplot in the movie and while i was watching it i was thinking ... .hmmmm is ian mckellen 's character gay ? i read roger ebert 's review of the movie on [ ... ] . in his article ebert says the movie could have been more interesting if this plot was further developed ... .i agree . i really enjoyed the movie but i thought ian mckellen 's character was very interesting and if his desires were further explored it could have turned this fairly ordinary romance movie into an extraordinary movie
1	if you like the typical teenage comedy , then you should give this movie a try . it does fall for some of the routine story lines that are in every movie like this , but it is still a funny movie . the best part is probably when they visit tom green 's grandparents . i never can get over the dog that talks , lol . overall , like i said , if you like teen comedies then you will like this movie . avoid it if you don '
1	this is a very funny movie and i honestly laughed so hard i was crying . had never even heard of any of the comedians except for jeff foxworthy , and i had only heard some of his `` you might be a redneck ... '' jokes . ron white is just plain down and out funny . his timing is wonderful , and you do n't get what you expect . you do laugh a lot , and you need to put down your beer before he starts talking , lest you blow it out your nose ! bill engval is the funniest comedian in this line up . if you do n't know bill 's work , watch the movie . you will become a fan . his 'here 's your sign ' stuff is funny , but has gotten like foxworthy 's 'you might be a redneck ... ' however , bill shines in that he can talk about anything at home , and have you rolling on the floor . i 've already heard almost all of the jokes in the movie . ron white and larry the cable guy basically do the same jokes they did on the `` blue collar comedy tour '' cd that came out at the end of 2000 . also , almost all of bill engvalls jokes were on that cd or his new comedy cd that came out late last year ( `` cheap drunk : an autobiography '' ) . most of jeff foxworthys jokes are not on a cd , but if you 've seen him live sometime during the last couple of years you 've heard almost all of them . actually , you can say that about all 4 guys . however , if you 've never heard of the 4 guys before or if you 've heard of them but never seen them live or heard any of their cd 's , then definitely go see this movie . the jokes are hysterical . then you can go and pick up the comedy cd 's and see them live . they have new jokes when you see them live . these guys , as a group and as individuals , are not stupid . you do n't get to where they are by being idiots , only by portraying them . they know what they are doing . this video is about laughing , about laughing really hard because they talk about things that have happened to us , things we have felt . life is sweet , life is beautiful , life can be ugly and hard , and , often , life , real life , is hilarious . and all those traits are n't isolate , they mix and mingle and complicate .
1	a documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes does n't seem to promise much , but the story of what was to turn out to be a real-life `` disaster movie '' is riveting stuff . terry gilliam 's obsession with `` don quixote '' is infectious and his enthusiasm for the task he faces coupled with glimpses of what it could have been really make you wish that things had turned out better . the insights into how a film is planned and the hugely complex logistics of a `` live shoot '' are fascinating , while the build-up to the almost inevitable collapse of the project , compounded by unbelievably bad weather and the illness of the central actor , coupled with the impacts of it all on those involved , is about as far removed from the typical self-congratulatory `` making of the movie '' add-on as you can get . finally , the whole sorry affair - in particular gilliam 's persistent unbridled optimism in the face of virtually insurmountable odds as he pursues the chance to realise a long-standing dream - becomes a quite bizarre , tragi-comic parallel to `` don quixote '' itself . you may only watch this once , and renting is therefore probably the best option , but you wo n't be disappointed .

1	koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s . the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u.s . naval academy , and doubtless those of other nations . the screenplay is based on a couple of novels , so there is some fiction , but the life of yi soon shin was well documented , so there 's plenty of fact supporting the story . if you are not familiar with korean drama , it 's good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product , but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-hollywood budgets involved , and it 's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told . it 's a long series , but presents an epic with power , depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode . it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon , such as `` seoul 1945 '' .
0	this is only a portion of this episode . it cuts off in the middle of a sentence
0	i would have given this film 0 stars if possible . this film was long , boring , and painful to watch . if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films , do not be deceived by this one ; it is nothing like those types of films
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised . normally , i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan . however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch . while the idea behind the movie is good , it could have been more entertaing , dramatic , or suspensful . as another reviewer remarked , i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else . but , i did suffer through to the end , where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
1	it 's flat out amazing -and utterly utterly unfair- that mark dacascos did n't become a huge star in 1993 when only the strong was released . it was released horrid reviews from leading critics ( i 'm looking at you roger ebert ! ! ! ! ) and managed to amass only $ 2 million in domestice gross . and for reasons that fail to make sense on any level , charlie 's angels : full throttle got to take in over $ 100 million . you must be joking . it 's nice to see capoeira , the brazilian martial art , to get such nice treatment . rarely do modern day kung fu movies specify the particular technique of the combatants , and capoeira is certainly deserving of some attention . like most martial arts movies , the story takes a backseat to the action , which is good in this case , since you would n't want any ditractions from mark 's many combat scenes , especially his duel with the evil silverio ( paco christian prieto ) . only the dumb would consider themselves a martial arts fan or mark dacascos fan if only the strong was n't in their collection
1	to begin with , i wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol ! that said , this is a rare case ( the 1st of its kind ? ) of a movie being better than the play it was based on . the general framework was of course the same , but in the play judy holliday 's part was taken by josephine hull , a very funny little old lady ( who also scored both on bway and on the screen in `` harvey '' and `` arsenic and old lace , '' to name the only 2 that i know of ) , and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges , it blossomed in the film . one problem , there simply were no witty lines , either in the play or the movie . this is odd for kaufman ( though the play was produced in 1953 , very late in his career ) , but about par for burrows ( early in his career ) . but still it was clever and interesting , the play had more structure than the movie ( typical of kaufman ) , but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play , which surprised me very much and made me wonder about kaufman . also the flick left out all the naughty words which i 'm sure hull barked out with delicious abandon ! ( note : kaufman co-wrote the play , burrows adapted it for the screen . ) this i think was more a sit-com than an actually witty kaufman comedy . and finally , judy holliday did not play a `` dumb blonde '' ! she only did that in `` born yesterday .
1	`` never say never again '' is a fantastic action thriller directed by irvin kershner . it is the remake of `` thunderball '' . however , it is still an enjoyable action packed adventure movie . sean connery plays his role brilliantly , despite his age ( 53 ) . this is vintage sean connery , an older , wiser and audacious man . he has not lost his touch with ladies . kim gives a good performance as the bad guy 's pal . barbara carrera performs her role as the sexy , clever and wicked fatima blush very well . klaus maria brandauer is also a remarkable villain while irvin kershner 's direction is commendable . rowan atkinson makes an interesting and amusing appearance . among some of my unforgettable scenes are the opening war-game teaser , the battle with lippe at shrublands , and a great motorcycle chase . despite his age , connery is surprisingly very fast , agile and very witty . the plot is sound and interesting . a spectre agent under the command of ernst blofeld infiltrates a us air force base located in the united kingdom and steals two tomahawk cruise missiles . james bond must find them before they are detonated . the characterization is superb and i liked the ending .
1	special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out , but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment . welcome to delos , vacation spot of the future , where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true . you may choose westworld , romanworld , and meadevilworld ! you can , for $ 1000.00 a day ( 1974 prices ) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it 's all set up to please you and you ca n't get hurt . of course if that were true then we have no movie . soon after the latest batch of people get to the park , the robots begin to have breakdowns , like a virus ( i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as `` to far out there , no one will believe it '' wonder if they still think so ) . james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest . the final chase ( with evil robot yul brynner , still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths ) is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad . a very fun movie
1	truly a great film by sam peckinpah with warren oates performing masterfully . it starts out somewhat slow and builds the plot til oates is out for revenge in peckinpah fashion ! look for kris kristofferson as a bad guy biker who gets his just deserves ; also gig young and robert webber as a couple cold ruthless hitmen out to get the prize for their boss . note that the mexican land baron is the same fellow who played the general in peckinpah 's `` wild bunch '' . all in all a great film full of action and revenge as only sam peckinpah could do it ! i saw this as a teenager on `` telecinema '' in the 70 's ( the original pay-per-view ! ) and it is just as powerful now as ever . they do n't make movies like this anymore
0	this is one of the most boring films i ever watched . there is nothing erotic in it . the whole story is perverted with a poor , innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various `` lovers '' she is introduced . i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her , but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others , who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings
1	arnold schwarzenegger stars as detective john kimble , a man who has been chasing a drug dealer named cullen crisp . when he finally tracks crisp down , he learns that the only way he can put crisp away is by having his ex-wife testify against him . kimble finds out the name of the school crisp 's son attends . he is then assigned a new partner , phoebe o'hara , who is going to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher , and the two travel to astoria , oregon . unfortunately for kimble , o'hara becomes ill , and the only person who can take her place is him .
1	this is the first time that i thought a movie was not worth seeing and waited until it hit a premium movie channel . this time i will admit i made a mistake . this movie was fun to watch . it is well written and the interactions of the two main actors show a great chemistry . nicolas cage plays the special agent in charge of the secret service detail guarding a former first lady . the first lady is played well my shirley maclaine . the agent feels he is wasted in such a detail and wants desperately to get back on detail to the white house ... and the first lady wants him to stay . the two seem to thrive on confrontation with each other . she does her best to break every procedure the secret service is supposed to follow . if you pay attention in the movie you will see why the first lady actually loves the agent so much and wants him with her . and i think the picture shows us a very accurate relationship that occurs between agent and his protectee . though it could be seen as a comedy ; there is a just enough drama and a mystery which cage character solves . a very well directed with perfect pace and timing . i look forward to buying it and watching it again .
1	this was my first download and it was `` free '' . the download performed well . `` the mystery of edgar allan poe '' was informative . it ran up to 50 minutes . this was a unbox video download . it started with the typical intro and ended with the credits . some individuals did not get a complete download so i included my experience with the unbox download . i hope the review was helpful . ty
0	after watching the newest version on television , this one did n't measure up . the movie did n't make you want to watch more . there was no romance compared to the latest version
1	this episode of star trek , `` the man trap '' is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise . truthfully , `` the man trap '' terrified me ( i was maybe two , or three , although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it 's third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time ) ; star trek was considered `` adult programming '' , and as such i was not allowed to watch it - i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house , then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i 'd seen , but excited just the same . like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by ( lost in space ) , i did n't recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in , but remained frightened of anyhow ( i was , as i said , very young ) .
1	charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as england 's king , henry the eigth , who infamously married six different queens , divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted . the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs , touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn , concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty , capacious king . laughton , as ever , is a marvel , skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout , and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity . viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point : this is all about the cleverly-rendered script , which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads , and on the classy ensemble acting , which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print ( i 'm writing in the year 2003 ; perhaps criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon ) . still , fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot
1	a new documentary film that won the 2005 grand jury prize at the sundance film festival now in nationwide release features a warning from this nation 's 34th president about the unwarranted influence on u.s. foreign policy from the nation 's numerous military contractors and is gaining praise from civil libertarians across the nation as that influence on world affairs is still obvious to all of us in today 's times . the film is called `why we fight , ' a title the documentary filmmaker took from a series of world war 2 propaganda films made by frank capra . it opens with the january 17 , 1961 farewell address to the country by president dwight eisenhower who was about to turn over the keys to the white house to a young newcomer named john kennedy . the remarks made by the outgoing chief executive from the oval office was the last talk to the nation by the one time five-star army general before returning to private life . what 's interesting in the speech is the candor he exhibited about what he believed to be the growing cozy relationship between military suppliers and those politicians in congress who liked to keep the constituents in their districts happy with large contracts for the making of weapons and supplies . that , in turn , would keep those contractors and the leaders in the military pleased because they would keep getting improved weapons to counter the growing cold war threat they believed they faced from the soviet union . the phrase ike used , `the military-industrial complex , ' has since become synonymous with the growing influence by military weapon suppliers on eager politicians wanting campaign donations for their coffers and jobs for their districts and the eagerness of those politicians to keep purchasing more and more weapons from these same suppliers . it 's obvious the world war 2 hero who commanded the allied military invasion of europe that defeated nazism knew what he was talking about when he warned his fellow citizens that `we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military industrial complex . ' unfortunately , for us citizens who believe a rising police state has developed in the four decades since . eisenhower is considered by many of today 's historians as an amiable military dunce who only knew how to operate in an army setting so let the political experts in his administration make the decisions to run this country in his eight years in office in a similar fashion to that of a highly successful corporate ceo letting his underlings run the show while he spends most of his time visiting stockholders in cheerleading sessions to keep their stock value high . but it 's now apparent that he was much shrewder than originally believed in his dealings with congress and the military bureaucracy he found in washington during his tenure and what he felt was a growing threat against the unique political power of the president in setting american foreign policy and what the military need for defense . the ninety-eight minute film then uses interviews with contemporary figures as diverse as gore vidal , john mccain , richard perle and william kristol to showcase the filmmakers opinion that we still have too many americans believing that the concept of never-ending war is good for the american economy and our nation 's foreign policy goals that is transposed with historic footage and material regarding why we are currently in the conflict in faraway iraq . dwight eisenhower recognized the horrors of war and his farewell warning to the american people and his successors not to be taken in by those who promote the perpetual re-armament of our military so we can always be stronger than our perceived enemies still resonates with great force today . it 's a sad commentary that in the forty-five years since he left office with that dire prediction that so few of our politicians chose to listen .
1	this is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by amicus studios in the early 70 's . ( i.e . `` tales from the crypt '' , `` the house that dripped blood '' , `` vault of horror '' ) .each anthology is held together by a certain theme . in `` asylum '' a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient . the young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the asylum . if he is correct , he gets the job . the stories give the feel of old horror comics , which inspired many horror anthologies . the characters are one-dimensional and driven by such deadly sins , as greed and lust . in most cases , with a twist and a touch of macabre , the fates get their revenge on the evil-doers . the stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre . the british countryside , where the stories are mostly set , adds an extra chill . the movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies , such as hbo 's `` tales from the crypt '' or stephen king 's `` creepshow '' , and the movies noted earlier . it would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out . more general audiences would be entertained , but i do n't think this movie should be ranked with 5-star horror masterpieces ( `` the exorcist '' , `` halloween '' , `` psycho '' ) , nor would i expect most general audiences to rank it so highly . the dvd quality is definitely noteworthy , having sharp , rich colors which enhanced the movie 's experience .
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	this episode embodies why i love this series . the bad guy is bad - and makes appearances throughout the series . and now , this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs . now you really do n't know what to think ... except that today is a day of honor . i wo n't blow it for you . watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample ... and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci-fi adventures .
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
0	from the cover , this movie looked like a fun mixture of cruel intentions and metropolitan . no such luck . i think the biggest problem in this movie was the script -- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue . though there are some normally fine actors in this cast , it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script , and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion , except for a few moments of melodrama . i found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with . delilah , who is supposed to be the `` fun , crazy '' outsider , simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie 's central party . even the art direction in this movie was strange -- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away . the strangeness of this movie is not intentional , it 's just lack of skill . stay away
1	prince 's 1986 romantic comedy `` under the cherry moon '' finally received the dvd treatment it deserved in the summer of 2004 . when the film was released , it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent . of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy . the acting may be full of flaws but it 's the 80 's , what do you expect ? prince and jerome benton , from the time , are gigolos living it up in south france and they come across a beautiful heiress ( kristin scott thomas ) who happens to get her trust fund on her 21st birthday . they both woo her for the money but prince ends up catching feelings for her . with a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack , `` under the cherry moon '' fails to disappoint
1	this version of pride and prejudice takes quite a few liberties with jane austen 's most beloved story , but manages to endear itself in spite of that . olivier 's darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with colin firth or matthew macfadyen , but he does so well that you 'll be charmed by him in no time . and greer garson 's lizzy is as spirited as you could wish . the costumes are all wrong , yes , and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in regency dramas , but once you get over that , and immerse yourself into the story , you 'll be swept away . highly recommended
1	the fly is fantastic and well worth a watch . goldblum 's performance is also just outstanding . for a really cool , creepy , interesting and engaging film , this is the one . fly 2 , not so good . so dont bother . the extras and presentation on the dvd is also great , adding to the package here . definately worthwhile if a little cronenberg splat isnt gon na offend and watching what could have been a really tacky , cheap project done really , really well sounds good . and if it doesnt , get over yourself , cause it is
0	the languages and images do n't connect . we were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value , but instead the entire dvd does n't offer it . the other dvds in this collection are great . this one failed to teach anything
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show . even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed - incorrectly - as there is no shania performance on the dvd . as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal - sorry ! !
0	the only seen that i like is where he had crap all over the walls of the bathroom and bob saget went crazy yelling
0	i was n't expecting disney , but i was less than thrilled by this feature . i 'm assuming there 's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70 's that took the whole 'stoner ' heavy metal thing and ran with it . many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story . i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything , but i could n't get through this whole film
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book . the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you do n't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny , droning music .
0	i was livid when i saw this movie after reading the book . it is barely on course with the book . they could have done a much better job with that story . what a waste of good actors like denzel and salli richardson .
0	this is one creative way in which to recoup some of the loss incurred by buying this nightmare . if you are one of the unfortunate who rent this waste of time ( like i was ) recommend that your local video store make one empty space on their shelves and toss this loser . this 71 minute `` experience '' , which feels more like 100 days of viewing hell , is nothing more then a montage of artsy , disjoined , surreal scenes . it quickly becomes boring after the first 5 minutes , tedious after 10 minutes , and downright irritating at around 15 minutes . i actually made the mistake of suffering through to the end , hoping that something magical would happen to make everything half-way understandable . this film could only appeal to the rare , artistically elite , filmgoer who finds anything as superficial as character development or cumbersome as plot layout simply uninspiring
1	ever since the `` colorizing '' debate of a generation ago , this question has been asked over and over again . and we 've finally settled it , i hope . this dvd gives the viewer options of seeing it in the way it was originally released or with the ending created by its maker . like everybody else , i 'd only seen the `` chopped '' version , labelled by some here as `` surreal . '' well , there were plenty of other `` surreal '' elements throughout the original , most epsecially the surreal premise that ralph meeker was an actor . however , i would urge even the purists among you to take a very , very close look at the `` intended '' ending . it adds so much to what came before , and helps us understand the childlike attitudes we had towards this weaponry we 'd just been the first to use in the name of world peace . this new era was far from innicent , but we were like children with the power we had . a great film , now made even better for history
1	when foxfire first came out , i had no interest to watch it at all . recently i became a huge angelina jolie fan . the main reason to watch the movie was her . jolie is great as usual . she gives everything into her character and is very good . the reason that films like these do n't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled . and while the generalization about most `` female bonding '' films is true , the same could be said about the men . and what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters . the plot is based on real life situations , and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch . the girls are learning life lessons , growing up , experimenting , facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other . angelina jolie has some brilliant lines and poses as an almost mother-like figure , affecting their lives forever , sheltering and explaining , and persuading the girls to take an extra risk , or risks , rather . it 's very intimate and she does an incredible job playing `` legs '' . it is n't meant to represent what all girls do , and do n't bother looking for a movie about lesbians guys . it gets very ethereal at points and made a point about bonding and unity . do n't bother looking for deep intellectual comments either , because the most poignant scenes are sullen and the actresses use their eyes over words . the opening scenes are good , the way they introduce the oppressed victims , and you see the wide-eyed looks as are often given by people who are afraid - but who will later look for comfort in legs and her new-found posse . it is all set up very well . and the touching ending scenes provide closure , showing how very real , and sincere , everything has been . it 's not sugar coated in any way and let 's you take a glimpse into a female perspective that does not revolve around whether or not they have a boyfriend , and whether their hair and make-up look okay . and if at least 1 girl can watch a movie like that , or read a book like that , and be inspired enough to raise her self-esteem and not let anyone walk over her , then it has made a good impact . after all , it 's simply not often movies about self-proclaiming girls rebelling get in this much of a spotlight , right ?
0	if you were hoping for a skin flick , this is not it . a couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at julie mccullouh ( ... ) , in bed , is not enough too qualify . the acting is awful . angie looks great for her age . still not enough
0	`` cyrano '' is one of the greatest verse plays ever written . unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano . he 's a great , clumsy side of beef , not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac . with the best will in the world , his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance . the english translation was especially commissioned for this film . it is undistinguished , prosy and dull . it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore . get the jose ferrer version . this one 's a dog
1	a group of male pals are at the wedding of a friend . when he gets married , jerry o'connell , ( as `` michael '' ) and the rest of the men agree to never get married , be single and be a `` tomcat '' . horatio sanz ( as `` steve '' ) agrees too , but the next thing they know , he gets married too . michael and steve are still friends . everytime michael meets a woman , bad luck happens and he gets in trouble with thugs or the law . he 's a innocent as can be . horatio sanz ( nbc 's saturday night live ) is hilarious and a delight in this film . billy hufsey plays a `` pit boss ''
0	this movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold . martin does a great job with nick nolte as an artist in `` life lessons '' and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching ford coppolas somthing zoe i began to tire and by the end of woody allens snoozefest i was bored stiff . my advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off . the first 30 minutes is great film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film .
0	i just read doug 's review of `` first man into space '' and i just had to write respond . i was seven years old when i saw this movie . as i recall ( though my recollection here may be faulty ) , it was double-billed with `` tom thumb . '' one of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies . `` first man into space '' scared the bejeezus out of us . we were so scared we could n't stop crying . they had to take us out of the movie in the middle -- sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper . i thus never saw its conclusion . a few years ago i found the video of the movie and i triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers . needless to say , they made fun of me throughout the movie : `` dad , you were scared by this ? ! '' : -
1	this is the first series of upstairs , downstairs . chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a belgravia townhouse , updown , as it is affectionately known , covers about twentyfive years . the first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908 . it introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle , barring a few later additions to the caste . most of this first series concerns the career of sarah , who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode . we also see the early stages of the career of elizabeth bellamy , daughter of the house , as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents . some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white , due to a cameramen 's strike . i find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs . some of the episodes are a bit off target , especially the swedish tiger , which is just plain weird , but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed . the first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 eaton place
1	loved this dvd because it 's useful on so many levels for my spanish class . can use it for cultural discussions of music , social issues , history of cuba , current policies toward cuba , etc . most expecially , kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving . also , for the beginning student , many of the singers ' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east ( mainly china 's ) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy . yi soon shin , however , is a rare exception . not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the chosun political factions ( and the second-guessing nature of the king ) which causes his eventual death . also , the special effects are great . the battle scenes ( whether on sea or land ) are realisitic and of outstanding quality . the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china . then again , this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral . also , the entire selection should have 104 episodes . i do n't know why it stops at 101 . if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject , try samuel hawley 's imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources ) . any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion ( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun : total war by creative assembly ( now in gold version ) .
0	i just had my two and a half year old son evaluated as having si . the therapist recommended this book . i found other reviews interesting and was immediately put off by the cover i am looking for whatever positive help i can get . i wish more was known about this condition . or that i knew of a support group as i do n't have any family who live anywhere close around me . my son has an amazing memory and is very lively and outgoing . he also has extreme tantrums and throws things and seemed to get really fustrated so some of the si checklist definetly applyed and made sense . he also is very keyed into me and i ca n't even get in the shower or go to the bathroom without him getting upset . some of what they state did n't seem to fit him though like he crawled and walked early and seemed to have good co-ordination eating with a spoon or fork ? my husband and i definetly need to understand how to try and change or help things in the home situation . i think it was a bad marketing move to create the cover they did as it creates such a negative reaction
1	this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it . i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view
0	this is not one for the uncoordinated . i only tried it once , and have no desire to try it again . also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space .
0	the movie is great but the cd is defective . it keeps on getting stuck on the same spot . i 'm trying to return it but i ca n't get any reply to my e-mails
0	with as many big names in this i thought it would be amazing ... .well , it is a corn ball adventure..its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up , flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and poses ! ! ( shakes head ) its things like this that really hurt the film for many kung fu/hong kong film fans . i really wanted to like this film but could n't get past the ridiculousness of it . now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish
0	man oh man ... i love documentaries and character studies . crumb , capturing the friedmans , the thin blue line etc ... but this ... my god , the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to `` love '' or `` get '' this horrible mess . over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep . the two women in question are `` big edie '' and `` little edie '' , the aunt and cousin of jackie o respectively . let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you ; little edie : i hate it here . i had to leave new york to come here and take care of my mother . big edie : i was fine . i used to have a lovely singing voice . little edie : but i missed out on my big chance to make it . big edie : oh well . you missed out . little edie : i miss new york . i hate it here . big edie : did you feed the cats ? little edie ; yes ! ! ! i fed them ! ! ! big edie : i used to have a lovely singing voice . now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes . do yourself a favor ; before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients . you 'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time . horrible . just plain horrible
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	people actually gave this movie 5 stars ! are they for real ? if you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you . it is fun to watch , but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking . it is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are . their are so many scar face ripoffs it 's offencive , and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said `` okay , we do n't have much film left , we got ta ' rap this up real quick . dmx , find religion ... and cut . '' rent the movie , try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying , ignore the horrible acting of naz , then return it . and when you review it please do n't give it five stars , those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop , not just some `` phat movie you and some down ass playas ' watched while moms was outta ' da ' house .
0	because there were so many great reviews for this movie , i decided to go out and rent this film and watch it . i was bored to death watching this film , and whats with the words `` what 's wrong '' kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice ? those words and that voice really annoyed me ! why does this place have not one person with hair ? now , i 'm not trying to be raciest here , but what 's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v. , well i can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up . what 's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate ? was he supposed to be gay ? i guess this film is way to so called `` artsy '' for me . what i know is that this film is boring , and when it comes to ending , you do n't know what happends to the guy at the end . the film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway . this film makes the movie the village exciting to watch . i wish that i could give my money back
1	this is by far the best movie that i have seen that portrays the real life of a gypsy . though it is not a documentary , but you will learn a lot about the gypsy way of life , their music , and most of all flamenco in a very beautiful and touching story . your breath will be taken away from the very first scene . awesome sights and awesome music . what can i say ! tomatito performs one of his most beautiful heart-felt solo accompanied with a group of arabic musicians . this heavenly moment alone is the reason what makes life so beautiful and precious .
0	set against the backdrop of the spanish civil war , `` talk of angels '' could have been provocative and sweeping , but it settles for little more than standard-issue governess falls for the rich guy romance . vincent perez has a smoldering presence , but the beautiful polly walker is as flat on screen as a fascist protest poster . the two have little chemistry . the result : a stilted and perfunctory outing . the only saving grace is the always wonderful frances mcdormand , whose hard-bitten , love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest
1	i rented this movie about three years ago and fell in love with it . i recently purchased it as a chritsmas gift for myself . i loved it
1	great casting , dancings and performance . well , if you keep abusing yourself , nobody can save you . this so talented broadway genius simply could n't himself to mess up many women 's lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself , chain-smoking , addicting to prescriptioned drugs , sleeping around , hopping from one woman to another . he created so many personal disasters around himself , dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself . burning his own life candle from both ends day and night . when the curtain in the theatre falls , it would go up again in the next evening , but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you , it wo n't go up again . a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz
1	this movie gave me constipation that the gods have never seen ! not to mention uncontrolable vomiting . when i was a young russian jewish boy , before i moved to my navite japan , i had a pet lizard named ruby . i loved to pet his long hairy back while i fed him seaweed and chives . he always loved cilantro ( on the side ) . have i ever told you about my uncle clair ? he was 5'6 '' and 423 lbs . and wore a 48 ddd bro ( tm ) . oops ! i droped my match ! i have to go . my parrot is on fire
1	for every season , there is a classic movie . in our house , `` a christmas story '' tops the list when christmas rolls around . without a doubt this movie is a classic ! ralphie and his quest for the red ryder bb gun -- i do love this movie .
1	freddy krueger is held in hell after being killed by his daughter.all evidence of his existence have been taken out of his hometown.as far as elm street is concerned freddy never existed.he is unable to return and wreak havoc.freddy is able to free jason voorhess from hell.jason almost immediately takes up his machete and starts killing freddy 's children . jason starts killing too frequently for freddy 's taste and he is forced to make a return to stop jason . upon the return of freddy the viewer is treated to a battle royal of the two forces of evil.the knife glove of freddy against the machete of jason makes for some exciting fighting.the final battle finally is settled on a peir on a lake.the two most evil people on earth cut each other to peices . you think that you have a victor in this classical battle but the final scene leaves you wondering who really won this fight.i believe that they left the movie open for a sequel.fans of `` a nightmare on elm street '' and `` friday the thirteenth '' will be greatly entertained
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	this is definitely screwball . forget about anything resembling emotional reality , this movie tromps along it 's own gay way . a lot of the humor comes from the absurd manner cary and irene skip along in their own little la-la land of wealth , suspicion , and inzaniness . maybe not for everyone , but cary gives one of his classic , clueless performances
1	this book is not about the grand strategy of war nor is it specifically about the heroic actions of its author , audie murphy , who was , of course , america 's most decorated soldier of world war ii . on the contrary , the book is about the war as seen up close and personal by those who actually fought it in the foxholes , on the roads and in the forests , and many times on the open battle fields of north africa and europe . it is a remarkable book which puts the reader right in the middle of the action , right there with the bone-weary dog faces wallowing in the mud at the bottom of their fox holes , right there with them as they slog toward the battle lines with trucks passing them bearing the corpses of those who went before . and , if the reader listens carefully to their gallows humor , he or she can hear them joke with one another as they try to calm their nerves and still their fears . then , he or she can hug the ground right beside them as they are shelled by mortars and artillery or raked by machine gun fire and watch as the soldier , whom he or she has almost come to know , is picked off by a concealed sniper or killed by a mortar blast . in other words , this book is about war and the men who fight it . if i had to recommend one book by means of which a reader could fully understand what it is truly like to be a combat infantryman , this would be the one .
1	colin firth is the quinessential mr. darcy ! this film captures the depth and essence of jane austen 's novel in such a beautiful , classic way . it is worlds better than the recent keira knightley version , whose weak interpretation of the role of lizzie made me appreciate jennifer ehle even more
0	i think a lot of the high scores given to this movie were based on emotion and patriotism . however , judged purely on its cinematic merits , this movie is simply not very good . the premise is excellent , and if properly executed , the movie could have been superb , but it rapidly turns into an endless barrage of cartoonish cliches that have all been done countless times ( and better ) in movies like the dirty dozen . see if any of these concepts seem familiar : gather a rag tag team of misfits , take them to a secluded training site where they are quickly and miraculously turned into dedicated , disciplined fighters ( in this case by chopping down trees and carrying poles around ... .the navy seals must have it all wrong ) . their mission suffers several immediate reversals ( usually due to the `` evil '' government ) , but the team members all bravely vote to continue anyway , improvising as they go . naturally , a couple are killed ( usually the big and/or ugly ones ) , but the majority emerge relatively unscathed and victorious ( to a crescendo of soul-stirring music ) . this movie may indeed have been loosely based on real events , but i absolutely positively guarantee you that the way the real soldiers looked , acted , and prepared for the mission bears no , and i mean no , resemblance to this gaggle of ninnies . indeed , superficial , formulaic , laughably simplistic movies like this are not only a disservice to heroic reality , they are an insult . check out the perfect haircut and snow white teeth on the prisoner rescued last ( robert stack 's `` son '' ) ... .ridiculous ! ! ! it 's a shame that an accurate movie could not have been made about the real mission , instead of this silly , sanitized , trite visualization . one last question : what is the net gain in sacrificing four people to save four people ? is this really a `` victory '' ? buy it , rent it , watch it if you must ... .then see whose review hits this cliched nail on the head
0	tepid entry in the collection . lorre 's moto a bit of a bore
1	i have watched this movie probably 50-60 times , and each time i watch it i love it more . i think this is woody at his best , with a great cast and an amazing performance by nick `` apollo '' forte . except for his `` earlier , funny '' films , which are in a class by themselves , this film has the perfect balance of comedy , drama , dry wit , `` suspense '' , larger-than-life characters ... .reminds me of `` raging bull '' ... but that 's a whole 'nuther genre . as much as i love `` annie hall '' , sometimes it seems dated and hard to watch ... .but `` bdr '' is timeless . do like i did , if you ca n't decide whether to put down the cash right off the bat ... rent it , watch it , and buy it . i know you will . bravo , woody ! now , what happened to the rest of your films ... ? ?
0	i 've taken kickboxng classes and have owned other kickboxing dvds but did not like this one . its boring , kathy seems to be doing a number of the moves in an awkward manner and the other people on set are distracting -- from their outfits to their sloppy moves . skip this one
0	i purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was pg that it would be fine . also , the market for transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere . wow , were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie . these were not just words like shoot or dang , but the real deal . i remember transformers when i was growing up and i certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons . i am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking . who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office . concerned in alabam
0	kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever . he looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good . unfortunately , his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad . i wo n't explain the story , it is cops vs. drug dealers . there is a beautiful fighting female , good car chases , big name stars , and good fights . how did this movie go wrong ? well , stanley tong is a decent director , but he is a stuntman , screen fighter , and martial arts choreographer at heart . he tries to make this an american movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies . i cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film i have seen in a long time . usually , i am able to get past all of this since i am a sucker for good fight scenes , and this movie does have a few . highlights to watch for are ken lo vs. marc dacoscos and dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight . the thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes , but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie . 'cradle to the grave ' has a better end fight ! stanley tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale , coolio ends up as the main opponent . not ken lo who is the leg fighter that faces jackie chan at the end of 'drunken master 2 ' , and not marc dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors , but coolio . i honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie , but the final fight sequence is just horrible . stanley tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight . it is just too bad coolio had to ruin it . 2.5/5 dvd from dimension home video has good sound and picture quality . no special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie .
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	peter dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of a stranger comes to town , but that 's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable . as finn , a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in newfoundland , nj , dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back , never begging the audience 's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger , hurt , bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes . ( his rumbly , seductive voice does n't hurt either . ) as a local resident with a tragic past , patricia clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters ( and provides some of the film 's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her suv ) , with stellar support from a garrulous bobby cannavale and a luminous michelle williams . settle into the film 's gracious , generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely wonderful
1	movies was good however the quality of the film was not very good . screen was very cloudy at times and it was hard to see some things and the sound was not very good . the story it self was moving. -- -thk
0	this is what happens when you buy movies that amazon recommends ; i consider my extreme boredom with this movie my punishment for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy . do n't let the fantastic cast lure you ; this movie is boring ! true , it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends -- more often than not -- do n't necessarily go anywhere , and oftentimes the texture of a movie is -- not in the conversations themselves -- but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations , but nevertheless do not waste your money on this movie . did i mention that it was boring
1	once again , fox has cancelled a brilliant show . while it is occasionally a bit off-color , the dialogue is brilliant , but apparently people could n't follow the episodes , so no one watched this great show , and it was cancelled . i have n't tried the download option , but i highly recommend the show
1	once in a while , movie gem reaches out and touches your soul . i have added this film to my collection of favorites , and those i will savor when i need a gut wrenching cry . i was literally emotionally drained after watching it . the story is set in hell 's kitchen , among the despair of poverty and addictions . a young irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life ... .overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old . i find myself drawn in the family , deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs . one scene had me on the edge of my seat ... .at a street fair when the father is trying to win an et doll for his youngest daughter . i wo n't tell you the outcome . the youngest daughter , ariel , has a spirit about her , a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family . she is bold and unafraid , yet she yearns for the love of her father , who is emotionally distant following the death of his son . the oldest daughter , kristine , is wise beyond her years . she successfully camptures life on her camcorder , which she uses constantly , almost a video diary if you will . the mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart . her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life , also , and she struggles to deal with that . she is the glue which binds her family together . their neighbor , the `` screaming man '' of the building , is a tormented young artist . the words on his door say it all `` keep away '' . i wo n't give away the plot with his role . a must see ... ..i cried , i stopped for a bit , i cried again . i could n't stop crying . okay , so i cried at lion king , too ... but that 's beside the point . i loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after , with red puffy eyes . she understands .
1	where are the dvds ? i 'm still waiting ! i want it all , but especially the second season . i 'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc . i want good quality discs , not too many episodes on each , please . however , i 'll take what i can get . just put it on dvd , please !
0	the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good . in fact , it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we do n't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious . according to the rumor ( the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates ) she was , however , but we the audience do n't know that . however , the young woman is quick to think she has been raped . why there is no attempt at a physical exam , is unexplained , especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin , however it turns out she is n't , so that 's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes . fortunately , we 're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies , either , so this does n't turn into a soap opera . however , we do have the dreamboat `` hero '' who dreams up the rumor about her being raped , and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout . but that 's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable , being insufferably full of themselves . the last half of the film , 'dreamboat ' takes the turn as lead character , and it 's his story we 're following , whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film , and basically it 's her introduction to the audience of all the characters . turns out 'dreamboat ' and the young woman victim have a history together ; which means issues they have to work out , and everyone else ( in a way , the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement ) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth , though the characters do n't have the same truth in mind - it 's about vengeance ; not justice . and vengeance when it 's not the comic book variety , is n't fun for an audience , it 's just distasteful . in other words , the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves , and left the rest of us alone . so from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment ? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever . there is merely too much story , so it becomes ridiculous . a basically good premise is ruined . if you are a fan of any of the stars involved , it might be worth viewing , if only once , but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth . perhaps that 's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip , or in this case deliberate lies , is that what goes around comes around , and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach . i almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway , but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once , just to be sure where this is headed
0	the first film was much better than r.e . apocalypse ; more gore , better acting , better presentation overall , and it was done with a lot less money
0	this is certainly the worst movie that elvis had anything to do with , unless you count the final televised which can be just as disturbing and difficult to watch at this `` atomic '' bomb . i enjoyed seeing the sweet little anissa jones , john carradine , dabney coleman , and vincent price , but beyond that this movie is absolutely unbearable . please avoid even viewing it . bottom of the trash can , literally
0	this is absolutely no improvement on the poor vhs video tape . a travesty . i subtract all stars for the terrible transfer , menu , and options .
0	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work , yes the `` martial arts '' are weak at best , but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top . why do they still call me a warlord ? and mad ? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier . not for power , not for evil , but for good . carlos blanka will be the first of thousands . they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary , every creed , every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica . and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude .
0	this has to be dolph 's suckiest movie . i 'm a huge fan , and i own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis . but do not buy this movie , save your money and buy one of dolph 's better movies like army of one or men of war . personally though i 'm pumped for the release of masters of the univers
1	once again , fox has cancelled a brilliant show . while it is occasionally a bit off-color , the dialogue is brilliant , but apparently people could n't follow the episodes , so no one watched this great show , and it was cancelled . i have n't tried the download option , but i highly recommend the show
1	this movie is wonderful . although it did n't exactly make me cry , it did touch me in a sentimental way . i fell in love with morrie . he is such a sweet guy , and his story is an inspiration to everyone . i was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life , even though fate had handed him a death sentence . he made up his mind that he was n't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself ; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible , and i really admire that . i was also pleased with the effect morrie had on his old college student , mitch . mitch learns to appreciate life 's little surprises , and to not be in such a big rush all the time . he learns to relax and smell the roses , to let go of old grudges , to value the people in his life , and he even learns to allow himself to cry . my most favorite scene is where mitch actually breaks down and bawls , and morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other . this scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film . although it 's the last time that mitch ever sees morrie alive , it 's still very sweet and poignant . the ending is pretty sad , but it 's also happy at the same time . morrie is gone , yet his legacy lives on . i recommend this movie to anyone , of any gender , of any age .
1	every time i was flipping the channels and dutch was on i would end up staying on the channel and watching it . i hated married with children so i was very suprised that i like this movie
1	i got the dvd in a timely manner and the quality is great . great service
