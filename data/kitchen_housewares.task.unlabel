I have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she didn't get her way, she was becoming intolerable, barking at all hours of the night, disturbing everyone around. She is extremely fragile, with a heart condition, and I felt a shock collar could kill her. I will admit I was very skeptical about this spray collar but I was desperate, anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train. So I tried the collar, and I am very happy to report it works, Tallys barking has returned to its normal level, which was infrequent, it happened quickly, within a few days, we followed the directions on the box, which are very important, and had good results. I can't promise this will work for every dog, but it worked well for ours,without resorting to shocks. I don't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work, although I do ocassionaly with Tally to refresh her training, I feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions, and you will get results fairly quickly. I am quite satisfied with this product 
He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again! It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why. When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long. It does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker. Terriers are just too stubborn to care if they're getting sprayed, I guess. 
The Premier collar was the best solution to help my dog restrain from barking without any injury to him!! He learned within a few days while on walks to stop barking at other dogs, when wearing the collar. I didn't want to use the shock method, but my groomer told me about the Premier Citronella collar to aid in his training. We got good results! 
Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered. I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all. They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless. Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged. Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless. 
I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs 
I thought I'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix. I did not want to try a shock collar, but I was concerned that this collar would be too large for her (she's only 8 lbs). Although it looks a little large, she doesn't appear uncomfortable at all. And WOW did this work! The spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark - immediately. After the first 2-3 days, she is barking less in general and doesn't have to wear the collar all that often. It's been 5 days, and I don't think she will need to wear it forever. This product has been a total lifesaver, and my dog is happy too. 
This is a great product. We have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people, kids, bikes, dogs and pretty much anything. We use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car. We still use the collar once in awhile. We are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach. So far we like it a lot 
This item did not work when I got it. I returned it to Zelco, who informed me that it was my error, they did not do refunds, and returned it to me. I had a previous model Zelco that worked great for 10-15 years. It had a switch. This new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off. Gr 
I've used the Itty Bitty Booklight for years. The 2nd edition is a welcome improvement. It's much easier to turn on/off, and the light stays in place after months of use. (The light on the Original Model tends to swivel after time. 
Dear Customer Service, I am please about the refund; I am please about all thinks that I purchase from you. The web page where I bought: Zelco "itty bitty" Book Light, Volume 2 I believe is not clear. By looking the page I had the impression that I was going to buy a mini lamp where I was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a LED lamp. At list this was my impression. Sincerely, Adrian 
I actually purchased this book light so that I can read while I wait for my child to sleep. he likes me to be in the room. This was perfect. Does not put out enough light to bother my son, but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while I wait for him to fall asleep 
I own two that include the ac adapter. They are great bright lights. I used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily. Replacement bulbs are not hard to find. Don't bother paying for high priced Zelco bulbs. I bought my generic replacements at Walmart in the area they sell flashlights. I use rechargeable batteries. They probably last 8-10 hours on a fresh charge, maybe longer. I've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period. I put it on the visor. The lights are very bright. In some circumstances they might be too bright, but that would be a weird complaint for a light, huh 
This book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person. I use it with the converter so I can plug it into the wall , but the battery adapter works well for travel. I have also used it to read in the car. I wish the wiring was a little heavier, as this was where my former light failed, but it lasted for several years with regular use 
I bought this light for my wife several months ago. There have been absolutely no problems, and it even seems to be holding up better than my original itty bitty book light. I would get this one for myself if I decide to get another one, but I'm also checking out the flourescent one, which is supposed to never need a new bulb, and you can hardly find the bulbs for the regular ones anymore, unless you go to Zelco's website 
O.K., buy this poster if you like spooky things but don't say you were not warned. You are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around. This is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books. The movie encompasses several of the first books of the series. And the poster is indicative of both. You will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster. I suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box. Placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum). Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count. Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them. It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count 
I bought this bark stop because my neighbor has a pit bull that stays out 24/7 barking, and the shared fence is about 15 feet from my bedroom window. The dog barks so loud, there is no where in my house that I can retreat to for silence. I bought this super bark stop in hopes of quieting the dog. The dog is so stupid that it barks even more when the noise starts up. So we turned the volume up so that the neighors hear it too. That's what did it. As soon as the dog started barking and the alarm sounded, the dog was brought in. That was until the neighbor broke it with a broom stick so we are buying another one. Too bad for them 
PEACE AT LAST!!!!! We have only had this for 4 days, but we are very happy. I ordered this because of RUDE neighbors who leave there 2 dogs(who bark and bark and.... they don't stop) out 24/7 is a dog run outside our bedroom window. Other neigbors have complained as well, they still won't do anything. After setting up the bark stop it didn't take long before they got the idea, they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing :) I called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs "trying to bark" I told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it, she thought that was great.( now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard) update 10/18 okay the real test came last night and again this morning.What was the test?? SIRENS!!! I just had to laugh, they couldn't bark and howl!!! All I heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them. I am so glad we bought this!!!! 
Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving! In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money. WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...? It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY! You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting. The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it. I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it! P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that "once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one 
I bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt. The offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch, where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by. Before ordering, I had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect. In my case, the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine. Unfortunately, this was not "too close for comfort" as far as the dog was concerned. Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working. Alas, it did not. Some dogs just don't hear them. In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance. My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target. If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did). By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device. Just send it to the company along with your receipt, and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange). (...) I sympathize with anyone having this problem, and wish you all the best of luck. No one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason, and the argument that "dogs bark" simply does not hold any water 
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back. The picture looks cool but it's deceiving. The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left. It couldn't keep the right time 
Glad to see they still make this clock. Yea, the parts are simple but I love the way it looks on on my wall. I even changed the dots when I moved. It used to be on a white wall, now it looks even COOLER in my new place w/ my own white dots on a GLASS wall. The one I had for 10+ years just died. I'm ordering another one. Hopefully, it'll last as long 
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want" 
I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking. I pushed the manual button and still nothing. It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute. It was a complete waste of my money 
I picked this up after reading the 50/50 reviews. One of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away. The other just wandered around and took no notice. Neither seemed scared/bothered at all. This product had zero affect on our dogs' barking. I'm going to return it 
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now 
Our dogs didn't even notice it. We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers. I was wrong - the kept on barking.. 
I have a very actiuve Border Collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything! I tried all the training methods I could find and nothing worked. I then purchased a Citronella spray gadget ($$$) which did nothing. (I think she liked the perfume.) I was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices ($$$$) but just in time my nephew lent me his Dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog. I can't recommend it enough 
Dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them. The device I received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity, some don't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them. I had a chance to try a different brand years ago and I know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison. If you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten. There you go, suicide by dog, that's a good use for it. May be it is just quality control, you might get lucky, if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won't return calls or e-mail, like i did. So you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad. Go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones. I hate being cheated. Score another point for the bad guys 
it requires effort from owners. Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior. When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from. We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much. They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands. So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here. Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either. My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean. Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.  My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention. My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself. Not sure I would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on walks..just in case. 
I have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping. It is very out of control and this device didnt help at all. I know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar. A friend has one and recommended it to me. They are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me. The dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them. 
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us. I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability. The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy. The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option. I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button. This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this. I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary. The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs. But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me 
Purchased to replace our constantly broken intercom system. Installation is a matter of pushing a button so even I was able to do it and I love the fact that I can carry the station to the washer or outside... wherever. We also bought the outdoor station and put it at the front. Now when I'm outside, I don't have to worry about not hearing the doorbell 
I have ordered this unit twice this past month, the first one did not work properly in one of the units, the signal was distorted. After returning it to the supplier, I ordered it again from another Amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all. I will now look for another brand 
The unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface. 100ft. would be pushing it 
I think this is a greater product. Unlike other intercom systems I've bought this one is wireless and the sound is clear 
I bought this for Mother's Day for my Mother and Mother in law and they both have said that they are still going strong. I was a little skeptical at first but they came though. Oh and for the other reviewer who wrote they are cheaper on Wal-mart is correct but shipping is almost $20, so this is a better deal by far! I liked this so much i am sending it to someone else 
This is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants. It would make a great gift as well 
Sent to my daughter in CA for her birthday. She loves the gardenia. The service was excellent. Thanks to Frances, Emily and My-An 
If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside. As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product 
I have a hefty tortoise-shell Manx who is constantly shedding. I saw the commercial for this product, and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals, and just had to have one. Boy, was I ever disappointed! When I try to brush my cat with it, the teeth just float on top of her hair... they don't even go down into the undercoat. Maybe it's because she's chubby, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work for her. I'm left handed, so I had to turn the blade the other way on the handle. Maybe I'm not using it right. I'm still very disappointed. The animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them 
i got this for my cat (ocicat breed). he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes. shedender worked just like the commericals. one brush and fur goes flying everywhere. it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back. as u can see in the picture the tool is small. if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool. if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead. i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price 
My three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush. She gets persistent dandruff and furballs but won't let me touch her with any other brush. I have tried about every kind of brush but she hates being groomed! So imagine my surprise when I pull this brush out of the package and she actually lays down for me to groom her after a few strokes! The only downsides to this product are: 1. the small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all the fur ends up on the floor or you are emptying it every few strokes 2. the "front" versus "back" positions - cats do not generally stay in one place, I have three and they roll and walk around while I groom them. It was a bit unconvenient to constantly switch the brush from my left to right hand to get the proper angle to de-shed my kitties. I don't know how this could be improved but it is a downside to the product. Overall it's defineitely worth the 10 bucks I spent, my Boo-boo never lets me groom her with anything else 
The way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use. I would get the Furminator instead, it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes! This technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove 
This product does what it claims. I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well. The downside of the product is the size. It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it. They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more. I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator. I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal. It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat 
I just received this product today, and I already love it. I ordered it for my cats. It works as great as they said it would 
I have a long haired Ragdoll cat. He is a constant shedder. My husband saw this and bought it for me. My cat hates being brushed so that is the challenge. But when I do it you can see the difference. I end up with a pile of fur and a much shinier cat. He doesn't seem to like it but he will escape for any brushing so I think that's just him. Having to go only one direction is a bit hard because the cat is so stubborn but I can see the difference around my house. I used to have to clean the furniture daily with a roller and now it is every few days days and no where near the amount of hair that used to get on there! I recommend this for any long haired animal! 
I bought this bookstand at the beginning of 1L after a lengthy search and lots of testing. This bookstand is metal, and it has a rubber serrated grip to hold the base of a book in a variety of positions. For me, this is a key feature b/c I use the bookstand at many different locations, and I use desks and tables of different heights. I adjust the main angle w/ the stand in the back, and furtther adjust the book's angle by wedging the spine into a rubber slot at the base. I should note two other benefits. First, for a year and a half I've put 1200 + page casebooks in this book stand and it's never bent; and I can get the spines of those casebooks to flatten out with the stabilizer arm. Huge ++. Second, I can lean into my casebooks and write in the margins. This bookstand support my upperbody weight. I don't think you'll find a plastic stand, or a wire stand, that will do that. In sum, if you're in law school, this stand will be your best friend. Your neck muscles will appreciate the investment 
After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs. Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was. This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back. Any of my school books are not stably supported. I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages. Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00). Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you. 
This book stand is an absolute necessity if you're a college student, and even if you're reading for leisure. I love having my hands free to drink a coffee or snack, or anything else I want to do. 
After recently returning to school, I was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one's neck, especially while trying to take notes at the same time. After looking at several other book stands, this seemed to be the best choice. I haven't had any trouble with my textbooks - both hardcover and softcover. Even if you're not experiencing neck pain from reading, it's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself. It also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well. I'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well 
After reading the one review on this site I ordered the bookmate and eagerly awaited it as I was using a Fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks. When it arrived I was sorely disappointed. The back support for the book measures only about 7"x7" and the depth measurement for the book is 1". Any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7"x7" is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand isn't big enough. In addition, because the depth is only 1", forget any book with say over 500 pages. At least the Fellowes stand has a back support of 12" x 9", its deficiency is its page holding arms. I can't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook, as perhaps this amazon category is targeted, could use this bookmate usefully 
I first bought one of these at Barnes Noble, or maybe through Levenger about 5 years ago, lost it traveling and spent hours and hours and hours searching the web, going to stores etc. looking for another one, but it was out of production. I bought other book stands in the interim, and looked at countless pictures of others but none came close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this little guy. Tne design is near perfect. It folds up, so you can flatten it stick it in your book. It has little feet that hold the pages of even a realy thick paper back down. It's flat surface balances on just about anything (I balance it on a pillow when I'm reading in bed). It adjusts to different angles. It's is a near perfect design. I've given this as a present and the response is always the same - "How did I ever live withouth this?" If you're a reader, DO NOT HESITATE. My motive for encouraging you? If more people buy them, they'll never go out of production and I won't have to worry about losing mine ever again. Absolutely essential for readers. 
In principle, this should be a great product. We got one and set it up in a few seconds. Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking. (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.) Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit. That one worked great...for 5 days. Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund. That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer. Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer 
We have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device. We ordered the Bark Stop Pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking. We were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we're very thankful that this device works. You have to use the high frequency for the big dogs. We would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog 
I bought the bark stop about 2 weeks ago. I had read several reviews either really good or really bad so I was quite skeptical, but my dog (jack russell terrier) would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house, so I was desperate. The most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there aren't many things that are both great and easy. When you buy treats for dog to train him, do you simply leave the treats out all the time. No. Because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to. It's the same thing with the bark stop. The first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off. I found that doors shutting hard, clanging dishes, etc all set it off. So, if the device goes off every 5 seconds, the dog isn't going to think for a second that it's going off because he's barking. He's going to assume that it's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with. So after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting, I decided that I would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage. Also, I never leave the device plugged in when I'm doing dishes slamming doors, or doing loud things. So the dog only hears the device when he barks. I realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works, but I would rather do that than have a barking dog. The way I look at it, is I wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training, so why leave it plugged in all the time. In the end, the first time I plugged in the bark stop, I let the dog bark it out. He barked for about 5 minutes (normally 10-15) and then stopped. The second time I plugged it in, he didn't bark more than twice. The bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in, so I think that now he knows when he's going to hear more than he wants to. I think that the dog has now gotten more used to it, and will try to out bark it, but for the most part, he doesn't bark much at all while it's on, if he barks at all. The one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house, usually this device won't help, which I think is a good thing. Cons: When I was testing the microphone (used for taking in the bark loudness) on the device, it didn't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low. Also, this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off, not to manage each bark, but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on, or to click it off 
The item didn't work at all. As a matter of fact. My dog didn't even flinch when I tested it right next to her head. No, she's not deaf either. We yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine. The item actually melted in the sun (it still worked though). I was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun - oh well - lesson learned. I'm not trying to sound bitter but don't waste your money on this item. I'm gonna try the shock collar next. Maybe I'll have better luck. Thanks anyways, Mik 
Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower. I also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. Not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-) Yes the timer option is very nice. This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. But what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking? So read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. Unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else. 
Very nice and handy product, I whish the light was little bit more and brighter 
I purchased this gaming/entertainment center for my son when he was only 3. He has a 13" TV/VCR and an original Nintendo system with lots of games. I thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic, easy to put together or move, and holds everything I needed it to. This item is not something an adult would want to have in his/her living area, like one of the reviews I read. I mean Step2 is a company that makes a lot of products for kids. Anyway, my son loves this product, and so does his 2 year old brother 
i bought this video center for my son for christmas as well a ps2 to store and at first i did not think that it would fit in the drawer part but it did but the ps2 games do not fit on the top left and right slots because of the length of the games however they do fit on the sides where you would put the vhs tapes and that is where my son has added his games so you would have to be a little creative with it. i had seen a review where a lady had bought this item for her son and she was very disappointed once she could not place the games in the slots and stated not to purchase. everyone out there! do not listen to that its a must have and it does help with organizing your room area! and the price at the time during the holiday season i could not resist for $71.99 plus free shipping! WOW! 
We thought this was very handy storage. It holds all our video equiptment just right 
This looks like a great organizer, but with you people that have a x-box ps2 game cube and a dvd player you can buy cd cases that music cds come in and place the ps2 xbox and game cube games in those along with the dvds. It would be a bit of money depending on how many games and dvds you have though.. 
I was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep. My eight year old son and I managed to get the unit put together, after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place. We carried it up to his room, and put the T.V. and V.C.R. into place. My excitement turned to bitter dissapointment, however, when I tried to fit my son's PS2 games into the shelves desighned to hold CD's or VCR tapes. The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model. The whole reason I ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room, so this will not work for me. I will probably try to return it, and order the newer model 
I gave this to my neighbor across the street who said he'd tried everything on his dog and had decided she was just a "barker." It worked immediately and completely. (I would only use it in ultrasonic mode because the audible mode will further annoy your neighbors.) Before I found this device I used a hose on a dog who barked under my window at various times of the night during the summer. I had to squirt the dog 3 or 4 times for a couple of nights and then the dog shut up. Dogs should sleep in the house at night. 
I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard. This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog. I could detect no effect whatsoever. Save your money, and try something else. I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking 
I used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy Australian Shepherds, one of them next door, and two more on the other side of it (so they were two doors down from me). I was skeptical, but the dog were driving us nuts. I installed a Bark Free (before the Super model was released), and the dogs quickly learned to shut up. It was remarkable. They would still bark once or twice if they got super-excited, but it stopped nearly 100% of their bored "I wish someone would let me exercise" barking. I only considered using the Ultrasonic mode. My only other word of advice is that a competitive product, the Dog Silencer Pro, is a worthless piece of garbage, and even in "Ultrasonic" mode, it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone, including humans. Avoid that one at all costs 
We bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously. I confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking, he told me if I had a problem with his dog barking to call the police, I did! He tried to have a restraining order put on us so we couldn't call the police, the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet, which he never did. So when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic. The dogs kennel is about 7ft from my garage where I hung it. The barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be. I have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also,apparently they don't like to hear it ! Too Bad, so sad! The dog gets used to it so every once in a while I unplug it for a day or so. When it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking. Plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference. It has really helped us where the neighbor wouldn't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking 
I was sleepless and willing to try anything. I mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor's back porch, where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly. Despite all my hope, I couldn't detect any change in barking with this device deployed. In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog 
I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks. I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT" 
Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product. If you decide to purchase Super Bark Free, be sure it's returnable for a full refund if it doesn't live up to its claims. And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product 
I had so many barking dogs that I was feeling like shooting them. My rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog's disruption of the neighborhood (some kind of power thing I guess). When ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill. When my last short term renter (a pastor) yelled NO! at them I became desperate. I had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs. I was looking for a new collar (cironella) I plugged in anti bark, and then up popped this Super Bark Product. I bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree. The dogs barked the entire time right at the fence, until my daughter turned it on. They ran like bats out of hell back to their house and haven't been heard since! Now I was a little sceptical at first, but I can't praise this product enough. You can not get anything else that will do this for you. You can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win. If you move, you might end up with more barking. Look. It's worth the money, believe me!!!! 
I turned the device onto human sound because on sub-sonic, I didn't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning. The device itself on human sound was triggered by many things, air condtioner, mower, air plane, thunder, etc. which was not good in that I doubt it would serve as an effective training device. The dogs seemed to trigger it at random times. We have large lots here in this area of NJ and I placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem. HOWEVER, my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole I placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs' outside times. She advised me that her book clubs (inside) and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly. The capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation. I would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone 
We have four dogs, and they're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking. One of our neighbors "strongly suggested" this product as a possible remedy. I did some investigation before purchasing, including talking to the manufacturer. Their sense was that it works for about 50% of dogs, which is in line with what I saw in other on-line reviews at the time (this was about a year and a half ago). Anyway, because they had a good return policy I went ahead and made the purchase, and it worked wonderfully. The barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it, and in fact we wished we had bought more (we have a very big yard). That led to our downfall: we were moving it around frequently, and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch. Oops. Needless to say, it didn't work after that. But, remarkably, the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months. Now the grass is green, the buds are blooming, and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive, so it's time to replace the unit. This time I'm buying two, and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer. 
This unit works great.. for a couple of months. I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog 
I was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product. Our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie,(the barker) and our collie, (the follow-up barker) before investing in yet another "bark deterrant". We have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound,while also using the reinforcing "Quiet". After observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days, we are ready to purchase. I am sure that it probably won't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days' or in households that are very active, but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that "wound up" frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason. Considering the $50 cost in comparison to some products in the $100 range which quit and had to be re-purchased immediately to not break training continuity - check with a trainer, boarder or groomer and test it out first. We are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house 
I have done a lot of dog training but I have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new. I have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do. Once they got the idea, they really enjoyed it. I am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled. This product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible. The teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog's natural instinct. I would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual 
THIS IS THE GREATEST! I had been pricing kits at about $1500 and more. This was the answer to my dreams. It is good quality, simple and is all you need for your dog to learn and have a great time 
Your Product's Name that really describes what the product really does! It is amazing that the Hair magnet really is easy to use and more amazing is the manner in which it preformes gathering pet hair 
This is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go. It's not a quick removal tool (think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming), but for things like wool dhurrie rugs, it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things. It really does pull up tons of fur, even from deep in a rug 
As a military spouse, we move, and have different types of floors that need cleaning. I have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home, and also in our previous home abroad. The Vaccum side does not work well at all, but I prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how I mop. In comparison to sponge and rag mops, this leaves the floor pretty dry, and the suction is great. As long as you empty the tank and keep it clean, and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank, it works wonderfully. It's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers, that generally just push dirt around. I believe it's worth the $$. I've had mine for two years now 
I looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one. I chose the Flip-It for the price which was much lower and for the size. This unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around. I felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out. I have wood floors in the kitchen, nook, and foyer and I can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over. It's not any faster than mopping but it's much easier. My floors really clean and who wouldn't love that 
Product arrived on day promised. The cleaner was ordered by my mother, who is no longer physically able to keep her bare floors as clean as desired by other methods. She tells me that she is very satisfied with the product. It cleans the floor to her high standards with a minimum of time and labor. 
I have really loved this set. It looks great, cleans easily, and I love cooking with it. You really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking, but once I got used to that I haven't had any problems 
After 40 years of marriage, I have finally found cookware that lives up to its description. I enjoy cooking with these pots. They cook evenly and are a breeze to clean. The handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling them.I even like the glass lids that allow me to see what's happening without lifting the lid. I just recommended them to my daughter-in-law 
I bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price. Wrong... This pots get scratches from anything that goes near them. After a few months of gentle use, they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful. Also, the handles get really hot. 
I purchased this cookware based on very favorable reviews and I'm happy to say that these pots and pans are great! Both my husband and I enjoy cooking and he's as happy with this cookware as I am. He keeps telling me what a great buy I made! I really like being able to cook at lower temps and I love the glass lids. Anyone looking for excellent cookware at a reasonable price should buy this product 
Bought this item for my daughter and she loves it. Threw away her old stuff because of this. Says in makes cooking enjoyable 
I was very impressed with this cookware. I was a little skecptical about the handles being stainless steel, because I thought they would be too hot to the touch while cooking. However, I have had no problems picking up the pots or pans by the handle while they are still hot. This is an exceptional buy for the money. 
Just got these about 3 weeks ago. They cook very well and I really like the see though lids. The only thing I consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the "rivet" that was used to secure the handle to the pan. Kind of a pain to keep that area clean. Overall very satisfied with the pans 
Wonderful set... also got the 12QT stockpot with this free... so very slickdeal :) Great nonstick coating, but you really must hand wash... but that is ok!! 
Good combination. I keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have, no worry about changing batteries 
Accessory for the LED version of Zelco's excellent "itty bitty booklight". Assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days. 
This will be the third Thumper I've bought. Lost the first one on a trip, second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift. It's simple to use, loud enough to wake you and doesn't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes. The thumper pad is big enough to hit when you're groggy! More products should be as easy to live with as this one! 
Having problems hanging your family photos? This is the perfect product and inexpensive. Sooooooo easy... 
These are great. I hung a heavy picture using one of these hooks and it is still hanging. It was very easy to use 
They really do work as advertised. They go right into drywall (be careful not to hit a stud however!) with no muss and no fuss. I haven't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds, but for basic home picture hanging, etc. they really do work as advertised 
Works as advertised. Can not be used if wall stud is directly behind use point. At roughly $1 per hook, a hammer and nail makes more sense 
These Hercules Hooks are absolutely incredible. I wish I had them before my husband put many, many holes in our walls with anchors and screws. If I want to relocate anything, he tries to patch up the hole, but it always shows. These hooks make only a pin sized hole! I hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it. It is still there. Incredible product and well worth the price 
This is a excellent product.. as described very easy to incert and position... haven't checked the weight capability.. not disappointed 
These hooks are incredible!! I have used them throughout my home to hang heavy art work and mirrors, and the best part is that I can do it myself without waiting for my husband to get out his drill, hammer, leveler, etc. I love them so much we have given them as house warming gifts, and everyone that has received them from us has been as amazed as we are by how effective and easy they are to use! If you want a secure and quick way to hang anything on your walls without making a huge hole use these hooks! 
I am very pleased with this fryer. It heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods. Unlike most consumer grade fryers, this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries. Other fryers 'choke,' lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together. Not with this baby. I used a coupon, got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister. This was a great deal 
Bought ours two years ago after considerable research. Busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout. Not one problem yet. Best one on the market as far as I am concerned. 
this is a well thought out product for consumer use. easy to clean, easy to use. tried others and was very disappointed but i'm extremely pleased with this one. some advice stay away from the euro-pro 
I purchased this deep fryer after doing considerable research on-line. I wanted one with a good capacity and that would be reliable. It has surpassed my expectations. We have been using it for over a month. The initial use was to fry chicken tenders for a large party. 15 lbs. of chicken tenders were fried in no time with very little oil useage. Since that time we have fried okra, french fries, tater tots, onion petals, cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream. All have turned out very well. It holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil. This heats up in about 10 minutes. There is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature. Once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature. This produces crisp foods with no oily taste and very little oil useage. It has a breakaway magnetic cord to keep it from accidently being pulled off of the counter. It cleans up as easily as can be expected. I just put the basket and the oil resevoir in the dishwasher. The food can be lowered into the oil with the lid in place. This keeps oil spatters to a bare minimum. I have been very happy with my purchase. So have the hoards of teenagers that gather at my house. There has even been one instance when THEY brought the food and did their own frying. Although frying is not the most healthy way to prepare food at least with this deep fryer it is easy, quick, tasty, nearly mess-free and about as grease free as possible. While this one costs a bit more than others on the market I certainly feel as though I am getting my money's worth 
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge. After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon. In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. I must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful). Only complaint would be that the capacity is a little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time). But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue. It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect. I figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake. Although I've only fried a couple of batches, I am beyond pleased - but I'll let you know if I have any problems... Great item so far though.  
Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after. Very pleased overall. 
i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy. 
I purchased this for my wife. A hundred bucks for a knife insane! Until you use it. I think this is worth the money. My wife says is the best thing since sliced bread. And... you can slice bread with it. Seriously, great knife. It will last a long time. Don't keep buy cheapo knives year after year. Just get one of these. Very sharp edge, nice weight, and comfortable. 
After working with a combination of German knives for more than ten years, I decided to buy a Global knife and give it a shot. It feels great in my hand and is easy to handle and work with. The blade is incredibly sharp and has held its edge very well. All in all, I liked this knife so much that I decided I wanted more of them and bought the 6-piece set. I can't give it a much better endorsement than that 
I bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable. As a vegetarian, I use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless. Money very well spent as I know it'll last a lifetime 
I originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant I work at had one. I picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind. A couple weeks later I bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener. I have no idea what that other guy must be doing to his knife but my blade sharpens very easily and stays sharp for months as long as you don't abuse it. By far my favorite knife that I have used. One warning though: if you are going to do a large amount of chopping (like say you're a prep cook or you make Thanksgiving-like dinners twice a month) then the angled shape of the back of the blade may rub the side of your knife-hand index finger the wrong way. I cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday and have only been irritated by the shape a few times under heavy chopping regimes but it is something to consider. Overall I couldn't love this knife more. It's the most important kitchen tool I have ever owned 
I've been a German knife snob for years. But this 8-inch chef's knife by Japan's Global is the finest blade I've ever owned. Period. Maybe it's not as easy to sharpen as a Wustof or a Henckel, but then again, it holds its edge ten times longer. I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel. Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again 
I baught my 8" global chef's knife about 5 years ago. It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market. The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts. My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands. I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip. My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether. Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand. I highly recommend globals, but I might suggest the 8 1/4" heavyweight model, which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the Bolster. For more info on knife handling and care you might check out the CIA's book titled "The Professional Chef's Knife Kit". And one last comment. Although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe, please, PLEASE, don't put your knives in the dishwasher. 
I desperately needed a new knife because my old Chicago Cutlery wooden handle knife became a gross and nasty E. coli distributing piece of junk. which was very sad because I loved that knife! I had it for 20+ years. I ended up buying this knife because I really liked the look of the handle. It looked like it would grip well. and it does. To me it seemed a bit expensive, but the Stainless Chicago Cutlery knives handles were very smooth so there were few choices for me. The most important point is what ever brand you choose, go with non-wooden handles. don't make the mistake that I made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives. Bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick 
We have Sabatier and Wusthof sets but this is the first knife that every one of the family goes for first. Perfect balance, easy to sharpen, cuts meat, juliennes perfectly; even slices tomatoes. Pair this with the Global paring knife and really that's all you need. (Although my wife now wants her own for Christmas - clearly she's an incurable romantic) 
The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries. Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed. Then the LEDs started flickering. The next day, it was dead. To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head. But something on the little circuit board must have blown. The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book. I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least. Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better. I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions. I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out. This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money. They are a nice idea, but have no durability. If they were cheaper, it might not be such a big deal, but for their price I would like to see them be far more durable 
Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective 
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use. It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times. I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled 
I have looked over this product (it is a birthday present for someone else, so I haven't actually used it) and find that it meets all my expectatons for size, light weight, design 
Very well made reading light. Nice carrying case. Decent battery consumption. Fits most of the books really well. Happy reading 
I have tried a number of different battery-powered booklights and they all go through batteries in about 5 minutes. This light can be purchased with an AC adapter, eliminating the need to constantly replace batteries. It is bright enough to clearly illuminate the pages of your book, stays where it's clipped and reasonably adjustable. I love it 
The light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night. It would have been better with three for four LEDs 
I love this light! I spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book w/o disturbing my husband. It's also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs (like most other reading lights). Couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance 
I bought this breadmaker because I wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf. It makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and I recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro. Nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen! I have not bought a loaf of bread since I've owned this fine bread making machine 
I've been using my Zojirushi for over two years now and make at least a couple loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread a week along with fancier breads using the dough function. I love the fact that there are two paddles to knead the bread, this works so much better than my machine of 10 years ago with just one paddle which often left gobs of unkneaded incredients. I also really like the horizontal full loaf pan. You can make normal sandwich loaves with this design. The one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting, rising and baking times individually. Sometimes I want the dough to rise longer than the preset times but there's no way of overriding it. Oh well, guess nothing is perfect. I highly recommend this product 
I have had 4 different bread machines, all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style. I didn't mind the bread they turned out, but I didn't like the loaf shape. My prayers have been answered! I can't quit making bread now! The loaves come out perfect, and if they don't I have come to relize that with bread it is typically the COOK's error, not the machine's. You need to really read the directions, which I find most people don't. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine, you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it. I've made all kinds of sweet, sourdough, french, italian, herb and cheese, fruit, and beer breads in the machine.....you name it, and they all come out just fine. If not, I tweak the recipe, I don't blame the machine. All in all, an excellent product. This is my favorite bread machine so far. The only down side is the sourdough setting. Don't be fooled... the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar. For true sourdough, you have to wait the 7-10 days. But if you can't wait.... Oh, and the "big viewing window". Unless someone installs a light inside the machine, you can't really see what's going on anyway. After my first 50 loaves I will let you know how it's holding up 
I own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year. I bake 1-2 per week. The machine makes excellent bread dough. I haven't bought a loaf of bread since I bought this machine. When I want a more crusty bread, make pizza, or make a foccacia I use the dough cycle with amazing results. Highly reccomend this product. P.S. It takes a little practice, if you never used a bread machine before. Read instuctions carefully measure ingredients. If your bread is slopsided watch for drafts. Most of my breads come out looking picture perfect the taste you can't compare it with store bought bread. Plus, no preservatives or additives of any kind 
I bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and I use it every day. The white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time. I've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs. I tried one wheat bread loaf ... it was very tasty, but not quite the consistency that I like ... so I need to play around with that one alittle bit. I've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before ... but now that my kids are grown up, I now have some time to work in the kitchen. I highly recommend this machine 
Within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect. This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning. The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond). I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman. At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one. Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect. I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate: 1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much. 2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense. 3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs. 4) The programmability options are very limited: - You can't control the knockdown time between risings. - You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings. - You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle. - When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones. - And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a "safety feature" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion. For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations. At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology. All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination. A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution. I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution 
We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients. We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work. Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate 
I had several bread machines before my Zojirushi, and they baked ok but with my Zojirushi is just amazing, I bake the most delicious and gorgeous breads, cakes and jams. Throw away all your bread machines and get the BEST.get one Zojirushi. Also try other products from Zojirushi, I have the rice machine and the eletric skillet and the are great 
There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get 
i have been using six second abs for a month. i can see my stomach getting flatter. so i wouldnt believe the commericals that say it took them a week to get a six pack but if you want a flatter stomach then this will help overtime 
Contrary to the opinion expressed in the previous review I found the resistance levels more than adequate. It might be that it was being used incorrectly by using the back and arms rather than pulling from the abs. I developed very good ab definition after around 2 months working out at 120 crunches on my back 3 times/week. Only problem was the machine broke when it wasn't even on the highest setting - but I intend buying another 
It's a great concept although resistance is almost useless. I'm in my mid-thirties and, although reasonably fit, have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them. Here was a solution which claimed to get around this. When I first got the unit, I gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable. I opened the front, replaced the yellow bands with the "heavy duty" orange ones and tried again - again, almost nothing. At 6 seconds a rep, 10 minutes gets you 100 reps. Don't know about you but although I could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense, I would certainly know about it the next day. I tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing. This makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they "feel the burn" very hard to believe. With that said, this isn't necessarily the fault of "As Seen on TV" that they sell this product - what's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although I can't imagine who. They did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10% restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a non-refundable shipping cost, it hardly makes it worth the effort. Am going to find another use for it - perhaps a coat hanger? Positive voters must be getting kick-backs from somewhere. Perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it. Don't believe me - buy one and find out for yourself. 
I have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for $20 (not on sale either - regular price). Same siz 
We use these more than any other dishware items in our pantry. They go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven. Plus, they are indestructable, whether dropped, banged in the dishwasher, or otherwise abused. They are pretty small however; U can fit a can of corn or heat up a chicken breast or two in the microwave, but not much more fits into it. We have 8 for a family of 4, and we could use a couple more if we had the space. So buy extras 
The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect. They are HORRIBLE! Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card. When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money. Bad, Bad Servic 
I only bought 2 and now wish I'd purchased 8. They are heavy and appear very durable. The lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal, actually much better than expected. Wait for them to reappear on the Friday sale and save a couple of bucks. I assure you you won't be disappointed 
It is the perfect size for a bowl to eat out of, it has a lid so it is good for leftovers or taking to work, and having a handle is great. There are no worries about taking a hot dish out of the microwave: you just grab the handle and eat. Probably, ideal for teens or college kids. Also, they also hold up well. We have a couple that are about 10 years old, and recently bought some more on Amazon 
I love the grab-its! They are wonderful. I was so disappointed when the outlet store I used to buy them from told me that they no longer make these. So, I am thrilled that I was still able to find these online and with the lids!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH! 
i've got one of these floating around my house (without the lid) with the other "common" (shared) dishes.. and i have to say, everyone loves this one. i think it's great b/c of the handle, more than anything else. college students like handles on their dishes 
I bought this to use for "brown bagging" but have used it for so much more. THis little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks, all without having to change the contents to a "dressier" dish. French White is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money 
I love these dishes, I bought these because I need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white, they mix with the set beautifully! I like the feel of the classic Wedgewood bone china so I'm glad they priced this set so I can afford to use them for everyday dishes. The packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes, but surprising everything made to me in one piece, so I'm very happy with my purchase 
I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware. Best set I have every owned or used. Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots pans. The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top. I paid $24.99 for this when I bought a few other pieces. Got free shipping $25.00 off the order 
It works great and I like being able to use metal spoons. It apears to be of great quality 
Very pleased with the quality of this pan, good weight and cooks food evenly, clean up is easy too. Good product 
LOVED this pan; I got several others too. Price was much below average 
I am so over nonstick--even Calphalons. I have been gradually replacing all my nonstick with uncoated cookware. This Saucepan really rocks. I use it all the time. I don't have to worry about scratching it, and I really haven't had much trouble with clean up. 
I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since. I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review). The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles. The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again. Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot. Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes. 
I like the size and shape of this saucepan. It is big enough for something like spaghetti sauce or even mashed potatoes, but not so big is overwhelms smaller jobs. Cleans up nice and the lid is good 
Really have enjoyed using this Saucepan. Cooks evenly, does not stick, cleans up good. Thinking of purchasing more of this product 
The money tree arrived today on time. It was a gift to me :) I opened the box and couldn't believe how perfect this tree was. I'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon. Especially for the holidays. The roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree. Thanks 
I have ten dogs and eleven cats plus I volunteer at a local rescue group, and I always keep a couple of bottles in my medicine chest. Two of my dogs use it all the time: a golden retriever with allergies and a cocker spaniel with chronic ear infections due to severe neglect in his previous life. Zymox with hydrocortisone has an enzyme that promotes natural healing plus the hydrocortisone takes the itch away so they don't scratch themselves raw thus prolonging/enlarging the infection. I also use it on the ocassional yeast or bacterial infection (you don't even have to guess what kind because it works for both), twice a day for a couple of weeks takes care of it without having to pay a vet's examination fee 
My dog had ear problems for years and finally came across this product. Cleared it up in one week, with only a couple of applications. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with chronic ear problems 
My chihuahua has had chronic ear problems since he was a little puppy. I'm not a fan of the antibiotic ointments that vets prescribe because they contain medication he doesn't need for his yeast problems. I've tried all sorts of natural ear cleansers to no avail. I found this product highly recommended by an online vet site so I thought I'd give it a shot. Within 2 days his ears looked perfect...no scratching or shaking either. It's been 3 weeks since I last put in the drops and I haven't had to worry about them since. I honestly can't believe how well this solution works. I'm so happy my little guy isn't feeling miserable with his ears anymore. : 
used vet's RX to treat my dog's ear and it didnt seem to work. After reading reviews I decided to try this . After only 1 week I noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better. would recommend to others 
My golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old. Over the years we have tried allergy shots, dietary changes, and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune. We tried Zymox and it is absolutely fantastic. Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment. The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear. This stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges, I'm happy to keep it on hand 
My beagles have chronic ear infections and I was spending hundreds of dollars per year to keep them in check - doctor visits in order to get the prescribed (and expensive) mal-otic. Zymox Otic has solved the problem, keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when I started it. Be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection. 
irecently purchased a bottle of zymox with hydrocortisone for my lab who has had several really bad ear infections i was spending a fortune at the vets office.i searched the web until i read about this product.i decided to give it a try.im sooooo glad i did.this works !her ears are clear ,she is happy again.i will keep buying this product.thank you zymox 
This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there. Zymox takes about a week to work, with one or two treatments a day. It has had the same effect for my sister's dog who had had recurrent ear infections. I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success 
My 10 yr old Cocker Spaniel has had cronic ear infections for 4 yrs. She has developed a resistance towards most antibiotics and steroids and all antibiotics make her stomach sour. Some antibiotics even make her ears worse! Nothing works completely, but Zymox seems to give her a reasonable comfort zone. Without Zymox, expensive total ear canal ablation surgery would be her only option. After expensive TPLO surgery and 4 years of ear infections, my finances have been exhausted. Zymox has given me better results than the vet, saves $150 a month vs the vet, and is well worth the daily ear cleaning and drops 
I read about Zymox on a vet's website regarding chronic ear infections. My black Lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when I found her. The usual story of rounds of antibiotics, including expensive Baytril, without resolution of her problem. It's been almost a month now and her ears are improving. I find that I cannot skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs, but if done daily she has little goo. I plan on continuing every day and I hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns. Zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics 
This is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver. I am purchasing another one because it's working so well. I am a professional dog trainer, and all I can say is that the product is great, but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed. As a professional dog trainer, I still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers. Our toy poodle was essentially house-trained when I was home, but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out, she ended up peeing in front of the door, because nobody was letting her out. So, I got the Lentek Door Chime, and taught my dog to use it, and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear. We also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in. Everybody is happy. Now I'm getting another pad for upstairs, because we still have oblivious teens and hubby.... So, great product, but be sure that you have *both* parts of the product, and give a good trainer a call to help you get started. 
I was really hopeful about this product working. I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8. I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button. They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it 
It takes a little patience to get the dog to use it, at first she thought is was a treat machine, but eventually she realized it meant go outside. Works very well. 
This is very misleading. this item is only half of the package. after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work. very disappointed in amazon for allowing this 
Easy to use. Our dog learned how to use it reliably in a couple of days. No directions came with it, we called our trainer and asked how to do it. 
I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well 
I hung 2 big jingle bells on a sturdy ribbon by the door it accomplishes the same thing with no batteries to worry about! Consistantly ring the bell before opening the door and he'll learn in 2 or 3 days 
We love our pet chime. It took a little time to train our dog on it but now it's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out. It's also a great conversation piece when company is over. We've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and haven't had any problems. We're getting an extra paw 
In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw two additional paws. I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks. In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek. They're great, IF THEY WORK 
It's hard to find anything wrong with such a damn good juicer that I only paid $25 for. What can beat that? Money very well spent. It does spray a little depending on what you're putting in, but again what juicer doesn't? I can live with this for $25! Wear an apron duh. It does say in the manual that it doesn't do wheatgrass, I missed that bit, but no biggie! I can cope for only $25.. Carrots, beets, celery, cabbage, ginger, cucumber, peppers, apples, pears etc, all hard veg and fruit are just perfect, it does these really well. I adore Oranges done in this juicer, with all the pith on they come out so creamy! Not acidic like regular OJ. I'm still hooked, got my juicer a few weeks back and I'm still using it daily. it's awesome 
I'd been looking for a good juicer for a number of months, but had shied away because they're expensive. I saw this deal, read and analyzed the reviews, and rolled the dice. It arrived yesterday, and after easily disassembling it to wash the parts and get to know it initially, I ran a half dozen carrots through it. OMG!! Fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen! Clean-up was easy (well, I was an old pro by now) and quick--under five minutes. To address some of the negatives you may read, first, size: of course it's big. They're all big and bulky. It's their nature. Second, residue: my carrot pulp was DRY. I suppose if I'd put it on the floor and stood on it I might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it. Third, it's factory reconditioned: for me, that's a plus. Consider this: the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line, each one eye-balled and polished by QC before bagging and boxing, assuming that they are all good to go. But, a factory re-con is gone over from top to bottem, inside and out before it's released. No assumptions--the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again, so you know they'll make sure they don't. And if it'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem, I can certainly live with that considering the discount I'm getting. I'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away, but Waring is an old and trusted brand, and the juicer is not cheaply made. I'll be back in a year (hopefully not sooner) to give some time perspective to this review. As soon as I finish writing this, I'm ordering two more as Christmas gifts. 
Though I have not tried the juicer yet, but i could not pass off the price 
I am very happy with it: inexpensive, easy to clean and nice-looking. Highly recommend 
I've wanted a juicer for a long time, but could never really justify the expense, knowing that I'd very likely quickly tire of the maintenance involved. When I saw this juicer for under $25, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed with the unit's solid construction. You can see right away that this isn't a plastic piece of junk that's going to break righ away. With the unit's first use, I juiced: cabbage, kale, spinach, carrots, onions and peppers. The unit - while not as powerful as more expensive models, I'm sure - juiced up everything with no hesitation. I would describe the pulp to be damp, but not what I'd call really wet. I dreaded the juicer clean-up process that I'd heard so much about. Disassembly of the unit is a breeze. There are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of thirty-seconds. No problem. If there's one thing I could change, it would be a better designed pulp-catcher that would allow a bag to be used. This is only a minor gripe and has in no way made me regret the purchase. If you are a casual juicer, looking to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money, this would be a perfect choice. I'm still amazed that I got this for under $25 and I'd recommend it without hesitation 
I'm absolutely thilled with this Waring! It's definitely changed my opinion of juicers. I purchased the reconditioned model. It arrived factory (re?)-packaged and looked brand new. Not a single mark on it, not even a fingerprint! It's far easier to clean, obviously by superior design: the parts clean up like new in the dishwasher. The components fit perfectly, despite probably a couple hundred uses. It's exponentially faster, and the remainders are noticeably dryer. (As another reviewer mentioned, this refuse obviously indicates a very efficient juicer!) Looks, sounds and functions like a very upscale appliance. No spraying, no movement, no juicer "drama"! :-) Absolutely the best one I've owned and after lots of uses, it's still going as strong as it did when it arrived. 
I received my Reconditioned Waring Juice Extractor today. So far, so good. I've wanted to have a juicer for a long time, but was discouraged becasue of the prices. This unit sells refubed for $25-$30 here on ebay. For that price, I had to order. Assembly takes about 30 seconds. I sliced up an apple and tossed in some celery and a pear. The motor sounds very powerful and went through everything I tossed in there quite quickly. Wow. Very good. I can see this is going to cost a lot in fresh fruits and veggies. Now, I wouldn't say mine is completely splash free, but only a few tiny drops at most escaped. The fiber/pulp that was left behind was moist, but not dripping wet. I'd give it an 87% for extraction. Clean up was easy. There are basically 6 parts to this thing. The metal cup, the spinning bit, the catching part, the lid, the plundger, and the motor/main unit. They all come apart for easy cleaning. The spinning bit's screen gets gunk clogging the holes, but that cleans easily with a sponge and the included brush. The catch, pludger, and lid are plastic and can go in the upper part of the dish washer. Or you can do it by hand in about a minute. Great deal thus far 
This juicer is fantastic. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was and was actually rather apprehensive when it arrived. I plugged it in and juiced half of my fridge. It was so good that I just juiced the other half. 
As this is a consumable food product, I'd like to know what each color is made of. ??????????? 
This food coloring was the best I have ever used. It is very concentrated. I obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time. I did not notice a flavor at all so I look forward to trying the black. The bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish 
I bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing. The Ateco food coloring gave nice bright, vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well. I was totally satisfied with the purchase 
These are easy to use, they do not make a mess, and offer vibrant colors. They do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can. I would highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate 
I purchased 2 of these cages and my first comment is that the picture of the cage is just what you are getting. It is hard to find a large cage for parakeets with the correct bar spacing so no one slips out. This cage was the answer for all of our needs. Not only is the bar spacing great for our paratkeets but there is lots of room. The stand that the cage sits on is very sturdy and does not wobble like a lot of cages that come with seperate stands. Assembly is also easy. The only time I had to pull out a tool was to put the stand together and that was very easy to do. If you are using this cage for parakeets you should use twisty ties to secure the doors even more. Parakeets love to lift the doors up and down and it is a matter of time before they realize they can also get out. The cage is also very nice for our parakeets because it has different levels that the birds love to explore. Great cag 
Junk, junk, junk.  Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service. Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever. This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website. We purchased Cuisinart, works great 
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor. It is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance. It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time. The egg beater attachment is excellent also. I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all 
The best Salsa, The best Pesto, and Salad dressings made with this food processor we all should have one 
This is a terrific machine. Amazon's price beat everyone, especially with their 20% promotional discount, no sales tax and no shipping charges. The oversized feed tube makes pre-processor preparation much simpler as I don't have to try to "fit" my ingredients into a narrow tube. Clean-up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully-sealed motor/base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses/messes. It's quiet and efficient. I only wish that there were more outlets (hear me Amazon?) that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level. Overall, I am highly satisfied and happy I spent a little more and got the best 
This is our first food processor. Did a lot of looking before making this purchase. It's easy to use and clean. Made Salsa with our garden fresh tomatoes the day it arrived. Makes slicing a breeze. Great price from Amazon! No complaints of any kind 
This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl, juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed. 
This is the best kitchen appliance we own. My wife has saved more time with this appliance. Very strong motor, nice look. Our garden is all choppped up 
very happy with the proformance of the processor.made the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done great.the pizza still needs to be worked on lol.all-in-all,fantastic product 
I loved this item until it became fused to the base. I called CS and they sent me a prepaid UPS label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a $50 off coupon to keep using Kitchenaid. Very impressive 
Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday. Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun. My father tried to contact them and nobody responded. I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund. I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist 
Hey guys get these flowers and score some points.........!!! they looked good and smelled great. my wife was impressed .....oh by the way send them to her work...... 
When the person got the flowers she really liked them. She talked and talked about them. She also was suprised in a good way how long the flowers lasted (roses). I ordered flowers from them for Mother's Day because of my experince. Great job 
Showed up on time, with a cold pack, wraped in a box and a phone number to contact and the person who inspected it. Very nicely done 
Showed up on time, with a cold pack, wraped in a box and a phone number to contact and the person who inspected it. Very nicely done 
I surprised a friend with these flowers. They arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo. Even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses. To bad that they are not shipping in Romania. Update: After 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice. I am so glad that I could make someone happy with these very nice roses 
my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box. the roses were dead and black. she thought i was mad at her. do not buy. i repeat... do not buy 
I am very disappointed. These flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store. I ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked. I buy roses alot, and I know what a fair cost is for good quality. If you're paying less than $30, beware 
I checked the ProFlowers site and it said I still had 3 days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before Christmas. It's now the day after Christmas and they still haven't gotten them 
The flowers not only arrived in good time, they were also so lovely. My friend, who loves roses, was very impressed. Definitely a great purchase 
I was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my Itty Bitty Book Light.....and at such a reasonable price. Fast shipping too 
I bought this device one week ago and I like it a lot. It counts steps pretty accurately, I measured it three time and I got the following results: 401/400, 101/100 and 897/900. The first number is what it showed, the second what I walked. Basically accuracy at 1% or better, which is exceptional for this price. I use the least sensitive setting. The backlight is very nice and by tilting the device a bit more one can see the display clearly at night. The clamshell design is also nice and practical, avoiding pressing buttons accidentaly (and resetting for example a day's steps). Now, do not buy this device for the FM radio. The reception is pretty poor and the quality of sound when you get a signal is what you would expect from a device costing as much as this. Plus I guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function. I do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism, but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more. In conclusion, this device has a good price for what it gives, although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy, but definately do not seem as sturdy. Personally I like this device a lot and I highly recommend it (pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries) 
I bought one of these for my girlfriend... THEN read the reviews! In my opinion it appears to work fairly well. The sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. To the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. As I said, in terms of accuracy, I think it's pretty good. The radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. The sound is "tinny"; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! Though overall, when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. If you already have a Walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet 
Excellent pedometer for the money. Worthwhile investment. I only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity, and now it works great. Radio works great also.. Definately reccommend 
This pedometer is great. It's very small and very light. I forget it's even there. It keeps me motivated to walk more and the radio is wonderful for walks around the neighborhood. I have dropped it a couple of times, but it has not damaged the Pedometer at all. It's a great product and I definitely recommend it 
I was amazed at how much I am enjoying my Flavia Fusion. I saw it at a boat show and tried some. My husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I really love it. I love the decaf house blend. It is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf. Decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it. The Flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee. I also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well. I like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks. It surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research BEFORE buying it. It is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee. The Flavia is a luxury item, not for a poor working stiff. Anyway, the Flavia is fast and simple and convenient. In fact, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now. Enjoy it 
I absolutely love this machine! The selection of coffees and teas is wonderful. I am a tea drinker, primarily Engish Breakfast and Chai latte, and I am quite picky about the quality. With some of the pod brewers I have tried, the tea has been quite weak. However with the Flavia, the Engish Breakfast tea is very good. The Chai is excellent as well. The Chai latte is very smooth and doesn't have the peppery taste that some can have. Pros: 1. Great tasting coffees and teas 2. Great selection 3. Virtually no clean up 4. You can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea doesn't taste like coffee (very important) Cons: 1. You better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen. This will only happen once, trust me, because you will not want this to happen again. 2. You can only purchase coffees and teas through their website. Hopefully as this machine becomes more popular there will be more options for purchasing 
What a quick easy way to make a great cup of coffee. I like to mix the packs up and make my own brew. I have freinds that love the machine and went and bought them one. This is the best coffee machine we have ever owned.What I like is I can mix the diffrent packs and make my own brew that you cant get in a coffee shop or at the store. HINT. get the Vanilla Syrup pack and add it in the mix 
We have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee. At long last, it has arrived in the form of the Flavia Fusion! This is the easiest, quickest, most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make. The unit does have a large footprint, but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger. Set up is simple - remove from box, insert the filter, fill it with water and plug it in. Thats it. Once you "prime" the system (pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch)you're ready to go. Insert the beverage packet, adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel, push the button and voila! Since the water is preheated you get a hot, delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds. If you get the "medley" pack (value $29.99)you also get a free travel mug. Contrary so what some reviewers have said, it DOES fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray. The medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you don't like it. The "creamy topping" is a must have for any special "indulgence" drinks you want, a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like Starbucks, which it does. This is a fantastic time saver in the morning, and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person. As for clean up, there are two words.."what cleanup?". You take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage, simple as that. No more filters to buy, no more pots to descale, no more throwing out half of the pot that you didn't drink. Just amazing. 
This machine is wonderful! I first tried Flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the Mercedes dealership. Best coffee I'd had in a long time. It's so nice to walk into the kitchen, insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot......whatever I feel like! This machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets, whether they are teas, coffee or chocolate. I would recommend this to anyone 
I love this machine. Each package is its own brewing system. That means that there is nothing to clean, nothing to clog, and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other. I love strong coffee and I found even the House Brand to be full flavored. Most surprising is how good the teas taste. You actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea. The herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor. The only disappointment was the hot chocolate: It was basically just as good as Swiss Miss. The frothing packages do work, but I get just as good if not better from skim milk and a $2 gizmo from IKEA. They are nice to keep on hand. The Milky Way froth does give a nice caramel flavor. The big down side is you can only get refills from Flavia. They have recently started giving free shipping on orders over $100, so stock up and get the free shipping. My big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir: I have accidentially run out of water more than once. The machine does 'spit' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup 
This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee. That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives 
Granted, it is a bit noisy at first (more like a shocking sound, not so much noisy), but you get used to it. The mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill, especially if you've never used any of the larger office machines. This was a complete first for me. I mixed a few, watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes, but I got the hang of it and love it. I commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at $2 to $3 a cup, so there's a huge savings in this product. And the tea is the best I've ever had. They actually add juice concentrates in the pack (some selections), so the tea is very flavorable. The machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter, but I think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home. It will always stick out at first. I bought black and it looks great. There really isn't any cleanup at all. Other machines I looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons. This really is so simple. Finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter. Because the packs are bigger than most pods, it is a challenge. I ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry. The round display rack that Flavia offers looks pretty neat. I will definately buy that. Over all, it's a perfect product in my opinion 
only problem i have with it... is that the plug doesn't go all the way into the power supply.. which seems a little bit unsafe but works grea 
It was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than don't fit (although the bottom feet, which you do have to assemble, had to be forced in order to fit). It's also quite attractive. I should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures, because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is. It's nice to see real wood, but I am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff Ikea sells is more environmentally friendly. Finally, you can't beat the price. 
This is functional, yet very nice to look at and is extremely easy to put together. It holds alot of DVD's or CD's and looks nice with any deco 
This is my third mission collection item, and it lives up to the other two. You can't go wrong with this collection. I use it for picture frames on a small wall that seemed too empty. It took nothing to assemble and is great looking! Highly recommended 
We have one, like a couple other reviewers here, in the dark color; we've had it for probably a couple of years. We love it! With our ever-expanding DVD collection, we went back to Target to get another one, and now all they have is natural. Can't seem to find the dark wood one anywhere online either. Can anyone help?! PS - I checked ebay too, with no luck. I'm guessing nobody's selling theirs because they love it so much 
I have one in a dark color. I can't find anymore anywhere. Anyone know if they stopped making the other color 
I think this item is a great buy. Well designed and very functional although I use it for my DVD's instead of CD's. However, my DVD collection has extended beyond the capacity for one tower so I'm seeking to buy another but I wanted another dark walnut tower since the rest of my book shelves and my DVD tower I've gotten from Amazon are also in this color. Is there any way of finding this item in dark walnut 
The Hoover F5914-900 is my first steam cleaner. It got my carpets cleaner than the model I rented from Giant, and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years. I did have problems when I tried to use the attachments. Water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected - might be user error. I will have to look for better hook-up instructions 
Works very well. You'll probably want to pre-treat the carpet and also boil the water to get it extra hot, if the hot water out of your tap isn't that hot. Once you do that it works extrememly well. 
I have a 9' x 12' area rug in my living room from Pottery Barn. With 2 cats, a dog and a 4-year old daughter, vacuuming was just not enough. This carpet was also beginning to smell like my dog after a big rain -- yuk! My husband was convinced that we should throw this carpet away. Boy, do I wish I took before and after pictures! Immediately after the first swipe I saw something magical. There was my beautiful carpet again! Aside from working wonderfully, it was easy to assemble and use. Of course, I would have loved a bigger water tank; I changed the water once on my 9x12' carpet, but that's really fine. Also, be sure to read the instructions. An area rug like mine should have plastic placed underneath of it to protect the hardwood floor while shampooing. I just took a few garbage bags, cut them and opened them up. And it was also a great deal. Sears had similar models for $100 more. Next I will buy the hardwood floor cleaner and scrub my floors with it 
After having read the positive comments, I purchased the F5914 from Amazon and it was delivered this week. I tried it today and I'm very pleased with the results. Even though my den just needed to be "refreshed", I was amazed to see how dirty the water was. I had brought home a Bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the Amazon comments were very negative so I returned it. The only negative comment would be that the writeup in Amazon is not correct. There was no bare floor attachment in the box. I had to order one from the Hoover Store. But that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine. 
I have really messy children. At the begining i thought about renting a carpet cleaner cause my carpets became very dirty i thought that nothing will clean them exept a commercial carpet cleaner but when i decided to start poty training them i found that i have to own one at home. It's really great, it cleaned my carpets, It's easy to use it's light. I use it all the time for the usual old accidents the new potty ones 
I rented the Rug Doctor to clean my area rugs on Memorial Day weekend and by July 4th weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years. I think it was due to the soap, although I rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after I used the rug doctor soap. I was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because I was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again. This machine is easy to use. I had absolutely no problems with leaking. I did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet. I used two scoops of Oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses. No problems whatsover. My carpets got so very clean. It extracts very well also my rugs dried fast. I am so happy that I purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at Amazon. 
My carpets feel and look brand new after using the SteamVac! I love how soft it feels, so I have been using the steamvac at least every 3-4 weeks. The suction is great, and my carpets dry super fast. I agree with the other reviews not to use more than half of the solution that is called for 
After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner. We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing. Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times. After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900. We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner. The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor. We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time. We are very happy with our Hoover. It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes. As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off. Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal! 
Since we heard nothing but bad things about hiring carpet cleaning services, we researched this SteamVac to replace that...our carpet had a lot of cat throw-up stains, and hadn't been shampooed in two years. This thing was amazing! It took out all the stains, and a ton of cat hair and dirt. We continue to use it for spot cleaning cat throw-up (yes, she does it a lot!), and it is easy to use and clean up. Very happy with our purchase, and now we can steam clean whenever we want without worrying about hiring someone to come into our house 
This bookcase was fast and easy to set up, and it fits perfectly in the small space I have for it. The one thing I would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves. But that's not a problem if you actually put BOOKS on this bookcase. 
I love this bookcase. My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split (a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it (excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal. Highly recommended 
This Mission Folding Bookcase is simply the best. Although I wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about 5 minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed. 
My husband and I purchased this shelf as a place to put my rather large collection of cookbooks. We received the shelf within days of placing our order. Upon opening, it took me maybe 10-15 minutes to take it from completely packaged to set up. We liked it so much after a month, we purchased a second one. We had the same positive experience with the second one. The shelf is attractive as well as sturdy and affordable ! 
The product came in a timely manner. It was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly. I'm glad I purchased it 
What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn. It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane! The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape. I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition 
it was great and easy to install. enough shelves for my stuffs. well it met my expectation 
I have bought 2 of these bookcases. They are very well made, set up in 2 minutes. Forget the pressed wood bookcases -- I have. They sag and fall apart. Not these bookcases. They are solid wood, the real thing, and best of all, there is no assembly required, just unfold where you want it, and start filling it up! Also, very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again. Excellent buy for the price. Not made in China, I think it is made in Vietnam 
I bought 3 of these. They are a great addition to my natural PC table and 2 bookcases that I already had. The price is great too 
I have had this product for over a year and the bulb just burned out. No cord problems, ever. I use it every night in bed and it does not disturb my husband. I have never had any problem with it. It looks like, from the other reviews, that maybe I just got lucky. Or, it's just that I have taken good care of it and never dropped it! If I dropped it, I would expect that it would break. I would highly recommend this product 
Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions 
I am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product. I purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and AC adapter about 5 years ago and I am still using it. I replaced the light bulb for the first time (replacement comes in the set I bought) last year when it started flickering and died. The book light has been used a great deal and I have accidently left it on for full nights before. I am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage...This is the only down side I can think of. The battery pack has its advantages... you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive. I prefer using the AC adapter. This might be why I never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time. It fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks. You can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want. Over the last year, my boyfriend has bought at least 3 LED booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them. He has been stealing my booklight to read with and I am force to use the poor night stand lighting. The funny thing is... I had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a LED book light. Now I am on this page again to buy another one for myself 
I have owned one of these little wonders for over five years. During that time I have replaced the lightbulb one time, which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required. For people who are complaining that the light feels "flimsy", have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light? It's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment, but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose. Imagine that! It's a moving part! Seriously, maybe they've switched to a different supplier (although I doubt it), but my light is a joy. It has proven durable over countless trips, moves, and drops. It provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you. Plus, unlike so many designs on the market, it is VERY lightweight. Some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit, so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read. I just don't understand all the negative reviews of this product. The only thing I can suggest is: try tightening those screws periodically. It will make a world of difference 
I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again 
Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me. I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight. If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons. Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly. Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries. This light is also extremely fragile. Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these! I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!) It is terrific! It has a clock with an alarm and a timer. You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes. At that time you can extend the minutes. If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off. It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light 
Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment. 
I bought this for my mother-in-law at her request. She has arthritis and saw it on TV. She also wanted the free gripper that came with it. I scoured the listings at Amazon looking for one that included the gripper, even paid a little more for it. She used the can opener once and it broke. The "free" gripper required sending away for it and an inflated S fee 
I purchased one of these for my elderly mother. It is very easy to use and works just as advertised! The only problem we have had with it so far is once, when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener 
Got tired of can openers that left little "burrs" or that were difficult to get started. Hesitant about buying a "As Seen On TV" product, but went for it. Works well, amuses my toddler and the dogs. Overall happy with product, hope it lasts 
We are very pleased with this item and tried to purchase another just like it but you were out of them at the time 
The worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address. That person now gets a slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it. (They also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well.) Be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this 3rd party company. Bad business and aggravating 
The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work. If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product. A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement. Paper weight in my min 
This is the worse can opener I have ever bought. It has failed four out of 6 times I have used it!! When it "fails", it stops "walking around the can" and you have to locate a little screw and get a phillips head screw driver and turn that till the opener releases your can! Needless to say, I am stuck with a useless can opener and am out $20 
Be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges...on the lid and on the can itself. Otherwise, it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space 
I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid. The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, "Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care." contradicting the prominent "NO SHARP EDGES" claim on the packaging. On a typical can, the opener struggles to complete its task, coming to a near stop at times. Of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life. It has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical 303 can about 1-1/2 times. For large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around. When the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can, there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can. There is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point, but if the reverse button doesn't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed, you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can--this manual release operation is challenging (and generally messy) to perform . The cutter--a sharp edged wheel--is not removable for cleaning, so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth (after removing the batteries). I recommend passing up this gadget 
As a tea lover for 30 years, I have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost-benefit and performance. I've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it's still working perfectly. It boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while. A+ 
My only reservation is for safety sake, it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless, because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet. 
. . . And we'll all have tea! That is exactly what this was meant to do. My wife likes to enjoy a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate when we are busy working outside in my garage workshop or doing what seems to be never ending yardwork. This is the perfect outdoor electric kettle to have on hand. We don't have to worry that it might break like a glass carafe would and we don't have to worry about turning it off. I just fill it up, put in on the tool bench, plug it in and wait for it to do its thing! All we have to do is sit down on the patio, admire Mother Nature and enjoy a good hot cup of tea! 
This kettle is amazing. It's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch (a light turns on to let you know it's working). It heats very quickly, 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea, it heats in about 3. For students in dorms, you can use it for oatmeal, soup, tea. Automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute, so no worries about fire hazards. Great product, I use it every day. 
I love and and bought one for my parents as well as my in laws....great for my morning tea. Favorite feature is the auto shut off, I can flip the switch, get ready for work and water is ready to pour. I don't have to worry about running to the kettle once the water has boiled. I highly recommend this product 
Great little gadget for heating water. I don't have to monitor it since it has an auto off. The water is steaming hot, great for a tea drinker like me. Great price too! I bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms. I have been using it at home so far. I am going to give it a spin (travel) this thanksgiving. Unbeatable, for the $10 I paid for it. 
The kittle looks good and I tried, it was not very fast but was accepted. 
This electric kettle is awesome,it boil water in no time.You can.t find any better one with this price! 
It's great for the price. So far so good. Heats water fast, light weight 
I love this electric kettle! I use it 3 or 4 times a day to boil water for french press coffee, oatmeal, tea, etc. I have not had the problems with the lid which others have mentioned- clicking it closed before turning it on is a no-brainer and I have never been splashed with water. It heats the water quickly even when filled to the Max level and the auto-shutoff feature has never failed. The size is perfect and the detachable cord is a huge bonus. I also feel it is sturdy enough. The light weight does not feel 'cheap', it makes it easy to handle even when full. Well worth the money; you will not be disappointed 
I have done a lot of dog training but I have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new. I have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do. Once they got the idea, they really enjoyed it. I am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled. This product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible. The teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog's natural instinct. I would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual 
THIS IS THE GREATEST! I had been pricing kits at about $1500 and more. This was the answer to my dreams. It is good quality, simple and is all you need for your dog to learn and have a great time 
Your Product's Name that really describes what the product really does! It is amazing that the Hair magnet really is easy to use and more amazing is the manner in which it preformes gathering pet hair 
This is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go. It's not a quick removal tool (think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming), but for things like wool dhurrie rugs, it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things. It really does pull up tons of fur, even from deep in a rug 
The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom 
As a military spouse, we move, and have different types of floors that need cleaning. I have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home, and also in our previous home abroad. The Vaccum side does not work well at all, but I prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how I mop. In comparison to sponge and rag mops, this leaves the floor pretty dry, and the suction is great. As long as you empty the tank and keep it clean, and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank, it works wonderfully. It's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers, that generally just push dirt around. I believe it's worth the $$. I've had mine for two years now 
The Bissell Flip-It saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop 
The flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did I know that I would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop. When using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where I stop, therefore I have to wipe up the floor with paper towels. When using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks! I have not recommended this product to anyone. A waste of $100.00 
I looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one. I chose the Flip-It for the price which was much lower and for the size. This unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around. I felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out. I have wood floors in the kitchen, nook, and foyer and I can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over. It's not any faster than mopping but it's much easier. My floors really clean and who wouldn't love that 
Product arrived on day promised. The cleaner was ordered by my mother, who is no longer physically able to keep her bare floors as clean as desired by other methods. She tells me that she is very satisfied with the product. It cleans the floor to her high standards with a minimum of time and labor. 
I bought this bark stop because my neighbor has a pit bull that stays out 24/7 barking, and the shared fence is about 15 feet from my bedroom window. The dog barks so loud, there is no where in my house that I can retreat to for silence. I bought this super bark stop in hopes of quieting the dog. The dog is so stupid that it barks even more when the noise starts up. So we turned the volume up so that the neighors hear it too. That's what did it. As soon as the dog started barking and the alarm sounded, the dog was brought in. That was until the neighbor broke it with a broom stick so we are buying another one. Too bad for them 
PEACE AT LAST!!!!! We have only had this for 4 days, but we are very happy. I ordered this because of RUDE neighbors who leave there 2 dogs(who bark and bark and.... they don't stop) out 24/7 is a dog run outside our bedroom window. Other neigbors have complained as well, they still won't do anything. After setting up the bark stop it didn't take long before they got the idea, they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing :) I called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs "trying to bark" I told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it, she thought that was great.( now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard) update 10/18 okay the real test came last night and again this morning.What was the test?? SIRENS!!! I just had to laugh, they couldn't bark and howl!!! All I heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them. I am so glad we bought this!!!! 
Not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs, but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing. After sitting out in a rainstorm, the Super Bark Stop shorted out and is now totally worthless. Find another product - You'll thank me later 
I have really loved this set. It looks great, cleans easily, and I love cooking with it. You really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking, but once I got used to that I haven't had any problems 
After 40 years of marriage, I have finally found cookware that lives up to its description. I enjoy cooking with these pots. They cook evenly and are a breeze to clean. The handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling them.I even like the glass lids that allow me to see what's happening without lifting the lid. I just recommended them to my daughter-in-law 
I purchased this cookware based on very favorable reviews and I'm happy to say that these pots and pans are great! Both my husband and I enjoy cooking and he's as happy with this cookware as I am. He keeps telling me what a great buy I made! I really like being able to cook at lower temps and I love the glass lids. Anyone looking for excellent cookware at a reasonable price should buy this product 
Bought this item for my daughter and she loves it. Threw away her old stuff because of this. Says in makes cooking enjoyable 
As most people do, I had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years. It was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great Cuisinart Chef's Classic set. I especially love the saute pan 
I was very impressed with this cookware. I was a little skecptical about the handles being stainless steel, because I thought they would be too hot to the touch while cooking. However, I have had no problems picking up the pots or pans by the handle while they are still hot. This is an exceptional buy for the money. 
Just got these about 3 weeks ago. They cook very well and I really like the see though lids. The only thing I consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the "rivet" that was used to secure the handle to the pan. Kind of a pain to keep that area clean. Overall very satisfied with the pans 
Wonderful set... also got the 12QT stockpot with this free... so very slickdeal :) Great nonstick coating, but you really must hand wash... but that is ok!! 
The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries. I had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries. Don't make this mistake 
Good combination. I keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have, no worry about changing batteries 
Accessory for the LED version of Zelco's excellent "itty bitty booklight". Assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days. 
This will be the third Thumper I've bought. Lost the first one on a trip, second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift. It's simple to use, loud enough to wake you and doesn't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes. The thumper pad is big enough to hit when you're groggy! More products should be as easy to live with as this one! 
Having problems hanging your family photos? This is the perfect product and inexpensive. Sooooooo easy... 
These are great. I hung a heavy picture using one of these hooks and it is still hanging. It was very easy to use 
Works as advertised. Can not be used if wall stud is directly behind use point. At roughly $1 per hook, a hammer and nail makes more sense 
I picked up a dozen in Home Depot for less than $5. Same concept, just a lot cheaper! Two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen. The hole they make depends upon the weight of what they're holding. I'm sure it's pinhole sized if you're hanging something that weighs a few ounces (in which case, you don't need this - use a pushpin!) The holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized, but it IS a heavy shelf. The hole is still WAY smaller than the hole I'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf. It also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks (the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang.) This is a small detail, but if you need two of these things and you don't do it right, your object is gonna be crooked. But on the bright side, you won't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it! Recommended product (but look around for the knockoffs. 
These Hercules Hooks are absolutely incredible. I wish I had them before my husband put many, many holes in our walls with anchors and screws. If I want to relocate anything, he tries to patch up the hole, but it always shows. These hooks make only a pin sized hole! I hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it. It is still there. Incredible product and well worth the price 
This is a excellent product.. as described very easy to incert and position... haven't checked the weight capability.. not disappointed 
These hooks are incredible!! I have used them throughout my home to hang heavy art work and mirrors, and the best part is that I can do it myself without waiting for my husband to get out his drill, hammer, leveler, etc. I love them so much we have given them as house warming gifts, and everyone that has received them from us has been as amazed as we are by how effective and easy they are to use! If you want a secure and quick way to hang anything on your walls without making a huge hole use these hooks! 
I am very pleased with this fryer. It heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods. Unlike most consumer grade fryers, this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries. Other fryers 'choke,' lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together. Not with this baby. I used a coupon, got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister. This was a great deal 
Bought ours two years ago after considerable research. Busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout. Not one problem yet. Best one on the market as far as I am concerned. 
this is a well thought out product for consumer use. easy to clean, easy to use. tried others and was very disappointed but i'm extremely pleased with this one. some advice stay away from the euro-pro 
I purchased this deep fryer after doing considerable research on-line. I wanted one with a good capacity and that would be reliable. It has surpassed my expectations. We have been using it for over a month. The initial use was to fry chicken tenders for a large party. 15 lbs. of chicken tenders were fried in no time with very little oil useage. Since that time we have fried okra, french fries, tater tots, onion petals, cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream. All have turned out very well. It holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil. This heats up in about 10 minutes. There is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature. Once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature. This produces crisp foods with no oily taste and very little oil useage. It has a breakaway magnetic cord to keep it from accidently being pulled off of the counter. It cleans up as easily as can be expected. I just put the basket and the oil resevoir in the dishwasher. The food can be lowered into the oil with the lid in place. This keeps oil spatters to a bare minimum. I have been very happy with my purchase. So have the hoards of teenagers that gather at my house. There has even been one instance when THEY brought the food and did their own frying. Although frying is not the most healthy way to prepare food at least with this deep fryer it is easy, quick, tasty, nearly mess-free and about as grease free as possible. While this one costs a bit more than others on the market I certainly feel as though I am getting my money's worth 
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge. After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon. In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. I must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful). Only complaint would be that the capacity is a little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time). But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue. It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect. I figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake. Although I've only fried a couple of batches, I am beyond pleased - but I'll let you know if I have any problems... Great item so far though.  
Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after. Very pleased overall. 
i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy. 
I purchased this for my wife. A hundred bucks for a knife insane! Until you use it. I think this is worth the money. My wife says is the best thing since sliced bread. And... you can slice bread with it. Seriously, great knife. It will last a long time. Don't keep buy cheapo knives year after year. Just get one of these. Very sharp edge, nice weight, and comfortable. 
After working with a combination of German knives for more than ten years, I decided to buy a Global knife and give it a shot. It feels great in my hand and is easy to handle and work with. The blade is incredibly sharp and has held its edge very well. All in all, I liked this knife so much that I decided I wanted more of them and bought the 6-piece set. I can't give it a much better endorsement than that 
I bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable. As a vegetarian, I use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless. Money very well spent as I know it'll last a lifetime 
I originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant I work at had one. I picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind. A couple weeks later I bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener. I have no idea what that other guy must be doing to his knife but my blade sharpens very easily and stays sharp for months as long as you don't abuse it. By far my favorite knife that I have used. One warning though: if you are going to do a large amount of chopping (like say you're a prep cook or you make Thanksgiving-like dinners twice a month) then the angled shape of the back of the blade may rub the side of your knife-hand index finger the wrong way. I cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday and have only been irritated by the shape a few times under heavy chopping regimes but it is something to consider. Overall I couldn't love this knife more. It's the most important kitchen tool I have ever owned 
I've been a German knife snob for years. But this 8-inch chef's knife by Japan's Global is the finest blade I've ever owned. Period. Maybe it's not as easy to sharpen as a Wustof or a Henckel, but then again, it holds its edge ten times longer. I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel. Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again 
bought a global knife a few years ago then bought the water/ ceramic sharpening device. cannot keep this knife sharp. it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels. I use the cheap sabatiers ($9 for the set and the block) anway it's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor 
I baught my 8" global chef's knife about 5 years ago. It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market. The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts. My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands. I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip. My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether. Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand. I highly recommend globals, but I might suggest the 8 1/4" heavyweight model, which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the Bolster. For more info on knife handling and care you might check out the CIA's book titled "The Professional Chef's Knife Kit". And one last comment. Although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe, please, PLEASE, don't put your knives in the dishwasher. 
I desperately needed a new knife because my old Chicago Cutlery wooden handle knife became a gross and nasty E. coli distributing piece of junk. which was very sad because I loved that knife! I had it for 20+ years. I ended up buying this knife because I really liked the look of the handle. It looked like it would grip well. and it does. To me it seemed a bit expensive, but the Stainless Chicago Cutlery knives handles were very smooth so there were few choices for me. The most important point is what ever brand you choose, go with non-wooden handles. don't make the mistake that I made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives. Bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick 
We have Sabatier and Wusthof sets but this is the first knife that every one of the family goes for first. Perfect balance, easy to sharpen, cuts meat, juliennes perfectly; even slices tomatoes. Pair this with the Global paring knife and really that's all you need. (Although my wife now wants her own for Christmas - clearly she's an incurable romantic) 
The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries. Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed. Then the LEDs started flickering. The next day, it was dead. To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head. But something on the little circuit board must have blown. The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book. I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least. Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better. I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions. I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out. This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money. They are a nice idea, but have no durability. If they were cheaper, it might not be such a big deal, but for their price I would like to see them be far more durable 
Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective 
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use. It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times. I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled 
I have looked over this product (it is a birthday present for someone else, so I haven't actually used it) and find that it meets all my expectatons for size, light weight, design 
Very well made reading light. Nice carrying case. Decent battery consumption. Fits most of the books really well. Happy reading 
NOT a good light. The light is already fading and I don't use it very often. Very disappointed 
I have tried a number of different battery-powered booklights and they all go through batteries in about 5 minutes. This light can be purchased with an AC adapter, eliminating the need to constantly replace batteries. It is bright enough to clearly illuminate the pages of your book, stays where it's clipped and reasonably adjustable. I love it 
The light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night. It would have been better with three for four LEDs 
I love this light! I spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book w/o disturbing my husband. It's also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs (like most other reading lights). Couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance 
So far I have been very happy with my Zo. I agree with others about the low baking temp...on med., my bread was much lighter than expected, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the loaf was undercooked. It was well formed and airy, just looked like I had baked it on a lower setting. Oh, but the shape of the loaf was perfect...looked like it came from a bakery (except with paddle holes on the bottom). The two paddles worked great, much better than my previous breadman and kenmore-no more scraping the sides-Ever! As far as needing more control, not sure why you would buy a bread machine at all. With my previous machines I only used the dough setting and baked in my own reg. oven...they weren't capable of baking an edible loaf. This machine does offer the Home Made settings that allows you to control rising time, kneading time, etc. If someone needs more than that, just make the dough in the machine and let it rise on your counter to your hearts content...hard part is done by the zo. Let's face it, if we were professional bakers, would we be buying a bread machine at all? Bottom line-the zo is an exceptional bread machine that offers more versatility than most, creates an attractive, well formed loaf, does a wonderful job of mixing the ingredients thoroughly with the two paddles, extremely easy to clean, and the zo has made it extremely easy to remove the pan-pull forward and slide out. I used to wrestle forever with my last one. One other note. Someone mentioned the pan warping...a little common sense will make this pan last for many years! Just read the manual. I have never had a problem with any of my machines, and this pan is significantly better than my last one that I used for 4 yrs. 
I bought this breadmaker because I wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf. It makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and I recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro. Nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen! I have not bought a loaf of bread since I've owned this fine bread making machine 
I've been using my Zojirushi for over two years now and make at least a couple loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread a week along with fancier breads using the dough function. I love the fact that there are two paddles to knead the bread, this works so much better than my machine of 10 years ago with just one paddle which often left gobs of unkneaded incredients. I also really like the horizontal full loaf pan. You can make normal sandwich loaves with this design. The one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting, rising and baking times individually. Sometimes I want the dough to rise longer than the preset times but there's no way of overriding it. Oh well, guess nothing is perfect. I highly recommend this product 
I have had 4 different bread machines, all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style. I didn't mind the bread they turned out, but I didn't like the loaf shape. My prayers have been answered! I can't quit making bread now! The loaves come out perfect, and if they don't I have come to relize that with bread it is typically the COOK's error, not the machine's. You need to really read the directions, which I find most people don't. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine, you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it. I've made all kinds of sweet, sourdough, french, italian, herb and cheese, fruit, and beer breads in the machine.....you name it, and they all come out just fine. If not, I tweak the recipe, I don't blame the machine. All in all, an excellent product. This is my favorite bread machine so far. The only down side is the sourdough setting. Don't be fooled... the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar. For true sourdough, you have to wait the 7-10 days. But if you can't wait.... Oh, and the "big viewing window". Unless someone installs a light inside the machine, you can't really see what's going on anyway. After my first 50 loaves I will let you know how it's holding up 
I own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year. I bake 1-2 per week. The machine makes excellent bread dough. I haven't bought a loaf of bread since I bought this machine. When I want a more crusty bread, make pizza, or make a foccacia I use the dough cycle with amazing results. Highly reccomend this product. P.S. It takes a little practice, if you never used a bread machine before. Read instuctions carefully measure ingredients. If your bread is slopsided watch for drafts. Most of my breads come out looking picture perfect the taste you can't compare it with store bought bread. Plus, no preservatives or additives of any kind 
I bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and I use it every day. The white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time. I've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs. I tried one wheat bread loaf ... it was very tasty, but not quite the consistency that I like ... so I need to play around with that one alittle bit. I've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before ... but now that my kids are grown up, I now have some time to work in the kitchen. I highly recommend this machine 
We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients. We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work. Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate 
There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get 
i have been using six second abs for a month. i can see my stomach getting flatter. so i wouldnt believe the commericals that say it took them a week to get a six pack but if you want a flatter stomach then this will help overtime 
Contrary to the opinion expressed in the previous review I found the resistance levels more than adequate. It might be that it was being used incorrectly by using the back and arms rather than pulling from the abs. I developed very good ab definition after around 2 months working out at 120 crunches on my back 3 times/week. Only problem was the machine broke when it wasn't even on the highest setting - but I intend buying another 
It's a great concept although resistance is almost useless. I'm in my mid-thirties and, although reasonably fit, have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them. Here was a solution which claimed to get around this. When I first got the unit, I gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable. I opened the front, replaced the yellow bands with the "heavy duty" orange ones and tried again - again, almost nothing. At 6 seconds a rep, 10 minutes gets you 100 reps. Don't know about you but although I could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense, I would certainly know about it the next day. I tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing. This makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they "feel the burn" very hard to believe. With that said, this isn't necessarily the fault of "As Seen on TV" that they sell this product - what's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although I can't imagine who. They did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10% restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a non-refundable shipping cost, it hardly makes it worth the effort. Am going to find another use for it - perhaps a coat hanger? Positive voters must be getting kick-backs from somewhere. Perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it. Don't believe me - buy one and find out for yourself. 
I gave this to my neighbor across the street who said he'd tried everything on his dog and had decided she was just a "barker." It worked immediately and completely. (I would only use it in ultrasonic mode because the audible mode will further annoy your neighbors.) Before I found this device I used a hose on a dog who barked under my window at various times of the night during the summer. I had to squirt the dog 3 or 4 times for a couple of nights and then the dog shut up. Dogs should sleep in the house at night. 
I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard. This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog. I could detect no effect whatsoever. Save your money, and try something else. I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking 
I used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy Australian Shepherds, one of them next door, and two more on the other side of it (so they were two doors down from me). I was skeptical, but the dog were driving us nuts. I installed a Bark Free (before the Super model was released), and the dogs quickly learned to shut up. It was remarkable. They would still bark once or twice if they got super-excited, but it stopped nearly 100% of their bored "I wish someone would let me exercise" barking. I only considered using the Ultrasonic mode. My only other word of advice is that a competitive product, the Dog Silencer Pro, is a worthless piece of garbage, and even in "Ultrasonic" mode, it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone, including humans. Avoid that one at all costs 
We bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously. I confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking, he told me if I had a problem with his dog barking to call the police, I did! He tried to have a restraining order put on us so we couldn't call the police, the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet, which he never did. So when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic. The dogs kennel is about 7ft from my garage where I hung it. The barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be. I have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also,apparently they don't like to hear it ! Too Bad, so sad! The dog gets used to it so every once in a while I unplug it for a day or so. When it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking. Plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference. It has really helped us where the neighbor wouldn't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking 
I was sleepless and willing to try anything. I mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor's back porch, where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly. Despite all my hope, I couldn't detect any change in barking with this device deployed. In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog 
I have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she didn't get her way, she was becoming intolerable, barking at all hours of the night, disturbing everyone around. She is extremely fragile, with a heart condition, and I felt a shock collar could kill her. I will admit I was very skeptical about this spray collar but I was desperate, anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train. So I tried the collar, and I am very happy to report it works, Tallys barking has returned to its normal level, which was infrequent, it happened quickly, within a few days, we followed the directions on the box, which are very important, and had good results. I can't promise this will work for every dog, but it worked well for ours,without resorting to shocks. I don't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work, although I do ocassionaly with Tally to refresh her training, I feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions, and you will get results fairly quickly. I am quite satisfied with this product 
He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again! It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why. When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long. It does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker. Terriers are just too stubborn to care if they're getting sprayed, I guess. 
The Premier collar was the best solution to help my dog restrain from barking without any injury to him!! He learned within a few days while on walks to stop barking at other dogs, when wearing the collar. I didn't want to use the shock method, but my groomer told me about the Premier Citronella collar to aid in his training. We got good results! 
Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered. I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all. They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless. Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged. Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless. 
My grandma's 10 year old Yorkie just would never shut up. He barked at our cat, at our parrot, and anything that moved really. We bought this collar, and it worked perfectly and immediately. One bark and it sprayed, and he would go running off...and stop barking! I felt kinda bad for him, but his reaction was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at him, poor thing. However, he did learn that if the collar wasn't on, he wasn't going to get sprayed, so he would bark 
I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that. So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a "blue juice special". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money 
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing. 
I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs 
I thought I'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix. I did not want to try a shock collar, but I was concerned that this collar would be too large for her (she's only 8 lbs). Although it looks a little large, she doesn't appear uncomfortable at all. And WOW did this work! The spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark - immediately. After the first 2-3 days, she is barking less in general and doesn't have to wear the collar all that often. It's been 5 days, and I don't think she will need to wear it forever. This product has been a total lifesaver, and my dog is happy too. 
This is a great product. We have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people, kids, bikes, dogs and pretty much anything. We use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car. We still use the collar once in awhile. We are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach. So far we like it a lot 
I have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for $20 (not on sale either - regular price). Same siz 
We use these more than any other dishware items in our pantry. They go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven. Plus, they are indestructable, whether dropped, banged in the dishwasher, or otherwise abused. They are pretty small however; U can fit a can of corn or heat up a chicken breast or two in the microwave, but not much more fits into it. We have 8 for a family of 4, and we could use a couple more if we had the space. So buy extras 
The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect. They are HORRIBLE! Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card. When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money. Bad, Bad Servic 
I only bought 2 and now wish I'd purchased 8. They are heavy and appear very durable. The lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal, actually much better than expected. Wait for them to reappear on the Friday sale and save a couple of bucks. I assure you you won't be disappointed 
It is the perfect size for a bowl to eat out of, it has a lid so it is good for leftovers or taking to work, and having a handle is great. There are no worries about taking a hot dish out of the microwave: you just grab the handle and eat. Probably, ideal for teens or college kids. Also, they also hold up well. We have a couple that are about 10 years old, and recently bought some more on Amazon 
I love the grab-its! They are wonderful. I was so disappointed when the outlet store I used to buy them from told me that they no longer make these. So, I am thrilled that I was still able to find these online and with the lids!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH! 
i've got one of these floating around my house (without the lid) with the other "common" (shared) dishes.. and i have to say, everyone loves this one. i think it's great b/c of the handle, more than anything else. college students like handles on their dishes 
I bought this to use for "brown bagging" but have used it for so much more. THis little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks, all without having to change the contents to a "dressier" dish. French White is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money 
I love these dishes, I bought these because I need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white, they mix with the set beautifully! I like the feel of the classic Wedgewood bone china so I'm glad they priced this set so I can afford to use them for everyday dishes. The packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes, but surprising everything made to me in one piece, so I'm very happy with my purchase 
I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware. Best set I have every owned or used. Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots pans. The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top. I paid $24.99 for this when I bought a few other pieces. Got free shipping $25.00 off the order 
It works great and I like being able to use metal spoons. It apears to be of great quality 
Very pleased with the quality of this pan, good weight and cooks food evenly, clean up is easy too. Good product 
This was my first calaphalon purchase and I am so impressed that I plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future. This pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.The unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food. Hand washing the pan is easy. I love this pan !! 
LOVED this pan; I got several others too. Price was much below average 
I am so over nonstick--even Calphalons. I have been gradually replacing all my nonstick with uncoated cookware. This Saucepan really rocks. I use it all the time. I don't have to worry about scratching it, and I really haven't had much trouble with clean up. 
I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since. I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review). The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles. The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again. Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot. Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes. 
I like the size and shape of this saucepan. It is big enough for something like spaghetti sauce or even mashed potatoes, but not so big is overwhelms smaller jobs. Cleans up nice and the lid is good 
I bought this for Mother's Day for my Mother and Mother in law and they both have said that they are still going strong. I was a little skeptical at first but they came though. Oh and for the other reviewer who wrote they are cheaper on Wal-mart is correct but shipping is almost $20, so this is a better deal by far! I liked this so much i am sending it to someone else 
This is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants. It would make a great gift as well 
Sent to my daughter in CA for her birthday. She loves the gardenia. The service was excellent. Thanks to Frances, Emily and My-An 
I bought this bookstand at the beginning of 1L after a lengthy search and lots of testing. This bookstand is metal, and it has a rubber serrated grip to hold the base of a book in a variety of positions. For me, this is a key feature b/c I use the bookstand at many different locations, and I use desks and tables of different heights. I adjust the main angle w/ the stand in the back, and furtther adjust the book's angle by wedging the spine into a rubber slot at the base. I should note two other benefits. First, for a year and a half I've put 1200 + page casebooks in this book stand and it's never bent; and I can get the spines of those casebooks to flatten out with the stabilizer arm. Huge ++. Second, I can lean into my casebooks and write in the margins. This bookstand support my upperbody weight. I don't think you'll find a plastic stand, or a wire stand, that will do that. In sum, if you're in law school, this stand will be your best friend. Your neck muscles will appreciate the investment 
After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs. Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was. This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back. Any of my school books are not stably supported. I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages. Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00). Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you. 
This book stand is an absolute necessity if you're a college student, and even if you're reading for leisure. I love having my hands free to drink a coffee or snack, or anything else I want to do. 
After recently returning to school, I was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one's neck, especially while trying to take notes at the same time. After looking at several other book stands, this seemed to be the best choice. I haven't had any trouble with my textbooks - both hardcover and softcover. Even if you're not experiencing neck pain from reading, it's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself. It also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well. I'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well 
After reading the one review on this site I ordered the bookmate and eagerly awaited it as I was using a Fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks. When it arrived I was sorely disappointed. The back support for the book measures only about 7"x7" and the depth measurement for the book is 1". Any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7"x7" is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand isn't big enough. In addition, because the depth is only 1", forget any book with say over 500 pages. At least the Fellowes stand has a back support of 12" x 9", its deficiency is its page holding arms. I can't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook, as perhaps this amazon category is targeted, could use this bookmate usefully 
I first bought one of these at Barnes Noble, or maybe through Levenger about 5 years ago, lost it traveling and spent hours and hours and hours searching the web, going to stores etc. looking for another one, but it was out of production. I bought other book stands in the interim, and looked at countless pictures of others but none came close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this little guy. Tne design is near perfect. It folds up, so you can flatten it stick it in your book. It has little feet that hold the pages of even a realy thick paper back down. It's flat surface balances on just about anything (I balance it on a pillow when I'm reading in bed). It adjusts to different angles. It's is a near perfect design. I've given this as a present and the response is always the same - "How did I ever live withouth this?" If you're a reader, DO NOT HESITATE. My motive for encouraging you? If more people buy them, they'll never go out of production and I won't have to worry about losing mine ever again. Absolutely essential for readers. 
In principle, this should be a great product. We got one and set it up in a few seconds. Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking. (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.) Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit. That one worked great...for 5 days. Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund. That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer. Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer 
We have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device. We ordered the Bark Stop Pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking. We were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we're very thankful that this device works. You have to use the high frequency for the big dogs. We would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog 
It appears that the Viatek product (Bark Stop Pro) is related to the Lentek design (PC16 ; ASIN: B0002Q89O6) - they are based on a common design by a Lentek engineer. I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the "Audible" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the "Ultrasonic" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc. This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work. The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks. 
I bought the bark stop about 2 weeks ago. I had read several reviews either really good or really bad so I was quite skeptical, but my dog (jack russell terrier) would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house, so I was desperate. The most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there aren't many things that are both great and easy. When you buy treats for dog to train him, do you simply leave the treats out all the time. No. Because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to. It's the same thing with the bark stop. The first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off. I found that doors shutting hard, clanging dishes, etc all set it off. So, if the device goes off every 5 seconds, the dog isn't going to think for a second that it's going off because he's barking. He's going to assume that it's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with. So after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting, I decided that I would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage. Also, I never leave the device plugged in when I'm doing dishes slamming doors, or doing loud things. So the dog only hears the device when he barks. I realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works, but I would rather do that than have a barking dog. The way I look at it, is I wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training, so why leave it plugged in all the time. In the end, the first time I plugged in the bark stop, I let the dog bark it out. He barked for about 5 minutes (normally 10-15) and then stopped. The second time I plugged it in, he didn't bark more than twice. The bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in, so I think that now he knows when he's going to hear more than he wants to. I think that the dog has now gotten more used to it, and will try to out bark it, but for the most part, he doesn't bark much at all while it's on, if he barks at all. The one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house, usually this device won't help, which I think is a good thing. Cons: When I was testing the microphone (used for taking in the bark loudness) on the device, it didn't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low. Also, this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off, not to manage each bark, but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on, or to click it off 
The money tree arrived today on time. It was a gift to me :) I opened the box and couldn't believe how perfect this tree was. I'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon. Especially for the holidays. The roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree. Thanks 
I have ten dogs and eleven cats plus I volunteer at a local rescue group, and I always keep a couple of bottles in my medicine chest. Two of my dogs use it all the time: a golden retriever with allergies and a cocker spaniel with chronic ear infections due to severe neglect in his previous life. Zymox with hydrocortisone has an enzyme that promotes natural healing plus the hydrocortisone takes the itch away so they don't scratch themselves raw thus prolonging/enlarging the infection. I also use it on the ocassional yeast or bacterial infection (you don't even have to guess what kind because it works for both), twice a day for a couple of weeks takes care of it without having to pay a vet's examination fee 
My dog had ear problems for years and finally came across this product. Cleared it up in one week, with only a couple of applications. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with chronic ear problems 
My chihuahua has had chronic ear problems since he was a little puppy. I'm not a fan of the antibiotic ointments that vets prescribe because they contain medication he doesn't need for his yeast problems. I've tried all sorts of natural ear cleansers to no avail. I found this product highly recommended by an online vet site so I thought I'd give it a shot. Within 2 days his ears looked perfect...no scratching or shaking either. It's been 3 weeks since I last put in the drops and I haven't had to worry about them since. I honestly can't believe how well this solution works. I'm so happy my little guy isn't feeling miserable with his ears anymore. : 
used vet's RX to treat my dog's ear and it didnt seem to work. After reading reviews I decided to try this . After only 1 week I noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better. would recommend to others 
My beagles have chronic ear infections and I was spending hundreds of dollars per year to keep them in check - doctor visits in order to get the prescribed (and expensive) mal-otic. Zymox Otic has solved the problem, keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when I started it. Be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection. 
irecently purchased a bottle of zymox with hydrocortisone for my lab who has had several really bad ear infections i was spending a fortune at the vets office.i searched the web until i read about this product.i decided to give it a try.im sooooo glad i did.this works !her ears are clear ,she is happy again.i will keep buying this product.thank you zymox 
This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there. Zymox takes about a week to work, with one or two treatments a day. It has had the same effect for my sister's dog who had had recurrent ear infections. I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success 
My 10 yr old Cocker Spaniel has had cronic ear infections for 4 yrs. She has developed a resistance towards most antibiotics and steroids and all antibiotics make her stomach sour. Some antibiotics even make her ears worse! Nothing works completely, but Zymox seems to give her a reasonable comfort zone. Without Zymox, expensive total ear canal ablation surgery would be her only option. After expensive TPLO surgery and 4 years of ear infections, my finances have been exhausted. Zymox has given me better results than the vet, saves $150 a month vs the vet, and is well worth the daily ear cleaning and drops 
I read about Zymox on a vet's website regarding chronic ear infections. My black Lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when I found her. The usual story of rounds of antibiotics, including expensive Baytril, without resolution of her problem. It's been almost a month now and her ears are improving. I find that I cannot skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs, but if done daily she has little goo. I plan on continuing every day and I hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns. Zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics 
This is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver. I am purchasing another one because it's working so well. I am a professional dog trainer, and all I can say is that the product is great, but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed. As a professional dog trainer, I still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers. Our toy poodle was essentially house-trained when I was home, but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out, she ended up peeing in front of the door, because nobody was letting her out. So, I got the Lentek Door Chime, and taught my dog to use it, and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear. We also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in. Everybody is happy. Now I'm getting another pad for upstairs, because we still have oblivious teens and hubby.... So, great product, but be sure that you have *both* parts of the product, and give a good trainer a call to help you get started. 
I was really hopeful about this product working. I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8. I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button. They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it 
It takes a little patience to get the dog to use it, at first she thought is was a treat machine, but eventually she realized it meant go outside. Works very well. 
This is very misleading. this item is only half of the package. after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work. very disappointed in amazon for allowing this 
Easy to use. Our dog learned how to use it reliably in a couple of days. No directions came with it, we called our trainer and asked how to do it. 
I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well 
I hung 2 big jingle bells on a sturdy ribbon by the door it accomplishes the same thing with no batteries to worry about! Consistantly ring the bell before opening the door and he'll learn in 2 or 3 days 
We love our pet chime. It took a little time to train our dog on it but now it's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out. It's also a great conversation piece when company is over. We've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and haven't had any problems. We're getting an extra paw 
In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw two additional paws. I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks. In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek. They're great, IF THEY WORK 
I've used the Itty Bitty Booklight for years. The 2nd edition is a welcome improvement. It's much easier to turn on/off, and the light stays in place after months of use. (The light on the Original Model tends to swivel after time. 
Dear Customer Service, I am please about the refund; I am please about all thinks that I purchase from you. The web page where I bought: Zelco "itty bitty" Book Light, Volume 2 I believe is not clear. By looking the page I had the impression that I was going to buy a mini lamp where I was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a LED lamp. At list this was my impression. Sincerely, Adrian 
I am looking for a new book light, and as a former owner of this light, I was suprised at the bad bulb stats. This bulb, like halogen bulbs, get very hot. It is imperative that you do NOT touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it. The oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp. and hastens failure. Hope this help 
I own two that include the ac adapter. They are great bright lights. I used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily. Replacement bulbs are not hard to find. Don't bother paying for high priced Zelco bulbs. I bought my generic replacements at Walmart in the area they sell flashlights. I use rechargeable batteries. They probably last 8-10 hours on a fresh charge, maybe longer. I've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period. I put it on the visor. The lights are very bright. In some circumstances they might be too bright, but that would be a weird complaint for a light, huh 
This book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person. I use it with the converter so I can plug it into the wall , but the battery adapter works well for travel. I have also used it to read in the car. I wish the wiring was a little heavier, as this was where my former light failed, but it lasted for several years with regular use 
I bought this light for my wife several months ago. There have been absolutely no problems, and it even seems to be holding up better than my original itty bitty book light. I would get this one for myself if I decide to get another one, but I'm also checking out the flourescent one, which is supposed to never need a new bulb, and you can hardly find the bulbs for the regular ones anymore, unless you go to Zelco's website 
O.K., buy this poster if you like spooky things but don't say you were not warned. You are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around. This is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books. The movie encompasses several of the first books of the series. And the poster is indicative of both. You will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster. I suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box. Placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum). Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count. Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them. It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count 
Glad to see they still make this clock. Yea, the parts are simple but I love the way it looks on on my wall. I even changed the dots when I moved. It used to be on a white wall, now it looks even COOLER in my new place w/ my own white dots on a GLASS wall. The one I had for 10+ years just died. I'm ordering another one. Hopefully, it'll last as long 
Clock is smaller than I thought, and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall. Made of cheap materials, definitely not worth $25 
I was searching for a juicer for a long time and was contemplating the Jack LaLanne Juicer which my brother had. I came across this and was a little skeptical, but after making the purchase I am totally satisfied. I like the stainless steel construction, it is very well made, solid and sturdy. It comes apart very easy, and most of the time you just need to scrape out the left over and rinse with hot water to clean it. I can't believe i have gone so long without juicing, i've never been much of a fruit eater other than apples and bananas, but since buying this product I have made apple and carrot drinks, watermelon and cantaloupe, its great. I actually feel the difference inside within a short time. I read one review that this juicer leaves juice left over in the pulp, but i did not find that to be true. I think it all depends if your trying to force the fruit through to quickly. It you don't press to hard on the chute feeder and let the machine do the work the pulp is quite dry. I got one Litre of cantaloupe juice from one cantaloupe. I went out and purchased some 1 liter bottles and i just fill them up so i can mix and match to my aquired taste. I got 3/4 of a liter from about an 1/6 of a full water melon. Anyway i am thinking of purchasing one for my friend and his wife as a christmas gift. Great Stuff. 
It's hard to find anything wrong with such a damn good juicer that I only paid $25 for. What can beat that? Money very well spent. It does spray a little depending on what you're putting in, but again what juicer doesn't? I can live with this for $25! Wear an apron duh. It does say in the manual that it doesn't do wheatgrass, I missed that bit, but no biggie! I can cope for only $25.. Carrots, beets, celery, cabbage, ginger, cucumber, peppers, apples, pears etc, all hard veg and fruit are just perfect, it does these really well. I adore Oranges done in this juicer, with all the pith on they come out so creamy! Not acidic like regular OJ. I'm still hooked, got my juicer a few weeks back and I'm still using it daily. it's awesome 
I'd been looking for a good juicer for a number of months, but had shied away because they're expensive. I saw this deal, read and analyzed the reviews, and rolled the dice. It arrived yesterday, and after easily disassembling it to wash the parts and get to know it initially, I ran a half dozen carrots through it. OMG!! Fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen! Clean-up was easy (well, I was an old pro by now) and quick--under five minutes. To address some of the negatives you may read, first, size: of course it's big. They're all big and bulky. It's their nature. Second, residue: my carrot pulp was DRY. I suppose if I'd put it on the floor and stood on it I might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it. Third, it's factory reconditioned: for me, that's a plus. Consider this: the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line, each one eye-balled and polished by QC before bagging and boxing, assuming that they are all good to go. But, a factory re-con is gone over from top to bottem, inside and out before it's released. No assumptions--the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again, so you know they'll make sure they don't. And if it'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem, I can certainly live with that considering the discount I'm getting. I'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away, but Waring is an old and trusted brand, and the juicer is not cheaply made. I'll be back in a year (hopefully not sooner) to give some time perspective to this review. As soon as I finish writing this, I'm ordering two more as Christmas gifts. 
Though I have not tried the juicer yet, but i could not pass off the price 
I am very happy with it: inexpensive, easy to clean and nice-looking. Highly recommend 
I've wanted a juicer for a long time, but could never really justify the expense, knowing that I'd very likely quickly tire of the maintenance involved. When I saw this juicer for under $25, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed with the unit's solid construction. You can see right away that this isn't a plastic piece of junk that's going to break righ away. With the unit's first use, I juiced: cabbage, kale, spinach, carrots, onions and peppers. The unit - while not as powerful as more expensive models, I'm sure - juiced up everything with no hesitation. I would describe the pulp to be damp, but not what I'd call really wet. I dreaded the juicer clean-up process that I'd heard so much about. Disassembly of the unit is a breeze. There are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of thirty-seconds. No problem. If there's one thing I could change, it would be a better designed pulp-catcher that would allow a bag to be used. This is only a minor gripe and has in no way made me regret the purchase. If you are a casual juicer, looking to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money, this would be a perfect choice. I'm still amazed that I got this for under $25 and I'd recommend it without hesitation 
I would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone! It is stylish, sleek,easy to clean, and has plenty of power to handle anything. I feel sorry for michigan, mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink! Awesome! Awesome The first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol' prune who wouldn't be happy with anything! Get it now! 
I'm absolutely thilled with this Waring! It's definitely changed my opinion of juicers. I purchased the reconditioned model. It arrived factory (re?)-packaged and looked brand new. Not a single mark on it, not even a fingerprint! It's far easier to clean, obviously by superior design: the parts clean up like new in the dishwasher. The components fit perfectly, despite probably a couple hundred uses. It's exponentially faster, and the remainders are noticeably dryer. (As another reviewer mentioned, this refuse obviously indicates a very efficient juicer!) Looks, sounds and functions like a very upscale appliance. No spraying, no movement, no juicer "drama"! :-) Absolutely the best one I've owned and after lots of uses, it's still going as strong as it did when it arrived. 
As this is a consumable food product, I'd like to know what each color is made of. ??????????? 
This food coloring was the best I have ever used. It is very concentrated. I obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time. I did not notice a flavor at all so I look forward to trying the black. The bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish 
I bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing. The Ateco food coloring gave nice bright, vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well. I was totally satisfied with the purchase 
These are easy to use, they do not make a mess, and offer vibrant colors. They do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can. I would highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate 
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us. I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability. The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy. The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option. I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button. This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this. I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary. The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs. But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me 
Purchased to replace our constantly broken intercom system. Installation is a matter of pushing a button so even I was able to do it and I love the fact that I can carry the station to the washer or outside... wherever. We also bought the outdoor station and put it at the front. Now when I'm outside, I don't have to worry about not hearing the doorbell 
I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter. I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly. 
I think this is a greater product. Unlike other intercom systems I've bought this one is wireless and the sound is clear 
I purchased 2 of these cages and my first comment is that the picture of the cage is just what you are getting. It is hard to find a large cage for parakeets with the correct bar spacing so no one slips out. This cage was the answer for all of our needs. Not only is the bar spacing great for our paratkeets but there is lots of room. The stand that the cage sits on is very sturdy and does not wobble like a lot of cages that come with seperate stands. Assembly is also easy. The only time I had to pull out a tool was to put the stand together and that was very easy to do. If you are using this cage for parakeets you should use twisty ties to secure the doors even more. Parakeets love to lift the doors up and down and it is a matter of time before they realize they can also get out. The cage is also very nice for our parakeets because it has different levels that the birds love to explore. Great cag 
Junk, junk, junk.  Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service. Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever. This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website. We purchased Cuisinart, works great 
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor. It is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance. It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time. The egg beater attachment is excellent also. I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all 
The best Salsa, The best Pesto, and Salad dressings made with this food processor we all should have one 
This is a terrific machine. Amazon's price beat everyone, especially with their 20% promotional discount, no sales tax and no shipping charges. The oversized feed tube makes pre-processor preparation much simpler as I don't have to try to "fit" my ingredients into a narrow tube. Clean-up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully-sealed motor/base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses/messes. It's quiet and efficient. I only wish that there were more outlets (hear me Amazon?) that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level. Overall, I am highly satisfied and happy I spent a little more and got the best 
This is our first food processor. Did a lot of looking before making this purchase. It's easy to use and clean. Made Salsa with our garden fresh tomatoes the day it arrived. Makes slicing a breeze. Great price from Amazon! No complaints of any kind 
This is the best kitchen appliance we own. My wife has saved more time with this appliance. Very strong motor, nice look. Our garden is all choppped up 
very happy with the proformance of the processor.made the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done great.the pizza still needs to be worked on lol.all-in-all,fantastic product 
The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl. A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying. The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised 
I loved this item until it became fused to the base. I called CS and they sent me a prepaid UPS label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a $50 off coupon to keep using Kitchenaid. Very impressive 
Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday. Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun. My father tried to contact them and nobody responded. I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund. I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist 
Hey guys get these flowers and score some points.........!!! they looked good and smelled great. my wife was impressed .....oh by the way send them to her work...... 
When the person got the flowers she really liked them. She talked and talked about them. She also was suprised in a good way how long the flowers lasted (roses). I ordered flowers from them for Mother's Day because of my experince. Great job 
Showed up on time, with a cold pack, wraped in a box and a phone number to contact and the person who inspected it. Very nicely done

I surprised a friend with these flowers. They arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo. Even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses. To bad that they are not shipping in Romania. Update: After 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice. I am so glad that I could make someone happy with these very nice roses 
my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box. the roses were dead and black. she thought i was mad at her. do not buy. i repeat... do not buy 
I am very disappointed. These flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store. I ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked. I buy roses alot, and I know what a fair cost is for good quality. If you're paying less than $30, beware 
I checked the ProFlowers site and it said I still had 3 days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before Christmas. It's now the day after Christmas and they still haven't gotten them 
The flowers not only arrived in good time, they were also so lovely. My friend, who loves roses, was very impressed. Definitely a great purchase 
the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more... anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money... 
I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks. I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT" 
Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product. If you decide to purchase Super Bark Free, be sure it's returnable for a full refund if it doesn't live up to its claims. And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product 
I had so many barking dogs that I was feeling like shooting them. My rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog's disruption of the neighborhood (some kind of power thing I guess). When ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill. When my last short term renter (a pastor) yelled NO! at them I became desperate. I had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs. I was looking for a new collar (cironella) I plugged in anti bark, and then up popped this Super Bark Product. I bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree. The dogs barked the entire time right at the fence, until my daughter turned it on. They ran like bats out of hell back to their house and haven't been heard since! Now I was a little sceptical at first, but I can't praise this product enough. You can not get anything else that will do this for you. You can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win. If you move, you might end up with more barking. Look. It's worth the money, believe me!!!! 
I turned the device onto human sound because on sub-sonic, I didn't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning. The device itself on human sound was triggered by many things, air condtioner, mower, air plane, thunder, etc. which was not good in that I doubt it would serve as an effective training device. The dogs seemed to trigger it at random times. We have large lots here in this area of NJ and I placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem. HOWEVER, my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole I placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs' outside times. She advised me that her book clubs (inside) and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly. The capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation. I would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone 
We have four dogs, and they're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking. One of our neighbors "strongly suggested" this product as a possible remedy. I did some investigation before purchasing, including talking to the manufacturer. Their sense was that it works for about 50% of dogs, which is in line with what I saw in other on-line reviews at the time (this was about a year and a half ago). Anyway, because they had a good return policy I went ahead and made the purchase, and it worked wonderfully. The barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it, and in fact we wished we had bought more (we have a very big yard). That led to our downfall: we were moving it around frequently, and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch. Oops. Needless to say, it didn't work after that. But, remarkably, the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months. Now the grass is green, the buds are blooming, and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive, so it's time to replace the unit. This time I'm buying two, and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer. 
This unit works great.. for a couple of months. I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog 
I was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product. Our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie,(the barker) and our collie, (the follow-up barker) before investing in yet another "bark deterrant". We have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound,while also using the reinforcing "Quiet". After observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days, we are ready to purchase. I am sure that it probably won't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days' or in households that are very active, but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that "wound up" frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason. Considering the $50 cost in comparison to some products in the $100 range which quit and had to be re-purchased immediately to not break training continuity - check with a trainer, boarder or groomer and test it out first. We are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house 
I was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my Itty Bitty Book Light.....and at such a reasonable price. Fast shipping too 
I bought this device one week ago and I like it a lot. It counts steps pretty accurately, I measured it three time and I got the following results: 401/400, 101/100 and 897/900. The first number is what it showed, the second what I walked. Basically accuracy at 1% or better, which is exceptional for this price. I use the least sensitive setting. The backlight is very nice and by tilting the device a bit more one can see the display clearly at night. The clamshell design is also nice and practical, avoiding pressing buttons accidentaly (and resetting for example a day's steps). Now, do not buy this device for the FM radio. The reception is pretty poor and the quality of sound when you get a signal is what you would expect from a device costing as much as this. Plus I guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function. I do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism, but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more. In conclusion, this device has a good price for what it gives, although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy, but definately do not seem as sturdy. Personally I like this device a lot and I highly recommend it (pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries) 
Excellent pedometer for the money. Worthwhile investment. I only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity, and now it works great. Radio works great also.. Definately reccommend 
This pedometer is great. It's very small and very light. I forget it's even there. It keeps me motivated to walk more and the radio is wonderful for walks around the neighborhood. I have dropped it a couple of times, but it has not damaged the Pedometer at all. It's a great product and I definitely recommend it 
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want" 
I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking. I pushed the manual button and still nothing. It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute. It was a complete waste of my money 
I picked this up after reading the 50/50 reviews. One of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away. The other just wandered around and took no notice. Neither seemed scared/bothered at all. This product had zero affect on our dogs' barking. I'm going to return it 
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now 
I have a 3 1/2 year old Boxer that barks, cries, whines, and howls when I go to work...ALL DAY...I know, I recorded it. I went to Petsmart and picked up this gadget. Brought it home and it the manual correct button. She bolted. She hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes. It reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and I don't crate my dog when I'm going to be away for more than 8 hours. So if I'm just running out for a few hours I stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if I'm going to work I use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar. My girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it. Worth the price in my opinion. Best advice is to take it home and try it. Some dogs react to it. Others don't 
My beagle (13 mo.) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time. Does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks, not smaller barking or any form of whining (even if extremely loud) 
Our dogs didn't even notice it. We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers. I was wrong - the kept on barking.. 
I have a very actiuve Border Collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything! I tried all the training methods I could find and nothing worked. I then purchased a Citronella spray gadget ($$$) which did nothing. (I think she liked the perfume.) I was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices ($$$$) but just in time my nephew lent me his Dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog. I can't recommend it enough 
Dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them. The device I received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity, some don't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them. I had a chance to try a different brand years ago and I know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison. If you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten. There you go, suicide by dog, that's a good use for it. May be it is just quality control, you might get lucky, if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won't return calls or e-mail, like i did. So you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad. Go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones. I hate being cheated. Score another point for the bad guys 
it requires effort from owners. Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior. When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from. We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much. They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands. So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here. Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either. My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean. Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.  My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention. My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself. Not sure I would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on walks..just in case. 
I have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping. It is very out of control and this device didnt help at all. I know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar. A friend has one and recommended it to me. They are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me. The dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them. 
I was amazed at how much I am enjoying my Flavia Fusion. I saw it at a boat show and tried some. My husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I really love it. I love the decaf house blend. It is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf. Decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it. The Flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee. I also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well. I like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks. It surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research BEFORE buying it. It is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee. The Flavia is a luxury item, not for a poor working stiff. Anyway, the Flavia is fast and simple and convenient. In fact, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now. Enjoy it 
I absolutely love this machine! The selection of coffees and teas is wonderful. I am a tea drinker, primarily Engish Breakfast and Chai latte, and I am quite picky about the quality. With some of the pod brewers I have tried, the tea has been quite weak. However with the Flavia, the Engish Breakfast tea is very good. The Chai is excellent as well. The Chai latte is very smooth and doesn't have the peppery taste that some can have. Pros: 1. Great tasting coffees and teas 2. Great selection 3. Virtually no clean up 4. You can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea doesn't taste like coffee (very important) Cons: 1. You better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen. This will only happen once, trust me, because you will not want this to happen again. 2. You can only purchase coffees and teas through their website. Hopefully as this machine becomes more popular there will be more options for purchasing 
What a quick easy way to make a great cup of coffee. I like to mix the packs up and make my own brew. I have freinds that love the machine and went and bought them one. This is the best coffee machine we have ever owned.What I like is I can mix the diffrent packs and make my own brew that you cant get in a coffee shop or at the store. HINT. get the Vanilla Syrup pack and add it in the mix 
We have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee. At long last, it has arrived in the form of the Flavia Fusion! This is the easiest, quickest, most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make. The unit does have a large footprint, but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger. Set up is simple - remove from box, insert the filter, fill it with water and plug it in. Thats it. Once you "prime" the system (pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch)you're ready to go. Insert the beverage packet, adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel, push the button and voila! Since the water is preheated you get a hot, delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds. If you get the "medley" pack (value $29.99)you also get a free travel mug. Contrary so what some reviewers have said, it DOES fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray. The medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you don't like it. The "creamy topping" is a must have for any special "indulgence" drinks you want, a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like Starbucks, which it does. This is a fantastic time saver in the morning, and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person. As for clean up, there are two words.."what cleanup?". You take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage, simple as that. No more filters to buy, no more pots to descale, no more throwing out half of the pot that you didn't drink. Just amazing. 
This machine is wonderful! I first tried Flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the Mercedes dealership. Best coffee I'd had in a long time. It's so nice to walk into the kitchen, insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot......whatever I feel like! This machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets, whether they are teas, coffee or chocolate. I would recommend this to anyone 
I love this machine. Each package is its own brewing system. That means that there is nothing to clean, nothing to clog, and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other. I love strong coffee and I found even the House Brand to be full flavored. Most surprising is how good the teas taste. You actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea. The herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor. The only disappointment was the hot chocolate: It was basically just as good as Swiss Miss. The frothing packages do work, but I get just as good if not better from skim milk and a $2 gizmo from IKEA. They are nice to keep on hand. The Milky Way froth does give a nice caramel flavor. The big down side is you can only get refills from Flavia. They have recently started giving free shipping on orders over $100, so stock up and get the free shipping. My big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir: I have accidentially run out of water more than once. The machine does 'spit' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup 
I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine. We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do. This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it. Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our "standard" mugs. The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with "frothy" drinks than coffee and tea). When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it). The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem. The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have). Flavor-wise: It's made by M/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent. Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like "French Roast" and "Sumatra". Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains. Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly "splashy" drinks. No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug. Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there. Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch. Between pods that need "pre-wetting" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia. We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly "indulgence" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use. Certainly easier to clean up after, too! If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia. Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia. I'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic. Highly recommended 
This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee. That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives 
Granted, it is a bit noisy at first (more like a shocking sound, not so much noisy), but you get used to it. The mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill, especially if you've never used any of the larger office machines. This was a complete first for me. I mixed a few, watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes, but I got the hang of it and love it. I commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at $2 to $3 a cup, so there's a huge savings in this product. And the tea is the best I've ever had. They actually add juice concentrates in the pack (some selections), so the tea is very flavorable. The machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter, but I think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home. It will always stick out at first. I bought black and it looks great. There really isn't any cleanup at all. Other machines I looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons. This really is so simple. Finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter. Because the packs are bigger than most pods, it is a challenge. I ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry. The round display rack that Flavia offers looks pretty neat. I will definately buy that. Over all, it's a perfect product in my opinion 
only problem i have with it... is that the plug doesn't go all the way into the power supply.. which seems a little bit unsafe but works grea 
It was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than don't fit (although the bottom feet, which you do have to assemble, had to be forced in order to fit). It's also quite attractive. I should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures, because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is. It's nice to see real wood, but I am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff Ikea sells is more environmentally friendly. Finally, you can't beat the price. 
This is functional, yet very nice to look at and is extremely easy to put together. It holds alot of DVD's or CD's and looks nice with any deco 
This is my third mission collection item, and it lives up to the other two. You can't go wrong with this collection. I use it for picture frames on a small wall that seemed too empty. It took nothing to assemble and is great looking! Highly recommended 
We have one, like a couple other reviewers here, in the dark color; we've had it for probably a couple of years. We love it! With our ever-expanding DVD collection, we went back to Target to get another one, and now all they have is natural. Can't seem to find the dark wood one anywhere online either. Can anyone help?! PS - I checked ebay too, with no luck. I'm guessing nobody's selling theirs because they love it so much 
I have one in a dark color. I can't find anymore anywhere. Anyone know if they stopped making the other color 
I think this item is a great buy. Well designed and very functional although I use it for my DVD's instead of CD's. However, my DVD collection has extended beyond the capacity for one tower so I'm seeking to buy another but I wanted another dark walnut tower since the rest of my book shelves and my DVD tower I've gotten from Amazon are also in this color. Is there any way of finding this item in dark walnut 
For quite a while I had been looking for a certain type of DVD rack/tower...then one day in Target I was looking at the Mission collection and saw the box (no display). It is exactly what I had been looking for. Slapped on the two foot ends and done! Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon 
I bought this steam vac a few weeks ago and have used it 4 or 5 times already on different areas of my carpeting. I had little problem putting it together and have had no problems with leaks. (And I am known to be mechanically challenged) I was most mystified by hooking up the hose and stair attachment but even managed that without great angst. I followed instructions by first using my regular vacuum over the area that I was going to clean. Then I used the steam vac and the results were amazing. The steam vac did a good job on the areas where my elderly dog had peed a few times over the past six months. And the rest of the carpeting looks great after using this machine. Since the carpeting was last (professionally) cleaned Oct 2005, I cleaned some areas twice. I could not believe how much yucky dirty water kept coming out of the carpeting. Also, the attachment that I used on the stairs brought up an amazing amount of dog hair-and I had just vacuumed the stairs with my Hoover Windtunnel. It's true that the tanks don't hold alot of water. I had to fill the tanks 2 or 3 times to adequately clean a 10x15 area. On the other hand, if the tanks held any more water, the machine would have been too heavy for me to easily use. Also, per other reviewers, I boiled water to fill about half the tank, then filled it the rest of the way with really hot water from the sink. Maybe that helped to get such good results. I was most amazed how quickly my carpeting dried- in many places withhin a few hours. Last year, it took several days for all of my carpeting to completely dry after being professionally cleaned. Quite frankly, I think that the carpet looks just as nice now after I cleaned it myself. I couldn't be happier with my purchase 
The Hoover F5914-900 is my first steam cleaner. It got my carpets cleaner than the model I rented from Giant, and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years. I did have problems when I tried to use the attachments. Water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected - might be user error. I will have to look for better hook-up instructions 
We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners. They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking. We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet. We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews. I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America. I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together. We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack. I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job. Ok...our Hoover came. My husband put it together and it leaked all over. I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them. By then we had already taken it to the repair center. After a week they had not touched it. My husband picked the machine up and brought it home. We decided to start from square one and put it together again. He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!! Yeah! My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman. So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first 
Works very well. You'll probably want to pre-treat the carpet and also boil the water to get it extra hot, if the hot water out of your tap isn't that hot. Once you do that it works extrememly well. 
I have a 9' x 12' area rug in my living room from Pottery Barn. With 2 cats, a dog and a 4-year old daughter, vacuuming was just not enough. This carpet was also beginning to smell like my dog after a big rain -- yuk! My husband was convinced that we should throw this carpet away. Boy, do I wish I took before and after pictures! Immediately after the first swipe I saw something magical. There was my beautiful carpet again! Aside from working wonderfully, it was easy to assemble and use. Of course, I would have loved a bigger water tank; I changed the water once on my 9x12' carpet, but that's really fine. Also, be sure to read the instructions. An area rug like mine should have plastic placed underneath of it to protect the hardwood floor while shampooing. I just took a few garbage bags, cut them and opened them up. And it was also a great deal. Sears had similar models for $100 more. Next I will buy the hardwood floor cleaner and scrub my floors with it 
After having read the positive comments, I purchased the F5914 from Amazon and it was delivered this week. I tried it today and I'm very pleased with the results. Even though my den just needed to be "refreshed", I was amazed to see how dirty the water was. I had brought home a Bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the Amazon comments were very negative so I returned it. The only negative comment would be that the writeup in Amazon is not correct. There was no bare floor attachment in the box. I had to order one from the Hoover Store. But that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine. 
I have really messy children. At the begining i thought about renting a carpet cleaner cause my carpets became very dirty i thought that nothing will clean them exept a commercial carpet cleaner but when i decided to start poty training them i found that i have to own one at home. It's really great, it cleaned my carpets, It's easy to use it's light. I use it all the time for the usual old accidents the new potty ones 
I rented the Rug Doctor to clean my area rugs on Memorial Day weekend and by July 4th weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years. I think it was due to the soap, although I rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after I used the rug doctor soap. I was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because I was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again. This machine is easy to use. I had absolutely no problems with leaking. I did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet. I used two scoops of Oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses. No problems whatsover. My carpets got so very clean. It extracts very well also my rugs dried fast. I am so happy that I purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at Amazon. 
My carpets feel and look brand new after using the SteamVac! I love how soft it feels, so I have been using the steamvac at least every 3-4 weeks. The suction is great, and my carpets dry super fast. I agree with the other reviews not to use more than half of the solution that is called for 
After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner. We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing. Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times. After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900. We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner. The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor. We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time. We are very happy with our Hoover. It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes. As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off. Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal! 
If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside. As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product 
I have a hefty tortoise-shell Manx who is constantly shedding. I saw the commercial for this product, and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals, and just had to have one. Boy, was I ever disappointed! When I try to brush my cat with it, the teeth just float on top of her hair... they don't even go down into the undercoat. Maybe it's because she's chubby, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work for her. I'm left handed, so I had to turn the blade the other way on the handle. Maybe I'm not using it right. I'm still very disappointed. The animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them 
i got this for my cat (ocicat breed). he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes. shedender worked just like the commericals. one brush and fur goes flying everywhere. it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back. as u can see in the picture the tool is small. if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool. if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead. i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price 
My three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush. She gets persistent dandruff and furballs but won't let me touch her with any other brush. I have tried about every kind of brush but she hates being groomed! So imagine my surprise when I pull this brush out of the package and she actually lays down for me to groom her after a few strokes! The only downsides to this product are: 1. the small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all the fur ends up on the floor or you are emptying it every few strokes 2. the "front" versus "back" positions - cats do not generally stay in one place, I have three and they roll and walk around while I groom them. It was a bit unconvenient to constantly switch the brush from my left to right hand to get the proper angle to de-shed my kitties. I don't know how this could be improved but it is a downside to the product. Overall it's defineitely worth the 10 bucks I spent, my Boo-boo never lets me groom her with anything else 
This product does what it claims. I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well. The downside of the product is the size. It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it. They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more. I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator. I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal. It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat 
I just received this product today, and I already love it. I ordered it for my cats. It works as great as they said it would 
I have a long haired Ragdoll cat. He is a constant shedder. My husband saw this and bought it for me. My cat hates being brushed so that is the challenge. But when I do it you can see the difference. I end up with a pile of fur and a much shinier cat. He doesn't seem to like it but he will escape for any brushing so I think that's just him. Having to go only one direction is a bit hard because the cat is so stubborn but I can see the difference around my house. I used to have to clean the furniture daily with a roller and now it is every few days days and no where near the amount of hair that used to get on there! I recommend this for any long haired animal! 
This bookcase was fast and easy to set up, and it fits perfectly in the small space I have for it. The one thing I would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves. But that's not a problem if you actually put BOOKS on this bookcase. 
I love this bookcase. My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split (a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it (excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal. Highly recommended 
This Mission Folding Bookcase is simply the best. Although I wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about 5 minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed. 
My husband and I purchased this shelf as a place to put my rather large collection of cookbooks. We received the shelf within days of placing our order. Upon opening, it took me maybe 10-15 minutes to take it from completely packaged to set up. We liked it so much after a month, we purchased a second one. We had the same positive experience with the second one. The shelf is attractive as well as sturdy and affordable ! 
The product came in a timely manner. It was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly. I'm glad I purchased it 
What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn. It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane! The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape. I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition 
it was great and easy to install. enough shelves for my stuffs. well it met my expectation 
I have bought 2 of these bookcases. They are very well made, set up in 2 minutes. Forget the pressed wood bookcases -- I have. They sag and fall apart. Not these bookcases. They are solid wood, the real thing, and best of all, there is no assembly required, just unfold where you want it, and start filling it up! Also, very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again. Excellent buy for the price. Not made in China, I think it is made in Vietnam 
I bought 3 of these. They are a great addition to my natural PC table and 2 bookcases that I already had. The price is great too 
I have had this product for over a year and the bulb just burned out. No cord problems, ever. I use it every night in bed and it does not disturb my husband. I have never had any problem with it. It looks like, from the other reviews, that maybe I just got lucky. Or, it's just that I have taken good care of it and never dropped it! If I dropped it, I would expect that it would break. I would highly recommend this product 
Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions 
I am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product. I purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and AC adapter about 5 years ago and I am still using it. I replaced the light bulb for the first time (replacement comes in the set I bought) last year when it started flickering and died. The book light has been used a great deal and I have accidently left it on for full nights before. I am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage...This is the only down side I can think of. The battery pack has its advantages... you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive. I prefer using the AC adapter. This might be why I never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time. It fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks. You can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want. Over the last year, my boyfriend has bought at least 3 LED booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them. He has been stealing my booklight to read with and I am force to use the poor night stand lighting. The funny thing is... I had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a LED book light. Now I am on this page again to buy another one for myself 
I have owned one of these little wonders for over five years. During that time I have replaced the lightbulb one time, which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required. For people who are complaining that the light feels "flimsy", have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light? It's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment, but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose. Imagine that! It's a moving part! Seriously, maybe they've switched to a different supplier (although I doubt it), but my light is a joy. It has proven durable over countless trips, moves, and drops. It provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you. Plus, unlike so many designs on the market, it is VERY lightweight. Some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit, so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read. I just don't understand all the negative reviews of this product. The only thing I can suggest is: try tightening those screws periodically. It will make a world of difference 
I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again 
Okay, I haven't used this while reading in bed yet...but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting, it's great! The light isn't good for areas that are adequately well-lit, so don't bother to use the light there. But in areas where light is dim, the light shines. Literally. It casts a bright light on the page(s) that you need to view. It's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading. Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag. Imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go. The power adapter, however, is a cumbersome brick. As for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for, I can't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative, not consecutive hours. So, no complaints yet about that. Whenever I saw this light online or in the store, I used to think, "Why in the world would I ever want something like this?" Now, my thoughts are: "Why didn't I ever think to buy this before? 
Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment. 
The item didn't work at all. As a matter of fact. My dog didn't even flinch when I tested it right next to her head. No, she's not deaf either. We yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine. The item actually melted in the sun (it still worked though). I was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun - oh well - lesson learned. I'm not trying to sound bitter but don't waste your money on this item. I'm gonna try the shock collar next. Maybe I'll have better luck. Thanks anyways, Mik 
I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate. It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page. The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed. So, functionally, it gets a solid A. But I wasn't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries (two of those round watch/calculator batteries). Replacing them is a hassle (though inexpensive) because I have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before I leave, and I have to find them in a store with an electronic department. I wish this light took AAA or something. The light does include batteries, so you won't need to worry until you run out. For me, that was probably around 20 hours or so 
Very nice and handy product, I whish the light was little bit more and brighter 
I purchased one of these for my elderly mother. It is very easy to use and works just as advertised! The only problem we have had with it so far is once, when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener 
Got tired of can openers that left little "burrs" or that were difficult to get started. Hesitant about buying a "As Seen On TV" product, but went for it. Works well, amuses my toddler and the dogs. Overall happy with product, hope it lasts 
We are very pleased with this item and tried to purchase another just like it but you were out of them at the time 
The worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address. That person now gets a slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it. (They also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well.) Be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this 3rd party company. Bad business and aggravating 
The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work. If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product. A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement. Paper weight in my min 
This is the worse can opener I have ever bought. It has failed four out of 6 times I have used it!! When it "fails", it stops "walking around the can" and you have to locate a little screw and get a phillips head screw driver and turn that till the opener releases your can! Needless to say, I am stuck with a useless can opener and am out $20 
Be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges...on the lid and on the can itself. Otherwise, it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space 
I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid. The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, "Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care." contradicting the prominent "NO SHARP EDGES" claim on the packaging. On a typical can, the opener struggles to complete its task, coming to a near stop at times. Of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life. It has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical 303 can about 1-1/2 times. For large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around. When the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can, there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can. There is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point, but if the reverse button doesn't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed, you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can--this manual release operation is challenging (and generally messy) to perform . The cutter--a sharp edged wheel--is not removable for cleaning, so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth (after removing the batteries). I recommend passing up this gadget 
I bought this electric kettle and while it did heat water very quickly, once I opened the lid the whole pot of water reeked of plastic. Needless to say, the water was not drinkable. I don't know if I was stuck with a bad unit but I would not recommend this electric kettle. Buyer beware 
As a tea lover for 30 years, I have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost-benefit and performance. I've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it's still working perfectly. It boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while. A+ 
My only reservation is for safety sake, it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless, because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet. 
. . . And we'll all have tea! That is exactly what this was meant to do. My wife likes to enjoy a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate when we are busy working outside in my garage workshop or doing what seems to be never ending yardwork. This is the perfect outdoor electric kettle to have on hand. We don't have to worry that it might break like a glass carafe would and we don't have to worry about turning it off. I just fill it up, put in on the tool bench, plug it in and wait for it to do its thing! All we have to do is sit down on the patio, admire Mother Nature and enjoy a good hot cup of tea! 
This kettle is amazing. It's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch (a light turns on to let you know it's working). It heats very quickly, 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea, it heats in about 3. For students in dorms, you can use it for oatmeal, soup, tea. Automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute, so no worries about fire hazards. Great product, I use it every day. 
I love and and bought one for my parents as well as my in laws....great for my morning tea. Favorite feature is the auto shut off, I can flip the switch, get ready for work and water is ready to pour. I don't have to worry about running to the kettle once the water has boiled. I highly recommend this product 
Great little gadget for heating water. I don't have to monitor it since it has an auto off. The water is steaming hot, great for a tea drinker like me. Great price too! I bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms. I have been using it at home so far. I am going to give it a spin (travel) this thanksgiving. Unbeatable, for the $10 I paid for it. 
The kittle looks good and I tried, it was not very fast but was accepted. 
This electric kettle is awesome,it boil water in no time.You can.t find any better one with this price! 
It's great for the price. So far so good. Heats water fast, light weight 
I purchased this gaming/entertainment center for my son when he was only 3. He has a 13" TV/VCR and an original Nintendo system with lots of games. I thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic, easy to put together or move, and holds everything I needed it to. This item is not something an adult would want to have in his/her living area, like one of the reviews I read. I mean Step2 is a company that makes a lot of products for kids. Anyway, my son loves this product, and so does his 2 year old brother 
I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room. He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a "20 inch" TV. If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!! I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!! 
Man this item is fantastic. I love wasting $80 on pointless furniture. Getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems.... Man I must be in heaven. Not only that but it breaks easily, does this thing have no limit? So I bought this great video center around a year ago.... And what happens it breaks. I had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap. It looks like you're in a baby kids room. Similar to those play centers in day cares or McDonalds. Man that is lame.... I just love having children decor in my house, and it has to be $80. If I were you.... I would just let my systems, TV, and CDs sit in some tubberware. Believe me it would be 50X safer! 
i bought this video center for my son for christmas as well a ps2 to store and at first i did not think that it would fit in the drawer part but it did but the ps2 games do not fit on the top left and right slots because of the length of the games however they do fit on the sides where you would put the vhs tapes and that is where my son has added his games so you would have to be a little creative with it. i had seen a review where a lady had bought this item for her son and she was very disappointed once she could not place the games in the slots and stated not to purchase. everyone out there! do not listen to that its a must have and it does help with organizing your room area! and the price at the time during the holiday season i could not resist for $71.99 plus free shipping! WOW! 
We thought this was very handy storage. It holds all our video equiptment just right 
This looks like a great organizer, but with you people that have a x-box ps2 game cube and a dvd player you can buy cd cases that music cds come in and place the ps2 xbox and game cube games in those along with the dvds. It would be a bit of money depending on how many games and dvds you have though.. 
I was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep. My eight year old son and I managed to get the unit put together, after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place. We carried it up to his room, and put the T.V. and V.C.R. into place. My excitement turned to bitter dissapointment, however, when I tried to fit my son's PS2 games into the shelves desighned to hold CD's or VCR tapes. The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model. The whole reason I ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room, so this will not work for me. I will probably try to return it, and order the newer model 
This was a one on one replacement for an original that lasted over 10 years. The product works well and our experience lasts a long time 
I bought the toaster because Consumer Reports said that it was the best buy and they recommended it. I also did a search for the best buy and found it at E-Bay. I used it for the first time this morning and am very pleased with the product that I bought 
This toaster works great for me, but then it is just toast. This particular toaster was given a good rating by consumer reports so I bought it. It works just fine for me, but how hard can it be to screw up toast. Enjoy 
Great toaster. Consumer Reports (online 2006) gave it a great rating. I also have a Krups top rated toaster and they both do a fine job. Both recommended. This one was given to a family member as we don't need two very-good toasters. The recipient, upon seeing said, "Wow! That's red!" 
I love my KitchenAid 2-slice toaster. It is the best I have had, and I have had a lot of brands throught he years. It is tall and has wide slots to hold bread of every height and width. The heat adjustments are easy to use, and I love the bagel function for thick-sliced bagels, english muffins, etc. I love the removable crumb tray too, that makes it easy to keep clean. I love it. I am very glad I bought it. 
I ORIGINALLY PLACED AN ORDER WITH ETRONICS THROUGH AMAZON, BUT AFTER 2 WKS. AND THE PRODUCT HAD STILL NOT BEEN SENT I CANCELLED THE ITEM... TO DATE WHICH IS 1/18/07 I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A FULL REFUND.. I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AT SEARS AND IT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST IN TOASTERS.. THIS PRODUCT THAT MARKETPLACE HAS ON AMAZON IS A SORE SPOT WITH ME.. LIKE I STATED 2 WEEKS AFTER PAYMENT AND THE ITEM WAS STILL NOT EVEN SENT OUT AND THEN I AM INFORMED IT WON'T BE RECEIVED BEFORE CHRISTMAS - AND I NEVER RECEIVED MY $12.93 BACK FROM THE SELLER - ETRONICS.. SO WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS YOU GO TO A STORE AND YOU PURCHASE IT FOR THE SAME AMOUNT AND I KNOW THAT WAS LUCK.. BUT BE LEARY OF THIS COMPANY BECAUSE THEY IGNORE ALL OF YOUR EMAILS AND THEN THEY DON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY IN FULL.. I AM STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK. 
I bought this toaster to replace my cheap $10 Toastmaster, which held up for more than 10 years [it was still working when I tossed it in favor of this name-brand toaster]. The sliding shelf that holds the bread in place is made of a very thin, soft and flimsy steel. After only 2 years of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism; and it could not be fixed. The shelf is hooked onto the slider by 2 small prongs that ultimately broke off. I am surprised that KitchenAid would sell a piece of junk like this 
the look is shiny and retro and it stands out in my friends' kitchen. works well, the bagel and warming functions are much appreciated - 
No matter the number of napkins, this holder adjusts to hold them neatly. And you can even fold down one side so that it becomes an L shape to hold a large stack. It looks nice on the table, too 
My husband absolutely loves this tie rack. It's classy and functions perfectly....the ties are easy to hang and don't slip off in his cluttered closet 
I bought this tie rack for my husband. He previously used an electric rotating tie rack. The product looks and is exactly as described, but you have to lift up the top ties to get to ties on lower rungs so it is a little awkward. However, for the price it is a good deal. Also, the ties do not fall off like they would on a coat hanger 
My husband has so many ties, and he was hanging them all on different hangers, and they would fall all over the place, and he could never find the one he wanted. So I got online to find him a simple rack to keep all his ties in one place, but I didn't need anything with lights or a motor to rotate it. This has been great- simple, meets the purpose, he can now keep all his ties in one place and they don't fall off! Now I can use all the hangers this tie rack frees up 
This friction tie rack which holds 24 ties, is simply THE BEST!!! Purchased six of these to share with friends. You won't be disappointed! Stylish,functional, it works and works well !!! 
This little thing works great. I already owned a circular tie holder, but over the years I had accumulated so many ties that they started falling off. I read the reviews and decided to buy this one to help me organize my ties. I was very pleased with it. In fact, I'm buying a second one and plan to get rid of the circular tie rack since this one works so much better. 
This is very easy to use, and it makes everything very easy to clean, so you wouldn't think it taste so great being a pod, But it works great taste great and creates a nice little cream, The machine I am using is a Gaggia 97001 Coffee Deluxe Espresso Machine with Automatic Milk Frother, Silver, if you like strong espresso you will love this. 
I've had this set for about 4 months now and so far they aren't too bad. I really like the color. I looked everywhere for blue to match my pattern. I'd say they are worth the money. If you do a lot of cooking that calls for a "heavy" saucepan, these aren't for you. I like to make candy around Christmas and these didn't work well for that. I also found that when I boil water in them, they still have marks on the bottom afterwards no matter how hard I scrub. Maybe that is just part of the seasoning process, though 
This is NOT a 3 qt. tea kettle. It clearly says on the box 2 1/2 quarts. I returned it 
Great size which stores several loaves of bread or bagels. Cutting board gets stuck sometimes 
Very nice bread bin! I was pleasantly surprised that the stainless steel bread bin matched my Cuisinart items (coffee maker, toaster oven) perfectly. The finish is a brushed stainless rather than "shiny" stainless. It looks very nice on my counter top - much nicer than the old bread basket with bread hanging out everywhere. It's also very roomy. I also like the cutting board, as I'm forever digging under my kitchen cabits for a cutting board! 
The box is quite attractive, and the cutting board is thick and heavy, which helps weight down the box itself, which is made of rather thin metal. This is a step above the $30 range Polder boxes that don't have the bread board. I use a plastic cutting sheet over the bread board to keep it in good condition, and am quite happy with the overall quality, and the fit and finish. It looks nice sitting on the counter. I got the box primarily to keep my Lab mix out of the bread products, and so far it is working for that. 
I bought this pitcher for the pleasure I get just by looking at it. When I was little my grandma had one in her kitchen that I would stare at during meals. As I age this memories are important to me. Of course quality is great and it doesn't drible. Got the scarlet because of it's more contemporary look. Take a look at my customer image above and check how pretty this piece is. I'm sure you'll get one too 
No wonder Fiesta wins so many design awards. This pitcher delighted the receiver and me as well 
I bought this to give as a gift, but I had to admire it for a few days prior to wrapping. I just love Fiesta. All the colors and shapes are wonderful. The pitcher came fast and in perfect condition 
It does function well, hmmmmm... kinda like a pitcher, and looks great as an accent with my black appliances 
I actually have several of these pitchers and love them all. The handle is well balanced and it is an attractive item to set on the table 
I started my fiestaware collection in November of 2002 when I was first introduced to it. I started my collection with a sunflower and persimmon disk pitcher, and a persimmon teapot to complement the colors of my casual dishes. But after seeing how beautiful and durable fiestaware is, it became a collection that is being enjoyed and used every single day. I now have a lot of the serving pieces plus 30 5-pc place settings--2 sets of each in 15 different colors. I love them. Once you get hooked on fiestaware, it is hard to stop especially when they keep coming out with these new beautiful colors 
I decided to add this pitcher to my Sea Mist collection since Fiestaware is discontinuing the color (much to my dismay). I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is. Sea Mist is much more beautiful in person, and so is the pitcher. It not only matches my other Fiestaware pieces, but is an item that I can use in any room of the house. I can see it displayed on the mantle, in a bedroom, the bathroom, as well as the kitchen. If only Fiestaware would continue Sea Mist....I could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display 
As a longtime collector of Homer Laughlin's Fiesta, I can say this pitcher might be the apex of design. It is form AND function, beautiful and sturdy. The colors never fade, and you never have to worry about a chip. The range of colors is outstanding. I have one of these in every color except black ( black to me was never a good Fiesta color ) and I use them all. Great at parties to have lined up in a row with different drinks in each pitcher. I use Fiesta exclusively on my table at home and always get compliments. 
I hadn't used Amazon before and did so at the suggestion of my sister. Amazon had the products that I wanted, at good prices, and the ordering process was easy. I did have the need to return an item, due to an error on my part. I followed the return procedure and it went smoothly, without a hitch. Very convenient. 
And when it came up on my Gold Box offers, I couldn't resist ! And it is great !! Heavy duty without feeling too heavy, this pitcher makes any occasion a bit more special !! And it looks great in my yellow kitchen to boot !! Stylish, slightly retro and looks beautiful ! What more could you ask ? 
The Mario Batali lasagna pan is the best pan I've used. It is extra deep so it holds really thick layers of all the good stuff I make my lasagnas with. It weighs a ton since it is enameled cast iron, but that is why it cooks so evenly. I recommend adding about 15+ minutes of extra cooking time to your recipes because the oven does have to heat the heavy mass of the pan. Cleaning was easy. Just soak it in hot sudsy water for a while then all the baked on cheese and sauce will wipe off with a kitchen scrub pad. The only surprises were that the rim of the pan has no enamel. It is bare iron. But it cleaned without a problem and did not rust when soaked overnight. This is a great pan, but it is very heavy when empty and even heavier when filled with a lasagna so make sure you've got some stong helpers around to put it in the oven if necessary. :o 
With a fairly intensive effort on my part in the "hint" department, this was a Christmas present. It is one of those presents that you really actually like the more you use it. I like it a lot. I've made five or six lasagnas so far and a few dishes like manicotti. All of them were cooked evenly and it behaves like a "non-stick". Tonight I made a nice 5-layer lasagna that brought it up almost to the top with no overflow. It is 3-1/8" deep from the inside bottom to the top edge. Compare this to 2" for your standard Pyrex 3 qt 9x13 dish. It cleans easily, has a nice color and a nice finish. It still looks brand new. 
Spent over 80 bucks for the lovely lasagna pan. Yes, it's heavy, but it's a wonderful pan. I found it VERY irritating that the free recipe book didn't include "whole" recipes. Within the recipes it says things like: 2 cups basic tomato sauce (then, "See pg 71 of Molto Italiano cookbook"). Well, I don't own that cookbook and I certainly think they could have printed the entire recipe... otherwise, what good is it 
This came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the Holidays. As a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation. As a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb. chickens. It's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck. The pan looks good from oven to table. Yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron, but I'm really glad to add this to my pantry. 
I used the new pan today to high heat roast a 4 pound rib roast at 500 degrees. The oven and pan were a mess, but the pan deglazed beautifully with wine and 3 hours later, with no soaking, cleaned up with little effort. It still looks brand new. Now if only my oven did... The pan is really nice for the money. The only surprise is that it is very burnt orange in color. On my monitor I couldn't tell the exact color and was hoping it would be more like Le Creuset's Flame, but it is not. Muted and wonderful for autumn serving, but definitely orange. Of course, I did use it for a holiday party tonight but I didn't serve in it. I bought the dutch oven too with the total being 139 with the free shipping. My roast turned out great, bt 
Big enough, Deep enough, for Heavy Duty Eaters..Buy one you will love it. 
This is a great looking 9x13 pan with good proportions. It is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna. It is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna. Its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven, but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done. I have made many other things in this pan with great results. It is fairly non-stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas. The enamel is fairly bulletproof. Overall I really like this pan, with its only weakness being heft. However, that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table. You won't be disappointed 
Works great...the doser is kind of a pain sometimes, but totally manageable. It does a great job on the grinding and that is why I bought it. Bought this with the Gaggia Carezza, and together they make great Espresso 
I recently reviewed the Gaggia espresso maker I bought when I got this grinder, and mentioned the grinder in that review. My views on this grinder are simple: buy it if you are the type that is hands-on, because this grinder requires it. You need to be right there, watching, tamping the beans (especially if they are oily, but usually even if they are not) into the unit, making sure the grind goes into the pockets inside the catcher and all that, the entire time. Much like the espresso maker itself, it does what it's supposed to do and does it well. But for $200, I would prefer a more automated process 
I bought this grinder a year ago, and we use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. It produces a consistent grind, is very easy to change from an espresso setting to a coarser setting for drip coffee. Dosing takes practice as you have to think about how long the grind has been running to know how much you've produced. I highly recommend this product. I fully expect it to last many years. The only complaint I have about it is the area that holds the puck is too close to the doser. 
I've had this grinder for over two decades and it has performed well. When I first got my machine, I wondered which setting number would be good for cappuccino, or any particular grind. The manual said that since coffee can vary from variety to variety, or even from one roast to another, it's a matter of adjusting to each batch of beans. Perhaps with 34 settings, people have found that to be helpful, but I have found my beans to be consistent enough that adjustments are necessary for type of coffee, but can be left alone for a particular type of coffee and a particular variety of beans from a source. At the time I got the machine, I got my beans from Peet's back when they had five stores and no other distribution channels. Although they are a larger chain now, they are still small enough that roasting can be well controlled, and they can still buy beans from a single source for a variety to meet the needs of the chain. For beans from other sources, where roasting is done at a variety of locations, or from beans from differing sources, you might need to pay more attention to adjustments. A much bigger issue that affects strength and everything else is the dosing. From reading the other reviews, it does not seem to have changed since I got my unit. The top of the unit can be filled with beans, and the part over the dispensing area will fill up with a remarkably consistent grind. That round area is divided into six sections, like a wheel with spokes. Five of the sections get filled with grounds. One section is empty, and is above the dispenser. Each time the lever is pulled, the wheel rotates one position clockwise, and one section gets dispensed through the empty section. In theory, if the unit were full, the amount of coffee in each section would be consistent. Chances are that in real life, you would not want to fill the unit up for home use, since the grounds would not be fresh by the time you use them. If you grind just enough for a few cups, then the coffee will not end up in the compartments evenly, and dosing by counting pulls will not work. If you lift the lower lid, you can see where the coffee is, and you will likely see a small mound in the back and partly filled areas toward the front if you grind smaller amounts. You could redistribute things with a brush, but even that way, some areas would end up more compacted than others. Or you could merely gain the experience to know how much was dispensed compared to how much you need, and pull the handle accordingly. Another option is to gring with the lower lid off. As you watch grinds fall into the compartment, you can rotate as each compartment gets filled, dispensing as you go along. Then you can become consistent once you develop a good eye for it. Whether you want to consider the dispenser poorly designed is a matter of perspective. If you believe that this unit was designed to grind beans for two cups of coffee, then it would be a fair conclusion. If you believe that this unit was designed for people who prepare 6-12 cups an hour, you might think that it's just fine. If you believe that it was designed for a higher level of fairly constant use, you would probably not be disappointed. But since this unit is most likely for home users, it's hard to claim that the dispenser is ideally suited to the task. Experience will let you know how high the grounds are supposed to be when you put them in the filter basket, and it's not going to take you long to learn. While this unit is not fool proof, chances are that you are not a fool, so things will work out. For me, the bottom line is that once you know the correct grind setting for your beans, the unit is more "set it and forget it" than what the instructions said, at least with consistent beans, but the dispenser is a lot less "set it and forget it" than what the literature implies. Personally, I prefer a unit that takes the guess work out of getting the grinds to be the right consistency, since it's easy to get the amount dispensed right by eyeballing it. This unit does very well in that respect. I use this in conjunction with a Gaggia Coffee (now known as Gaggia Classic; the new Gaggia Coffee is a different machine) and the two make a good pair. Learning how much coffee to dispense is a minor part, compared to learning how long to hold the switch on the espresso machine, or how to froth milk perfectly, but ultimately, it boils down to knowing how to make a proper espresso. If you can tell when to stop the water based on the color of the coffee coming out, then a bit more or less from the grinder will affect how full the cup gets rather than the taste of your brew. You can't automate a perfect espresso, but you can use the correct tools to allow you to make one with experience 
Bought this to use with my rancilio. It seems to have made a huge difference. I thought there was something wrong with the espresso maker as my espresso was always flat and thin tasting. Freshly ground beans is the way to go - vast improvement over preground espresso (illy's or lavazza). I would have given it 4.5 stars, the only thing holdng it back is the silly doser. Either I'm not using it right, or its just not well designed, But everything else makes this a worthwhile purchase to those coffee freaks who can afford it. I used the free shipping and $25 off deal - thanks Threefires 
Its amazingly quiet considering whats happening to those poor little beans...It gives me just the grade of grind I need for my espresso machine to get a perfect shot...but it gets a 4 rather than 5 because there were no anti-skid pads on the base (I think they may have been missing...or maybe they just don't provide them even though there is a place for them.. 
I got this to accompany my Gaggia 35005 Carezza, because had been having inconsistent results with blade grinders, and store bought pre-ground wasn't doing it for me. This thing makes a *huge* difference, it's incredible. For that particular espresso machine, I found that a grind setting of 9 works great. The problems are the doser doesn't actually neatly dose anything, sometimes I have to hit it 5 times, sometimes 3... puzzling. You can eye it, but the thing only appears to work if you grind a bunch of beans, and make more than one drink. First drink, it takes a few pulls to get the grounds to the front for the doser. Also, there's no neat way to only grind what you need to use, looks like some experimentation and another timer will be required. Another issue is it looks like you have to actually disassemble it, which is not a simple task, to clean it thoroughly... or really even at all. Overall, it's quiet, creates perfect grounds, has a *ton* of settings (although, I can only see myself using two, one for coffee, one for espresso), but the doser is garbage. I might have opted for a cheaper model, knowing this... but my lattes are perfect now 
My elderly kitty had orthopedic surgery on his right knee in Feb '07 and a month later he was still in pain and walking very gingerly. Our local vet suggested Nutramax Cosequin for Cats and within four days there was an absolutely dramatic change for the better. Moses stopped growling, crying, and biting his tail. He began walking around the bedroom in which he was confined (for safety). His appetite improved and he enjoyed grooming once again. He has continued his progress and his walk is sure-footed and appears painless. He sleeps well, is as active as his surgeon allows, and we are very thankful to have found this product. My fiancee believes that Glucosamine and Chondroitin enabled him to postpone his knee surgery for nearly ten years so he was not as surprised as I about our kitty's improvement. Pain and arthritis control is so difficult in cats. Please speak to your Vet and consider trying this product. Open the capsules and sprinkle into about a tablespoonful of food and mix it in. Our little Mr. Fussy-eater likes it just fine! Then offer any other food your cat might like. Cosequin certainly reduced, and has nearly ended, any visible suffering for our precious little guy. Thanks, Nutramax. R 
The product came quickly and seems to really be helping our 15 year old cat. She'd been limping pretty badly beforehand and is walking much more easily now. The capsules are easy to sprinkle on her food and she gobbles it right down. I've just ordered a hefty supply to continue with the supplement regimen 
My Maine Coon has arthritis in his paws. His paws get quite swollen. With the Cosequin the swelling has noticeably improved and he isn't limping! He isn't running but he is walking better. 
This product worked great for our 17 year old cat. Due to his increasing arthritis, we were concerned that we were going to have to put him to sleep soon to put him out of his misery. After being on this 2.5 months, he is back to normal. He still moves slow, but he's not in pain, and you would move slow too if you were 80+ years old! We highly recommend this. 
I've used this product before. It's easy to sprinkle on catfood -- difficult to tell how effective it is but the cat gets around 
This is a great product and has really helped our 9 year old cat who weighs in at about 14 pounds. He started limping a while ago and wasn't up to playing very much. He started to put on more pounds which put us in a no-win situation. We started giving him the Cosequin and it really helped. He is now limp-free and plays a lot more. He really likes the flavor and has no problem eating it at all. I'm thrilled with the price also because our vet was charging us $45 for the same package of capsules! Thanks for a great product 
We've been using Cosequin for about a year for our 11-year-old cat. He'd been showing signs of pain that the vet said was most likely arthritis and suggested trying Cosequin. I noticed within a few weeks a vast improvment and I've been using it since. I paid much more at the vets than I did online. Recently I ran out and didn't get around to buying more for a few weeks, and my cat started having pain again. He's back on it now, and I won't let that happen again 
My cat is almost 17 years old and has developed arthritis in his knees. Prior to Cosequin he was limping any time he walked and was in obvious pain. He only limps now when he first wakes up but who doesn't getting old is a bitch. Anyway it's a great product and way cheaper through Amazon than from the vet 
This heats perfectly evenly, cooks wonderfully, looks great, and I believe you could burn glue in this pan and it would wash out with cold water and a couple of swishes with a brush. The non-stick, which is not Teflon, covers the inside AND outside of the pan, except for the very bottom that sits on the heating element, so you don't have drips burning onto the side that won't come off. And absolutely nothing sticks to this stuff--I cook almost everything without oil or fats of any kind, and I have used one of these pans hundreds of times to brown onions, sear meat, melt (and burn) cheese, and even "fry" eggs with no oil. Nothing sticks, and everything rinses right off. The lids are tempered glass, with a valve under the center handle that lets you let off the steam or keep the pot sealed. The handles are very comfortable. I think the pans and the lids look terrific, even if they aren't highly polished stainless or chrome (and how long does that high polish last?). Two caveats, both of which are in the instructions: keep the heat below High (on an electric, the element should NEVER glow red), and make sure there are no traces of food on the pan before you use it again. Little smears that you don't quite see when you've just washed the pan, but you can see when it's completely dry, can cook onto surface and reduce the effectiveness of the non-stick, and can cause discoloration. And you don't need to cook over blazing burners like they do on the TV shows--I get great results at moderate heat. Besides, I don't have a crew to clean my crusty pans when I'm finished cooking like the TV chefs do. 
In my opinion, these are the greatest pans available! Non stick without the worry. Goes into the dishwasher, no problem. I am replacing all my other pans with this brand 
I have owned countless nonstick pans, only to find that they peel after time (scary with all the teflon toxicity reports) and don't conduct the heat well. I now have a new gas stovetop with super high btu burners. The nonsick I had couldn't hold up to the heat. I purchased the Swiss Diamond 12" and 10" frypans. I am back to buy the 8". The Swiss Diamond heats evenly, has a nice flat bottom, and is very effective in the nonstick department. It just loves the high heat of my burners. And my husband loves it too(so I get dinner cooked for me!)I highly recommend the Swiss Diamond nonstic 
The Swiss Diamond Fry Pan is an outstanding fry pan. It heats very evenly and cleans up well. We bought it having used one at my neighbor's house and were impressed with the pan 
I found purchased this pan at the beginning of September when there was only one review for all of the pieces. I wanted to use as a test pan before ordering more. Let me tell you this is definitely on my Christmas list! I am thoroughly impressed. I have used this pan nearly daily sometimes twice daily since receiving it and it has performed flawlessly. Within the month my husband stacked knives, forks spoons inside it then topped it off with 6 dinner plates. I nearly had a heart attack! My son had done that to a Calphalon Commercial Nonstick fry pan I had to throw it in the trash. I quickly unloaded it, all the while chastising my husband for doing that to a nonstick. I inspected it closely, but couldn't find one nick or scratch! I was absolutely amazed! I cooked bacon one day decided to use my rectangular iron bacon press in it. I accidently scraped the sides a couple different times with no damage whatsoever. Another day I accidently left the empty pan on the burner at medium-low heat for well over 20 minutes. The burner itself started to smoke, but not the pan! No warping or darkening of the finish. I was sure then I had done it in, but again I was wrong. I must admit that I don't use metal utensils in it, although it states that you can. I always use silicone (mostly) or nylon. I also don't put it into the dishwasher as I won't have one till the kitchen gets remodeled, so have not tested it in these two aspects. I must warn others that this pan takes a few minutes to heat up fully. I heat it up on medium-high heat every time and then reduce the temperature to medium to medium-low. I flash-cooked bacon the first time I used it due to failing to reduce the temperature. Now, if they just made bakeware small appliances with this stuff on it.. 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COOKWARE I HAVE EVER USED! I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUG 
Do not believe this line - "Ergonomically designed nut cracker is ideal for cracking all sizes of nuts." This nutcracker does not work with smaller nuts, such as unopened pistachios (or, for those who love Japanese foods, the shells of of large ume plum seeds -- which are about the same size as a pistachio.) From the description, the design seemed like it should have worked. There were two problems - (1) the cone is still too wide to trap and wedge smaller nuts even at the bottom and (2) range of the lever does not reach the smaller nuts when inside the cone. Because the nuts don't wedge themselves, squeezing the handle simply moves smaller nuts inside the cone. Because the lever doesn't reach the smaller nuts, the nuts ultimately reorient themselves until they are "safe from harm's way." While I could see how this item might work for a larger nut - like a large walnut, it's not why we purchased the unit. In fairness, I wouldn't have been so harsh in my one-star review here if the manufacturer's description set the proper expectation of nut sizes or types that this unit would work for 
Great product. excellent suction. Easy to assemble. Easy to clean. Great rewind facility. Power brush was missing though 
I bought this vacuum at a local Costco after reading the reviews online. It was great--for a week until the belt broke after a dodgy incident with a throw rug that I'd rather not go into. I returned it and got another one and this one did an amazing job--for one and half months. Almost two months later the suction is poor, it spits back out dirt, and generally seems malevolent. We have two cats, one dog, one toddler, and one pregnant wife in this house and quite frankly I need more peace of mind in my household products 
Had it for a month now and it's excellent! Paid $57 and it was a steal 
Haven't had the vac long but so far it has very good suction and light weight when using. The cord rewind is a plus also 
This vacuum works great and comes at an excellent price. We use it on carpet and wood floors and it cleans pet hair really well. The hand tools are also great for getting under furniture and in tight spaces. Highly recommended 
I was looking for something to keep my mid-sized apartment cleaned, as I am a pretty big neat-freak. This was the perfect buy. The automatic cord-retractor is a great feature, although it wasn't the feature that made me choose to purchase this model, it is definitely something I'm glad it has. It's not too loud, nor too heavy. It's got a very easy to use bagless garbage collection bucket. Limits the amount of dust you put back onto your floor after cleaning it the first time. I love this product and am super happy I got it and at such a great price 
I searched around for a while for a reasonable priced vaccum. I have only 1 real rug but man was it covered in dog hair, i used to be able ot rake it off with my One Sweep, now that I have this vac there is almost none left even after a day or two of not vaccuming. I am so happy i bought this vac 
I ordered this item for a friend. He was searching everywhere for a replacement for his present one that broke but couldn't find it. I finally found this dispenser on your website and ordered it for him and he was more than satisfied. He said it was much better then the one that he was replacing 
Exactly as pictured. Looks great. Pumps work flawlessly. I put hand-soap in one and dish-soap in the other. I have used it for about a year now without problems 
This worked great for about two weeks of minimal use. I live in New York and I don't believe I got more than 5 gallons of water before the filter stopped working completely. Definately not worth the money 
I purchased a Brita after being a devout pitcher system user for years. I'd had a faucet system from Pur a few years back and it leaked. I was hesitant to go the faucet route again. I figured I'd pay extra for this most expensive Brita model, assuming mechanical integrity. Here's my overview: The installation (to the sink) was easy. The unit has not leaked at all. This is great. The filter installation is easy. The battery installation was also easy. I have owned the system for 4 months and replaced 2 filters. The Aquaview display in BJs shows a clearly worn filter needing replacement. This worn filter is shown through the Aquaview window. My own filters look as clean as the day I installed them at the point when the unit indicates yellow and red LED lights. This , by Brita's own definition, is when you replace your filter. The cost of these filters is $25 a whack. I would not mind this price if I felt the filter's proverbial time was up. I'm feeling that I'm replacing good filters. I taste test the water each day. The tap water defintely tastes worse than the Brita water. Noticeable. This gives me confidence the unit is working. The Aquaview feature is supposed to be away to say--Hey look my filter is really dirty, it's capturing the contaminants I'd drink. My town's water is dirty. If you leave sheets wet in the washer, you will get a brown tinge. Why are my filters clean in the Brita unit after two months. The LED says change the filter (RED Light). The aquaview shows me a clean filter to the naked eye. The price of use for these filters is $150 per year, with this red light going off every two months like a clock alarm. Brita is there a chance that the filter is still good, even with your LED light on? Can you let consumers in on this? I realize many contaminants may not make your filter elements dirty, but then why make something called an Aquaview filter, if the view shows a clean filter and I'm throwing away a clean filter. So fellow consumers, beware! The proof is not in the pudding. Taste alone does not insure that harmful contaminants are not reaching me---this means the system may not be working even on week one. The LED light system, at least in my household, does not correlate even slightly with the naked eye Aquaview condition. My filters look like they could go another month or two without dirtying. This may be testimony to a really good filter. The taste test does not correlate with the Red Light. The water, even with a replace indicator, and a clean view indicator, still tastes better than tap and equivalent to the filter being a day or two old. I would say my filter is still good and Brita has me over replacing good filters but we're dealing with the world of microbial contaminants---who are they to go liberal on filter conservation. On the other hand it's a big hit to consumers and environment to be throwing these units away good. So.......beware on this machine. You will probably, even with a dirty view, find yourself replacing filters sooner than the manufacturer describes. You may find yourself like me and another reviewer on this site, with LED lights going off and filters not looking dirty. I am curious about the New Jersey person who claims they have not changed it yet, seemed like about 6 months. This is disconcerting because the LED light is a timer or volume control and would go off regardless of your Aquaview filters visual condition. 6 months on a filter seems too long though and I'd conjecture you're getting some bad stuff in your tap. Brita please provide much greater detail on your website (which doesn't work tonight for registration or support email. Regards 
For all you people out there who have a hard time stopping a Brita filter system from leaking, just pop out the washer from the original aearator that you just unscrewed to install the Brita in the first place and add it on top of the Brita washer! Then just reinstall it! It's just that simple 
Now I can drink water and make Tea Coffee without the clorine tast 
I JUST RECEIVED MINE THIS AFTERNOON AND IT TOOK MY BOYFRIEND LESS THAN 5 MINUTES TO INSTALL AND WAS SO EASY THAT I COULD HAVE DONE IT. WE NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TASTE OF OUR WATER ALREADY AND ARE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. I WILL DEFINITELY DRINK MORE TAP WATER AND THROW AWAY THE PITCHER NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS FILTER. NEW YORK WATER TASTES LIKE A SWIMMING POOL AND THIS MAKES DRINKING IT SO MUCH BETTER! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRITA FILTER SYSTEM 
The Aquaview 42645 by Britta was a snap to install and it is working with no problems so far 
THE BRITA Aquaview System IS THE VERY GOOD FILTER THE WATER TASTE IS REALLY GOOD . ONLY IS TOO EXPENSIVE . OK THANK 
no way do you get up to 4 months usage as advertised on TV. customer support says up to 100 gallons of water - I doubt that from my experience. averaged 2 weeks per costly filter. the LED (green, yellow, red) really serves no meaning function as it does not seem to actually give the you the status of the filter's condition. would not purchase one again. look elsewhere for a different product and consider an under the counter system 
Attachment to the kitchen faucet is very suspect. Plastic parts do not make for a sure fit. IF YOU EVER RUN HOT WATER THROUGH THE FILTER... forget it. This has happened twice at my house. If hot water goes through the filter, even for five seconds, the filter is ruined. Two brand new filters at $24/each met this fate. When this happens the whole contraption pops off the faucet. Spend another $50-$70 bucks and install an industrial grade in line filter underneath the sink. In line filter replacements are cheaper than small Brita filters and can be found at Ace Hardware. I am EXTREMELY disapointed in the Brita AquaView product. 
This was a perfect replacement for the 10" glass lid I accidentally broke. And the seller shipped it via DHL, instead of UPS, so it was delivered to my P.O. Box with no pain or attempts to track down packages. The price may seem a bit steep, but the construction and materials are excellent - thick stainless steel and a VERY firmly attached handle. I'm considering replacing all my glass lids with stainless steel. I won't be able to see how things are cooking, but at the same time I'll never have to worry about breaking another lid 
A fair price for this dishwasher-safe, non-stick pan of this high quality. Even cooking with little or no oil. Very pleased 
After reading other reviews on this skillet I orded it. We love it. It is so nice to cook on low heat and have the meat to brown. I just heat the skillet up on med heat and put a chop in it cooks very slow and nice. I do need to use any oil or breading. I love this skillet 
If you are going to buy only one pan this is the one. It's perfect for every use as far as size and depth, and wipes clean! A little on the heavy side but that's the quality it's made of. The only thing missing is a lid, but you can use one of thoses universal size lids for all pans. For such a quality pan I would like to see a quality glass perfect fit lid. Other than that you can't find better 
Throw out the oil, PAM, and butter. This skillet is great, eggs, swedish pancakes, tacos, meeatballs, everything slides right off with no charring and a great even cook. Best of all, cleanup is a cinch, I just use a soft wet sponge and everything wipes off without any stains or residue, heck I even made some Indian curry and you know how that stains, well no problem with this skillet. The pan is quite heavy, which I like, but not too heavy to still flip pancakes and eggs with one hand 
Works great! It heats up fast and cleanup is a breeze. Haven't tried washing it in a dishwasher 
Great skillet. There non-stick holds up well. I cook with All-Clad (Stainless)usually, but for non-stick I use Anolon 
I'd been thinking about buying a blender for making smoothies, milkshakes etc. for ages but instead made do with the ordinary blenders made exclusively for the home. In short, those blenders have been utterly disappointing because they don't crush ice, feel too 'plastic-ky' and never produce good drinks. So, after reading the glowing reviews for Waring blenders, I decided to take the plunge and buy one. I bought the commercial bar blender with the stainless steel canister (I guess I was worried that the traditional glass one might crack, even if others insist that it won't). It seems expensive, but once you buy this you'll be wondering why you ever settled for anything less! It crushes ice like a dream and I can turn out superb drinks (no lumps!). It's extremely easy to use and so easy to clean. I make breakfast smoothies every day now 
My old belnder broke and it was hard to find a good one to substitute. I actually had a very simple and cheap model, but it seemed the old ones were better than the new models. The jars were seemed not to be shaped right and there was always some food left over in chunks when I wanted all to be pureed. After trying 2 other very good brands and having to return them I finally decided to try the waring. And what a great blender it is! Somewhat noisy, but I really don't mind that when the appliance gets the job done. My smoothies came out smoothier than ever, and the pureed soups were velvety creamy. Definitely a 5 stars product, and worth every penny spent on it! 
My husband and I drink friut smoothies almost daily, so I was looking for a blender that can withstand daily use. We've been through 2 previous blenders and the magic bullet, but the Waring Professional Blender is great.It gets the job done. It crushes the ice cubes and blends well in only a few seconds. I love having only 2 speeds, who needs to liquefy or puree anyway? I also like having the stainless steel container, no glass to break. So far I'm pleased with my purchase 
I've used this blender about 45 times, mostly on frozen bananas with milk or yogurt. It works. Some reviewers have had problems with splashing. The instructions say to hold the lid down. I turn the blender on with one hand and hold the lid down with my other hand. The inside of the lid does get splashed. I've never had splashes come through the lid. Once the blender is running, I let go of the lid, open the little hole, and drop frozen bananas into the hole while holding the outside lid. Tiny splashes come though the little hole, which I can't see as unusual or problematic. I'm very happy 
Pulverizes ice, but loud as a lawnmower-- Waring's best by far 
This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal. It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma. However, as is the case when function follows form, this is a horrible blender. Don't get me wrong - I'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss-poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant. But quite frankly, this blender is beyond bad. Most unfortunate is the blender's propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand. It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor. I suspect that the unit's quasi-industrial motor may be a contributing factor; it only supports two speeds: off, and jet-cyclonic. While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right, the consequences of omitting ramp-up speeds are overbearing, consistently messy, predictably inconvenient, and potentially dangerous (as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing). The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward; and the blender's poorly-sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion. In fact, this blender splashes so profusely that it's nearly unusable. It's too bad, because superficially, this blender really is quite the objet d'art. But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance, it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $29 Oster. If I had to summarize this blender as accurately, succinctly, and fairly as possible, I'd distill it down to one word - "regrettable." 
Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up 
Overall this is an excellent blender. It's well crafted and sturdy, made of metal and glass. I had a cheap Hamilton Beach in college and it just didn't cut it. I had leakage all the time with the HB blender and the 9 million speeds it had were worthless. As other reviewers here have said you only really need the Waring's low and high speeds. That's it. Seriously. This blender has only a few pieces and it works so well. I've used it many times to make frozen drinks, smoothies, milkshakes, etc. People have also complained they've had problems with ice. If you fill the blender with the liquids, soft foods, etc on the bottom and add ice cubes little by little at the top it pulverizes the mixture like no other. My girlfriend likes her drinks with little chunks of ice and I like them smooth. The Waring caters to us both. It's easy to clean if you follow the instructions. Think about this: although it's higher priced than other blenders out there, it's an investment. Do you want to keep re-buying the same kitchen appliance many times or do you want to buy it once? There's a reason why Waring decided to bring back the classic beehive design that our Grandparents used. It's because it works--if you don't believe me then look at the tight spiral that the class carafe and metal blades create with your drink. Just peer over the top of the unit while it's on. Quite a show! This blender is slick 
So far so good with this blender. My only gripe is that is doesn't seem to crush all the ice. There's always a little piece left in the bottom. I jiggle the container, turn up the speed then back down but that ice sliver won't blend. Aside from that issue, the blender is working well. 
This product should be labeled as a "Mr Heater" propane guage. It does not measure the level of liquid propane in your tank. However, it does measure the ability of the vaporized flow of propane gas to keep up with the usage of your propane appliance. The red, yellow, and green indicator disk on the circular dial makes it easy to see how your propane use is doing before you completely run out. Its debatable if you need to know "exactly" how much liquid propane is still in the tank. The vaporization indicator on this guage has been useful for me 
Expensive? Yes! Worth? Definitely! The set is amazingly good. I've tested drive the knifes against my existing knifes: there is a grand canyon of difference. PS: The knife is great, but it is not sold by Amazon, but be Macy's. They do not offer the fast delivery options when buying through Amazon, and dealing with them is a pain in the neck. Would avoid Macy's at all costs. Their service is not even close to Amazon's (the 5 stars are for the knife. Macy's get a 0 
The pieces I use the most in this set is the scissors, cook's knife, paring, bread and sharpening steel. I can do without the other ones but I like the extra slots to add to my collection and it's more expensive to collect them singly. I used to think that all knives are created equal. Since I love cooking shows and Top Chef, I always wanted to chop as fast as they do. I used to watch Fu Pei-mei Chinese cooking shows when I was a little girl and she said that you can do it by curling your fingers in so the knife touches your knuckle. I tried and tried and for fear of seing my bare white knuckles, I just couldn't do it. Then after I came here, American chefs chop differently using a rocking motion. I bought from Costco a set of Henckles International knives what I thought was high quality knives... afterall, they were a German brand Henckles. When I first got them, I always had mysterious cuts on my other fingers but I thought it must be me. Then I tried to imitate the American chefs. I tried and tried and for fear of loosing all my fingers, I just couldn't do it. I thought I must have the technique wrong. Afterall, they do it with such finesse. Well, I finally gave in at my old age b/c my expensive German knives turned out to be made in Spain and are so dull that I can barely cut through chicken thighs, even after sharpening. So I finally got myself some righteous German knives... First, I didn't feel like spending a lot for the knives so I bought the cheaper Wusthof Gourmet set for half the price. Ha... you get what you pay for... the smaller knives are so thin, I thought I could break it. I returned it and got the "creme de la creme" (ok, almost b/c there's the Shun) Wuesthof classic and the Wuesthof Santoku used by almost all the celebrity chefs on the Food Network. Now I know the secret to all those chefs who can chop so fast. It's not the technique... it's the KNIVES. 
I've been using these knives at home since I was a child. My parents received their set as a wedding gift 35 years ago. For the most part the knives are just now starting to show signs of wear (mostly from poor care). With a professional sharpening every few years and hand washing these knives will last a lifetime 
I have this exact set and have had it for probably 6 years. The knives stay super sharp and look almost new even after years of use. You get what you pay for. If you want to own a set of knives that you'll only have to purchase once, this would be it 
I am a stage performer as well as a chef. I specialize in contortion and throwing knives (often with my feet). I use the Wusthof so much in the kitchen, that I thought I would incorporate it into my act. I throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants. Throwing knives are usually smaller, perfectly balanced, and forged from one solid piece. They require perfect tang as well and incredible strength. Wusthof is the ONLY high-end kitchen knife that meets these requirements. Although I have several chef's knives (global, henckel, wusthof, etc) I prefer the Wusthof both in the Kitchen and on Stage. I would never bring the Henckel or any other brand. Wusthof has absolutely perfect balance and tang. The difference from throwing knives is that kitchen knives usually have handles added to the forged steel. Unlike any other high-end brand, Wusthof's handle is extremely durable. In practice, I broke all other brands of knife, both handle and blade. I was surprised that my Henckels did not last very long (the 6" 4-star pro's blade snapped in half and 8"'s handle came apart on one side). The quality of a Wusthof really shows when you use it for something it's not meant for and is still extremely reliable. And as you can read in all the other reviews, it is very sharp. In case you're wondering, I've never injured an assistant, but I did slit my foot open one time. I also stuck a head of lettuce to a vaulted ceiling 
Perfect little timer. Did not scare me when the alarm went off. Happy I bought it. 
I consider myself a serious aquarist with a setup that cost me over $3000 for my overly spoiled Koi and fancy goldfish. I recently moved from Pennsylvania to New York City where the water quality is not nearly as friendly toward goldfish nor consistent coming out of the tap and so I find myself testing the water many times in between scheduled water changes from the tank as well as the faucet. I can't stress enough how convenient it is to dip one of these strips and be done with all the testing in one shot, but also consider that the liquid tests are not much more economical. Each strip costs around $0.20, and with 5 tests all done within about a minute. Even if you are doing the regular liquid 'drop-tests' for Ph, Nitrate, and Nitrite, those tests typically run at best $0.15 ($0.05 per test), and you're looking at a few minutes for each individually. I personally got tired of rinsing the tubes and leaving them somewhere to dry. But, I would also gladly spend a penny per minute to not have to go through all that 
The Pop N Cork pushes out the cork with a little wiggle. I was a little reluctant to use it at first - intimidated by pushing the hypodermic-like needle into the cork, but I now use it regularly. It makes such a happy sound when the cork pops out. It is certainly more expensive than mechanical openers and it does need replacement cartridges but it's "wow" value is high and the dang thing just flat out works. Keep it FAR from children. 
I love this thing. It is fast, easy, efficient, and a blast to use. It is surprising how easy it is, and you can impress people since very few have ever seen anything like it. Press the needle through the cork all the way in, press the end to release the gas, and the cork pops out immediately sounding like a champagne bottle. It really is quite the thing 
These are great! They look great and are heavy enough to feel sturdy yet functional. Even after wash after wash by hand and in the dishwasher, they continue to work well and maintain their shine 
I found this set of flatware to be to light weight for my taste. Would be ok for a beach cabin or camping set 
I've been a devoted cook for the past thirty years and I can truthfully say that this is the best nonstick skillet that I've ever used. It has a nice heft without being unduly heavy and has very even heat. Best of all, cleanup couldn't be easier. This is the first Swiss Diamond product that I've tried - and I look forward to purchasing more 
Wow, what a pan. I have bought the 8, 10, 11, and 12.5 inch pans. I love them. I have recently and replaced my Ultrex non stick with these pans. Waiting for the lids to the 11 and 12.5 inch ones so I can really start cooking! I have heard so much about these pans and it is ALL true. Superb cooking!! Omelets to die for they practically flip themwelves right out. Don't let the light weight of this sturdy pan fool you, it's all about performance. Heats up evenly and doesn't need very high heat at all. I was almost tempted to just paper towel the pan, but went ahead and hand washed with warm soapy water. LOVE IT!!! AWESOME 2/3/07 I recieved the 12 1/2", it comes with a lid!! I used it to make panfry dumplings. I have tried Ultrex, non stick and Revere stainless, neither with good results. Both didn't come close to Swiss Diamond. Little pricey, but I will never have to buy another non stick pan again, this one has a limited lifetime warranty. Limited to the fact I don't cook commercially or abuse the pan. Even heating, even on burner that is not as large as pan,great browning and nothing sticks. Highly recommend! 
We've gone through a lot of non-stick pans in the last few years, tried following all the instructions etc., but they all end up with little pockmarks on the surface where the non-stick became unstuck and probably ended up stuck in our livers for all I know. This Swiss Diamond pan seems to be genuinely non-stick; you can even fry cheese in it and it will slide around on the surface. It heats very evenly, and doesn't have to be treated with kid gloves, you can use metal utensils. If they weren't so expensive, I'd replace all our cookware with this. The only caveat is we've only had the thing for a month, so I can't verify the surface will stay on, but it sure looks robust. 
I love this product. I bought 3 pieces about a month ago and it easily lives up to all its claims. It looks good, cleans very easily, both inside and out. The heat dispersion/distribution is incredible. Crack an egg onto the pan and you can see how perfectly uniform it cooks immediately. Ideal for omellettes. The handles really do stay cool. The bottom is perfectly flat and works well both with gas and ceramic electric. Meat browns well. Seems to do fine in the dishwasher, although the manufacturer recommends against it. In my house, pans either survive the dishwasher or die. But frankly, it cleans so easily that the dishwasher isn't necessary. I've owned cast iron, Calphalon, Calphalon non-stick, Le Crueset non-stick, Scan Pan, and a couple of others over the years and nothing compares to this product. No scratches or flakes. Haven't tried it in the oven yet, but can't imagine why it wouldn't work perfectly. My only doubt is how long it will last. (all the other above mentioned cookware worked fine at first too) I scratched up too many non-sticks over the years. This doesn't really have a coating so that shouldn't be a problem. So far, it's been worth every penney and I will probably buy more 
You will not find a better pan than Swiss Diamond. We've had this for a few months and it still performs as brand new. I've never had a single thing stick on this. Cooking eggs, etc everything just runs out. Also, have used metal utensils on this and there are no marks. People don't believe me when I tell them about these pans. They claim they have good non stick pans... I thought we did too. You don't know non-stick until you use this pan 
I have an entire set of Swiss Diamond in addition to this pan. I bought Swiss Diamond because, due to weak wrists, I needed sturdy cookware that was not as heavy as stainless steel. Because aluminum is the primary, affordable, lighter-weight alternative, and one does not want food coming in contact with aluminum because of the possible leaching of it into the food, I sought non-stick pans with a coating that would not flake or scratch off and end up in my food. After much research, I discovered Swiss Diamond. I have not been disappointed. The pans are a great weight--hefty without being too heavy, and after several months of use, the coating is holding up beautifully. I confess that I do not primarily use metal utensils in it, however, so I can't testify about how they hold up against metal. These pans caramelize food beautifully, and the evenness of the heat distribution in them is a pure joy. They do take a few extra seconds to heat up, but hold heat very well. I really love how flat the pan's bottom is, and imagine if you have a flush electric cooktop, these would be especially appreciated. Though I have a gas range, I had trouble in the past with pots and pans slipping and sliding on the enameled grates, but these pans do not slide. And I was delighted to discover, after realizing I had accidentally left this pan on low heat for an hour with no food in it, it did not warp at all and is still in perfect condition. This cookware cleans up easily and perfectly, too. I love that they are coated on the outside walls of the pans so any dried or cooked on food comes off the outside as easily as the inside. One thing to note is that if you are looking for a pan to cook eggs in without oil, this may not be your best choice. The texture of the diamond coating seems to grab more than a slick Teflon pan would, and the first time I tried to flip my fried eggs without a spatula, I had less than stellar results. But with sufficient oil, I can flip the eggs without a spatula or a problem (I need to make my daily quota of coconut oil anyway for health reasons, so I'm fine with putting oil in the pan). If you use a spatula, you should easily be able to flip eggs without oil. I do hope these pans turn out to be durable over the years. So far, after a few months, they are aces! In fact, my husband may be growing weary of my exclaiming, "I LOVE this cookware!" over and over again. 
i have 2 of these things bought from the container store. they suck. like the other reviewer, both of them are sticking in a down position after only a few months of use. i got fed up with pushing the pump down and then pulling it up and ended up tearing the thing apart to see if i could fix it. turns out there are filtering screens inside the pump which get blocked by just using it. it looked like a coating of slime on the inside, which is something you might expect to happen in a product that stays wet and has a filtering screen. there is no way to clean the filters because the slime gets trapped inbetween the two filters 
This is the exact replacement air filter (and bracket) for the older Dust Buster models (check listing to make sure your model is listed). If your Dust Buster is slow, loses it's charge quickly and doesn't seem to work right, it might be that the filter is clogged, like mine was. This seems to have fixed the problem 
The filter makes me happy because it keeps my office from becoming dusty. Since this is the only filter you can buy for this product, it doesn't make sense for me to try to promote it or compare it, as you have no choice. However, compared to other similar kinds of products, this seems to do very well. No dust flying out the side of the unit, easy cleanup, easy installation and removal. Just twist it into place, and voila.

We take our frozen concoction maker with us on numerous trips and this makes that much easier 
Wow, what can I say about the Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker Bag. This was the best purchase ever made,it makes my party life a whole lot eaiser. With its padded sides and easy zippers it makes it a whole lot easier to manage when I've had a few to many. If you are lucky enough to own a Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker I stongly recomend purchasing this item for to reasons,one it protects one your greatest investments and two, it just looks so cool when you walk in to your next margarita party 
We've had our Margaritaville margarita maker for several months and have been hauling it around to friend's and family's homes for get togethers. I was always afraid that the pitcher would drop and break. So, when I saw this handy carrying case, I thought I had to get one. The case is very nicely made. I'm very impressed! The whole case is padded and there is a thick foam pad at the bottom of the case, that the machine fits snuggly into, then there are velcro straps that wrap around the machine to keep it securely in place. The sides of the case zippers to open and close the case. There are 2 heavey nylon handles for easy carrying. There is also a outside large pocket the velcros closed, perfect for carrying a salt tray. If you want to protect your $300 investment, I recommend having this 1 accessory 
I bought this ottoman and I was very disappointed with the quality of this product. One caster was already broken when it is arrived. The casters did not match the correspondent wholes in the ottoman. These wholes were framed by plastic, so this plastic did not work at all. So to make it work somehow I bought new casters. Also it is not beautiful ottoman, everything made inaccurate, the leather on the lid consist from different pieces without any order. I tried to use the ottoman as a foot rest. I'm using it during just few days, but already at the lid I can see the permanent place from my legs. So my advice, don't buy this product. It is a waste of money 
This is the strangest foot stool I have ever seen. It looks like something out of Alice In Wonderland. My toy poodle loves it. The stool is very small and looks very odd in a large room. It does not match any of my chairs in terms of size. My toy poodle fits perfectly inside the compartment. It may fit a few small magazines but nothing more. It is in the shape of a hat box. Not at all what I expected 
I do A LOT of baking and I have used my fair share of spatulas. I can honestly say this spatula brand (I purchased the same brand spatula in another size) is the BEST I have every owned. It is flexible enough at the tip to clear away batter from the sides of the bowl, but firm enough through the body so that it remains flat against the bowl. The best characteristic is its single construct form which means that no mold/bacteria grow between the spatula head and the "stick" that usually goes inside and the entire spatula can be used at very high temps. The entire body of this spatula is silicone, therefore, clean-up is easy: Just place in the dishwasher and you have a sterilized and fantastic spatula to use again and again. I just wish I didn't waste all that money/drawer space on other spatulas. (i.e. those spatulas that have a silicone head, but a wooden body . . . these just grow stuff inside the "hole" in the silicone head!) My advice: Don't look any further for a spatula that will fit ALL of your baking needs 
if you have a dishwasher this is the perfect dish drainer for you to have for ther every now and then when something is not dishwasher safe you still have a dish drainer but you are not using your counter space for it i love this item 
These aren't the thickest towels I've owned and they're definitely not Grand Patricians, but for the price, they are a nice 'guest bath' towel. They have held up well to washing and I've had no problems with colorfastness. They are a mid-line towel at a Walmart price 
I bought these washcloths to fill in a set of towels I bought on Amazon the same day. The set I purchased came with two washcloths, and I always like to have four, so I can rotate them to keep them fresh. These washcloths are fabulous. Very soft, yet absorbant and large. Often washcloths are only 12 x 12, even expensive ones, but these are 13 x 13, and have retained their shape and color through several washings. I am very pleased with them 
This is the second or third time I have purchased linens on line from Amazon. When I receive the merchandise it is always as expected. Although I have to pay shipping, for me it is a convenience expense. I live an hour away from a shopping center, have an intense work schedule allowing little time for shopping in a conventional way. This is a terrific way for me to buy what I want, get the quality I expect, and make the best use of my time 
I purchased a 4 towels, 4 washcloths and 2 handtowels as a gift for my brother. After the towels, etc. were washed several times they still left lint on him and the wall the towel rack was on. Needless to say, he gave me my gift back. Now I'm stuck with the towels. If I could return them, I would. This item should not receive even 1 star but since 1 is the lowest, that will have to do 
Very poor quality! The material is very thin and even after multiple washing, the fabric continues to "bleed" every time it's used 
I just ordered two of these cloths on July 21, 2006, thought I was getting 2 2-packs of the wash cloths, when the package arrived it contained just 2 single wash cloths. Before purchasing these cloths, I called Amazon and the representative assured me that what I would be ordering is a 2-pack, she said "Look at the picture, it appears to be 2 cloths and several of the reviews refer to 2-packs, don't worry, you will get 2 cloths in the pack." When the cloths arrived, there were 2 individually wrapped cloths and that completed my order. I immediately called Amazon and the very helpful representative agreed that the product description was vague and she agreed to credit my account for 1 of the wash cloths. She also said she was putting in a request that description be changed to make it clear that you would receive only 1 wash cloth. Hope this helps anyone else confused about this 
I loved this grinder when we first got it because we use a french press, an automatic coffee pot, and an espresso maker. The array of grinds is wonderful! If it only lasted.... I had the same problem as everyone else, the ring broke I found myself shoving paper in just to get a seal. Would be a superior product if they made it to last 
I purchased this grinder and was very pleased with its performance. I really like its compact size, the ability to choose grind and to just press the button so I could fill my coffee maker with water while it ground. I also like that the cord winds into itself and it stores easily. However, after about six months of daily use, the plastic which holds the metal cup and blades to the body broke, rendering the grinder useless. I was very disappointed. I don't know if it's a design flaw or just a fluke with mine, but I probably won't purchase it again 
This product is great. I was so tired of using other types of can openers, and I've tried them all. With the electric ones the cans would slip off and splash water all over the table. The manual ones also slip off and then I'd have to saw the rest of the lid off with a steak knife. Both types leave a very sharp lid. I've cut my fingers many times. The OneTouch solves all the problems associated with opening cans. You just place the One Touch on top of the can press the button and the One Touch does the rest. This can opener even leaves a lip on the top of the lid so you can close the can. Fantastic ! 
I have this dispenser in an area where it only gets used once a day. It takes 3 activations even at the max setting to get enough soap to wash your hands. If you let it sit without using it for a couple days, it takes 1-2 activations before any soap at all comes out. Performance degrades further as amount of soap in dispenser decreases. Soap in it is Dial antibacterial. A mechanical dispenser would work better than this 
This AAA battery powered device works just like the fancy ones you'll find in upscale public bathrooms. The dial/off-on switch works well. Assembly is a little confusing. Apparently you need to prime it, but I wasn't able to figure out this part without the fear of breaking it. So I just filled it with soap and it worked fine. That's my only problem with it. It would be nice if they provided a sticker with brief instructions for guests. Wash your hands often--especially when you're about to handle food 
very nice, warm blanket, but too big for a full size bed, way too big 
I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now. The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review. The real issue is that the quality is very poor. I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better. Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way. 
I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
Don't hesitate to buy this light weight blanket. It is wonderfully made; the reason I'm giving it a 5 rating is that it fits my California King bed. I've looked high and low to find a blanket that fits....this one does! Buy this blanket with confidence. Deffinately a great find on Amazon, and the price wasn't bad either 
We inherited a collection of vintage Franciscan Apple that have decorated our china hutch for almost 20 years. Recently I searched for an everyday dinnerware for my family of 5. After weeks of searching, I chose the "still available after 65 years" Apple pattern. In addition to the microwave, dishwasher safe, freezer safe attributes, I love the fact that these dishes are NORMAL size. My service for 12 actually fits in the cabinet and in the dishwasher. The dishes are smaller and lighter weight than most patterns available today. Hurray! Who needs a coffee cup that is so large you can't drink it before it gets cold or a cereal bowl that looks like a mixing bowl. The lighter weight is easier for children to handle so we have few accidents. And, I love the variety of open stock accessories still available. After 20 years, we still love MeMa's old Apple Dishes... 
When I was a young woman, my next door neighbors were a large family. The mother, an artist, was very beautiful, gracious, and gentle. I was often invited to share the family meals that were served on this Franciscan Apple Dinnerware. When it came time for me to purchase my everyday china, I had no hesitation in choosing this nostalgic pattern. I have a service for 16 now, with all the extra pieces. You can wash all of the Franciscanware in the dishwasher, but be sure to not use too much detergent. Highly Recommended for those who like handpainted china and Apples 
First saw these in Italy and fell in love! These baskets help keep fingers and butter knives out of the toaster by simply lifting up the basket for shorter breads like Italian or french toast, mini bagels, etc. Would highly recommend these to anyone who toasts! I bought a set for my parents 
The Duallit sandwich cage barely holds one half-inch piece of bread, let alone two for a sandwich. It rips the bread and makes a mess of the toasters slot. I through away twenty bucks on this apparatus 
I don't have a Dualit toaster, but I do have a single wide slot Cusinart toaster so I thought I'd take a chance on this item. It It works really well and I don't have a problem with regular bread getting squished like the other reviewer mentioned. Take care when removing your sandwich as its easy to forget that the metal is quite hot when taken from the toaster 
So, the espresso machine is great. It's solidly built and has a very simple design to it. I recommend this machine to anyone who wants to make espresso at home and would like their machine to last more than a couple years. It's moderately priced--and by moderate I mean kind of high for a home system, but definitely not 12 thousand dollars--and it's also pretty cool looking. Which is always a bonus. Issues that I've had are few in number, but I'll give some hints in getting your new machine to work to your liking--and by your liking I mean my liking. First, make sure the thing stays clean. This is especially important when it comes to steaming milk. The Wand needs to be cleaned quickly, thoroughly, and often. Try to clean the machine every 2-3 weeks (heavy use) and 4-6 weeks (light use) with espresso machine cleaner. This will make steaming milk much easier and faster, since you've removed the obstacles to the steam. Second, making espresso takes some tinkering. Usually, espresso at a coffee shop is run at around 140 degrees (C). On the machine, espresso is set to run at around 80-100 degrees C, while steaming milk is set for 140 degrees. Simply set the machine to steam milk, load your shot, steam your milk, and run your shot at 140 degrees. Start counting when the espresso starts dropping to about 17-22 seconds. If you're not content with the rate or quantity, adjust the espresso grind--to more coarse or fine--to increase or decrease the rate of the shot. Third, this is all aesthetic, but I find I get the best espresso from a Vienna or French Roast coffee. Personally, I love Sumatran Coffee, but Costa Rica, Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, and Kona (Hawai'i) are close seconds. Buy Fair Trade and Organic Coffee. And then enjoy some wicked good espresso. Happy Coffee Drinking! -- 
If you like the styling -- buy it! hey, it comes in COLORS! But, if you want performance and reliability - AVOID any Francis unit. They are made poorly, and of light materials. Dave -- professional espresso repairman 
We bought this beautiful machine after many other "cheaper ones". But within 6 months, the wand started leaking (have to leave a towel to soak up the excess water when not steaming). The temp. gauge never read the correct temp. so I emailed CS and was informed that the gauge is for asthetic use only---and not accurate. (It's for novelty use only). A few weeks later, the temp. gauge stopped working completely. 2 years later; the seams are rusting....and when you release the steam valve now, there is no steam pushed out (no pressure to heat the milk).... We clean and maintain it 2x a month....but do make ALOT of espresso (3-4 day). CS says to mail it to them to repair for a cost. I am REALLY disappointed it didn't last even 2 years 
I'm Italian (born and raised there) and I grew up on cappuccinos. This is in absolute the most gorgeous way to make a terrible cappuccino. I have constant better result with the cheapest model made by Krupps. Pros: Beautiful to look at Espresso is good Cons: - It takes 15'-30' (minutes, not second!, and this is according to the manufacturer) to warm the machine up - The cappuccino is always watery - You need a stop watch to time exactly how much water you want in your espresso. You get distracted, and suddenly your espresso looks like any 'American' style coffe 
Good points: 1) Heats up to the right temperature relatively quickly. 2) Makes a great, strong cup of espresso with great crema (I have been using the Lavazza Gran Crema E.S.E. pods, never tried with ground espresso, because I am trying to avoid a mess). 3) Mine takes about 20 seconds to go from "espresso" temperature to the hotter "frothing" temperature, as opposed to the one or two minutes other machines take 4) It really does froth a nice thick froth, nothing runny and flimsy like every other cappucino maker I have ever had! 5) You can pretty much brew one shot after another, with a few short seconds in betweeen to allow boiler to heat up the water to the right temp. The consistency of brewing temperature is really very satisfactory and stable. 6) You can make hot chocolates and tea with the frother and hot water coming from the frother, respectively. Nice for a couple drinks at a time and a lot quicker than boiling a kettle for tea. 7) Obviously, it is a beautiful piece and you will definitely notice it gets commented about. Looks good in a modern kitchen but is also just as comfortable (in Stainless, pastel pink, cream or white) in a Shabby, retro, or country romantic kitchen. 8) The clean up is a total breeze if you are using E.S.E. pods Not-so-good points: 1) The water resevoir will need to be refilled if you make "longer" or "taller" drinks like lattes and "americanos", especially if you are making drinks for two or more in a household. If you prefer straight espresso shots and those topped off with a nice scoop or two of frothed milk, you're in business and can go for three days or more without re-filling. Otherwise, be prepared to refill daily. 2) The "cup warmer" on top of the machine is not really hot enough to keep the cups warm unless you turn the machine on for a good 20 or 30 minutes before brewing with the cups on top. But it is a cute place to store the cups and I never really had problem drinking espresso from a room temp. cup anyway, have you? Just a small thing I noticed, really but something I thought could be pointed out. Just to note: I bought mine off Ebay from the outlet refurbished and have had no problems. It came with a 6 mos. warranty, and I saved hundreds. If you cannot come up with 800 bucks for one, this is the way to go. Happy brewing and lattes of love 
Having worn out a Capresso machine after daily brewing 4-6 shots of espresso in making lattes/cappuccinos, etc. I went looking for a more durable machine. I bought an X1 in 2001/2 when it was a brand new model (in stainless) and it is great: 1. It heats up quickly. 2. It brews VERY consistently. 3. The ESE thing is the best mess-preventer ever. 4. Separate steam-temperature setting is great. Heats milk much faster than other, cheaper consumer models. 5. Machine has capacity to steam enough milk for at least 3 tall lattes before needing a quick "refill" of water from the pump switch. 6. I like the simplicity and total manual operation. The switches aren't labeled, but there's only 3. Kind of a morning meditation for me. The most important, non-obvious things: 1. Don't leave a pod in the holder and move temperature to steam setting. When you unhook the pod holder, steam will instantly blow apart the ESE pod, which, given that it is more than boiling hot, will hurt, plus will dry instantly on the wall. 2. Use INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ESE pods, unless you use them all within 2-3 hours of opening the tin. They sour very quickly, even in the freezer. I am partial to Starbucks pods, given my household's addiction to that brand, but I think that is more of a preference than a quality issue. Illy tastes fine, but you have to use them all quickly. 3. If you serve a lot of guests, the double unit (X3?) might be better. With the dual-temperature settings, you'll spend a lot of time running water through the unit to cool the steam setting back down to brew the next batch of espresso. Lots of refills of the water container, which is a bit of a pain to remove from the back of the machine. Overall, a great performer after 4 years of daily, multiple use. This thing is a great machine 
Two months ago I bought the X1 from the new serie "X1 by appointment" at the online store azone.ch. Discount price about 500 USD including a box of 18 E.S.E pods from AMICI. The inventor of the machine Francesco Illy is a "pope" of the coffee industry. He founded the "Francis Francis" Company in Switzerland. His father and grandfather are the founder of the "ILLY" coffee brand. A name for sophisticated taste of coffee. Francesco Illy started to launch his own brand "AMICI". There are actually 4 different E.S.E. pods available. My favourites are the "Espresso" (silver box with red stripe) and "Ristretto" (..with black stripe). Please check amici.ch for more information. So, that's a little bit about history and now my review: When I read the negative postings I wonder why there are some problems when using the machine or why the coffee gives some people only average joy. Here my suggestions for a real espresso experience: Rule 1: Strictly use the E.S.E. pods....the one from AMICI or LAVAZZA I can suggest. Not try to use non-E.S.E. pods. They will not fit perfectly. Rule 2: Buy some high quality espresso cups. If the porcelain is robust and thick it can keep and lead the warmth much better. Rule 3: Always use pre-heatened cup. Place them on top of the coffee machine. I never turn off the machine. If you switched of the machine, wait about 20 minutes before preparing coffee. And important: Pour one espresso cup of water before inserting any pod. This guarantees, that the cup gets his temperature and that the machine gets its operation temperature. Rule 4: Keep your machine clean. After every use clean the pad-holder. Put it in the machine (be sure there are no pods inside) and simply pour water for about 10 seconds trough it. Rule 5: For the ones who experienced damages, I think, they didn't threat it correctly! After using the steam YOU MUST SWITCH BACK to the espresso mode and activate the toggle switch for espresso. Simply pour water about 20 seconds. Now the boiler will not overheat and protects the machine. If you do not follow that rule your machine could be damaged seriously! Final commentary: Those people who wants to compare the X1 with any one from Braun for about 99 USD and think the taste is the same, I must only say, that they have no concept of good coffee taste. The Francis Francis is nothing for people who confuse real espresso flavor with the over-sweeted plastic or paper taste of any Mc Donalds or Dunkin' Donuts sewage. The first time I have seen the X1 I knew, soon or less I will purchase it. The unmistakable design didn't relinquish myself anymore. Every day walking to the kitchen, the Francis Francis X1 smiles at me. A machine to take into one's heart. Marcel Dubach, ZURIC 
For the last 5 years I have been making 3 to 4 espressos a day with it. I never had a problem! It works great, it's expensive but it's beautiful and worth the price. I recommend Lavazza espresso pods, they make an excellent crema (the yellow foam) and no mess. Starbucks pods taste strong and slightly burn, Lavazza tastes like coffee made in an italian coffee shop or a little bistro in Paris. If you can afford it, go for it! - also check out their cups (FrancisFrancis), they are beautiful, original and perfect for espressos 
Received this heater in the mail a few days after ordering. Looks like a good quality heater. It's easy to adjust and read. I've had it for a month now and it keeps my 10 gallon planted tank at a steady temp. 
I purchased a 25 watt Visi-Therm aquarium heater this week for my 5.5 gallon freshwater tropical aquarium...so far so good. The temperature has maintained where I set it for several days with virtually no fluctuation. The temp scale is printed large and easy to read. The temp adjustment knob at the top is tapered and somewhat tricky to click-turn if you can't get a good grip on it. But once set there's little need to make further adjustments. There's a red LED light that comes on when the unit is heating / the light goes off when the heater cycles off. The bracket has 2 suction cups and securely holds the heater upright and straight. This brand of aquarium heater came highly recommended by others who wrote online reviews. Amazon and most pet store websites don't carry the 25 watt model, so I bought it on an auction website, total cost $25 included shipping 
For years I have been sharpening the knives in our household. I have used wet stones, diamond sticks, ceramic sticks and many other methods in fact I have a draw full of different sharpening devices. But nothing has put an edge on knives like the Chef's Choice M130 Professional Knife-Sharpening Station. You must read the directions before you start to us the M130 or you can ruin your knives 
This item was rated tops by Cooks Illustrated. My 10 year old Henckel Knives are now the way there were the first day I bought them and the edges hold use after use. They are razor sharp. I love the result 
I cook all the dinners here at home, and sharp knives are an asset in the kitchen. A word of warning from the manufacturer is very true: "WARNING Knives sharpened on the Chef's Choice will be sharper than you expect. Use them with great care." I taped their warning to our knife rack as a reminder. In short, the manufacturer's instructions are very easy to follow, and the knife sharpener is very easy to use as well. It's a little pricey, but if you want really sharp knives you won't be disappointed. You can sharpen all your kitchen knives, serrated knives, and pocket knives, too. My knives are sharper than when I bought them. Good Luck 
We bought this particular sharpener because it was rated the best electric knife sharpener by Cook's Illustrated magazine. We are extremely happy with the product and what it has done for our knives 
The knives we got for our wedding 7 years ago had become dangerously dull.... no more! I had been wary of ruining our expensive knives with a do-it yourself sharpener, but after reading the Cooks Illustrated review of this sharpener, I was convinced. It's great, and my knives are once again nice and sharp 
BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU EVER PLAN ON USING A KNIFE. I have a decent set of Henckels that I bought about 4 years ago. I've had them professionally sharpened twice since I bought them and was never really satisfied with the edge that they came back with. I bought the M130 and have used it once and what a difference! My knives have never been sharper! I find myself wanting to prepare meals more often just so I get to use my killer "new" knives. I also used this sharpener on some other utility knives, pocket knives, carving knives, etc. If I could sharpen it I did it with the M130 and have never been happier! 
I have a 15 year old model #110 which wasn't delivering any more. I bought the 130 and it is vastly superior. This is the top of the line 
Works great on most knifes. If you have cheap knives, you can not get a good bevel edge on the blade. Would recommend to anyone 
I have tried a number of different knife sharpeners over the years and have always been unhappy with the results. Even if I carefully followed the instructions on how to sharpen a knife they never seemed to be any where near as sharp as when they were new. I read a report on knife sharpeners in Cooks and the M130 was the highest rated and the most expensive as I recall. We decided to order the machine and it really works. The knives are actually as sharp as they were when purchased. You could probably open a business sharpening knives with this machine and it would pay for itself. You could also impress your friends and family by sharpening their knives. I recommend this machine 
I previously owned the M120 from Chef's Choice and was generally pleased with the results, but found you had to really follow the instructions and run multiple passes to achieve success. I also found the results inconsistent between knife and blade styles. Based on previous reports of this sharpener, I decided to upgrade. Bottom line: Simpler, faster, and better results. You can have hair shaving results in as little as six strokes from start to finish. Highly recommended if you are serious about sharp knives 
Very nice scale, well designed, good price. It has what you need- tare and both whieght systems, mine's very accurate, and it's a good size- easy to stash but big enough to put things on. I'm very pleased, recommend it as The Deal 
I love having a scale in my kitchen and this one is nice and small, so it doesn't take up a lot of space. No more guessing, fantastic! My only complaint is that it measures in lbs and ounces (so you need to do some math if you need say 1/4 pound, which is 4 oz if my math is right) 
Its a great scale that measures accurately and very quick, it's pretty cheap and weighs up to 11 pounds. It also has the tare button to zero it out which is one of the most useful things ever. My only complain (other than that it uses a 9-volt battery) is that it really isn't very washable and you can't remove the top to wash it off from stuff that may get on it. Nonetheless it is an excellent product 
What can I say? It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well. 9V battery is easy enough to change. It does standard and metric and it is accurate. Not much else to say except you will be happy with this scale 
This scale is beautiful, low profile, easy to use and easy to clean. Its everything I needed for a good price 
I love my new scale. I can put a bowl on it and tare back to zero. Add my ingredient and tare back to zero and continue adding and taring without ever removing my bowl. Since I received my scale I have found everything, so far, easier to weigh. It takes so little room on my counter and it looks so nice and sleek sitting there plus it cleans up beautifully with just a damp cloth. I would recommend this scale to everyone 
I purchased 2 sets of these glasses in December 2006. They look great, have a nice heavy feel to them, are of obvious good quality. I could not be happier, and I'm now going to order the larger 13.5 oz. size too. If you have any doubts, you can forget them now, and buy these classy glasses. If you like the look of this style, you will not regret this purchase 
I purchased this item in December 2005 but didn't use it until July 2006. The wires broke on my first use. I thought about requesting a replacement from KitchenAid but have decided instead to ask for a refund. This item is a total waste of time and money 
purchased this item from amazon, took out of package and before even using it but touched to feel the tension on the wires and the wires broke. Got a replacement from kitchenaid (very good service) used it once for eggs, went to wipe with a damp cloth and the wire broke again. would not recommend purchasing this item 
the ice crusher is a bit noisy, and I was a little dismayed that you had to put in one cube at a time, but overall I am pleased. it does a good, quick job without any mess 
The Deni 6000 works good for only a few weeks before it fails dangerously. I have 2 units that did the exact same thing. One of the rotating blades breaks off and comes out with the ice. Fortunately for me I noticed it in my glass before eating it. Two units-identical failures. This machine is a potential safety hazzard. I will be contacting Deni about their defective design. If you use this ice crusher and it starts sounding louder than usual, one of your blades is probably bent and about to break off. Beware 
It does a pretty good job on crushing the ice, tends to "bounce around" on the counter while performing the job 
I like soft ice in my drinks. Yes it is noisy and messy but it gives me the ice I want in less than a couple of minutes and beats the heck out of buying sonic ice. It reminds me of snow cone ice 
It is great for every refreshing drinks, i use it to make "halo-halo" (mix), mixture of sweetened beans,young coconut,flan,jackfruit etc. sweets, put them in a nice big glass then add crushed ice on top and milk mixed them all together....yummy!!!!! the only thing that i find that can slow you down if you put too much pieces of big ice it will get stock so few piesec at a time.......... 
I use crushed ice when I have medical problems. I have'nt had any since I purchased the unit. Therefore I have nothing to report. 
I purchased this Ice Crusher to make some great Icy drinks, the unit works perfectly and the crushed ice blends much better that trying to use whole ice cube 
I purchased the Deni 6000 without reading the reviews. What a dummy! It is too noisy. You have to hold it down or it will vibrate off the counter. It gives you shaved ice not chunks or lumps. I guess I purchased it because it was the right price. I now own the Waring professional ice crusher 
This pan work very well. Nothing sticks to it and it is very easy to clean 
I am really happy with the purchase. First of all, it was for a great price... the product is great.... no oil is necessary, cleaning is really easy... great to make frittata coz goes straight to the oven from the stove... i love this product... its beautifu 
I use this always except for meat. I got the silicone ones with pictures on it to stop cross contamination. Buy this 
Initially purchased this item due to the easy cleaning feature, however have been very disappointed with the performance since I purchased it only 3 months ago. Edges of the lids are extrememly jagged and scraps of metal label often land in the food! And now after 3 months, the motor is worn out and the unit buzzes whenever I attempt to use it. The cutting tool won't even pierce the can without some forcefull manipulations. Bottom line, don't waste your money. 
came fast! easy to put together. the knob is not tight no matter how hard i try to screw it in. that is my only complaint 
This bowls are excellent for storage.. the lids dont come off, and they are sooo easy to put on and get off.. unlike some other items. They clean up so much easier than other plastic types. I have 2 sets of these, there an excellent buy 
I love these bowls and the price is fantastic. They will have many uses - the colors are very nice - the lids fit nice and tight and are quite sturdy. A must have for anyone who has the Sango Nova set 
I was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight. It looked to be WalMart type quality. I would have been better off buying from Linens and Things 
Columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time I didn't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom. The color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender, they call it Plumberry. The weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well, that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it. When the washcloths are completely drenched, they do seem a little more heavy than most, although they have that "spa feel" to them and they retain heat very well, which makes them sort of comforting. I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel. The edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don't fall apart the first time you wash them. ~The Rebecca Review 
I have a family of 5 and we use our fryer almost weekly. Works great for bacon to keep your stove top cleaner and anything else you want to cook 
My mother gave me this lodge fryer (she has had for many years) and I have been happy with it for more than five years now. Incredible for making stew in, this fryer has been used for almost everything except frying chicken. Every Lodge product our family has had has lasted for as long as I can remember (I am 29 now) and requires little maintanence - a little seasoning w/ oil and heat every once in a while is all. Cooking in this fashion imparts a wonderful flavor to meats, tomatoes, breads - whatever! Forget the non-stick, $400+ cooking sets from the big boys, cast iron handles cleans very well if well-seasoned and is actually best if you don't clean it too hard. And, Lodge is made here in America, in Tennessee! Who knows where that other stuff is made? As I get older, Lodge will definitely continue to be part of my cookware collection - make them part of yours if you haven't already 
I like cooking bacon in this because my stove stays a lot cleaner than using my regular depth Lodge skillets 
I have a growing number of cast iron pans from Lodge and this is one of my most used and favorite pieces. I use it for sauces, casseroles, home fries and just about anything that requires a pan larger than a fry pan. But size is just one of the plusses of this pan. Like all cast iron pans, the more you use it, the better it gets. Mine is virtually non-stick from all the use it has gotten and save for the first time I took it out of the box, it has never been washed with soap. A simple brushing,a complete drying and a thin application of shortening is all you need to keep this pan clean and rust-free. If you haven't tried cast iron before, I would encourage you to try this pan as it can be used as a skillet, fry pan and shallow Dutch oven. I am certain that if you follow the directions for seasoning and cleaning, you will be rewarded with a utensil that will last a lifetime 
This pan is slightly bigger than the Lodge Combo cooker pan. The lid arches up, allowing more volume, but then you can't use the lid as a griddle. Lodge fry pans are all great, this one too, but if you are in the market for a 10inch pan consider the Combo cooker vs this one 
This is one of the best all around pieces of cookware everyone should have if they cook. Makes a great wedding gift. I keep this on my back burner all the time (therefore it gets used). I bake cornbread, pineapple upside down cakes, roasts, hams, fried chicken, baked chicken, corn beef, fried potatoes, eggs, grilled sandwiches, spagetti sauce, gravy and anything I can think of. One of the easiest ways I use it is to put a chuck roast in. Cover it with 1/2 package of onion soup mix and 1-2 cups of water. Add potatoes and carrots. Cover and put on at 275-300 degrees. Cook for about 3 hours (perfect for those who want a meal right after church). Roast can be cut with a fork. If this gets put away it just won't get used as much, so leave it on the burner. I reseason this every so often because it can stick after I cook with water or tomatoes. If I had only one piece of cookware to take with me it would be the cast iron chicken fryer 
I made wonderful fried chicken in this pan! It has the perfect depth for frying, and an even heat distribution. I have also used it to make other recipes - it is extremely versatile 
If you like to make gumbo or even simple hearty gravies, this is the only way. The ability of cast iron to evenly distribute heat and remain flat at very high temperatures ensure that anyone can make a dark-red to black roux with confidence 
I was misled by the picture of 13 bars (a complete set). I got 5 bars which does me no good. I want to change them all. I am sending back and getting a complete set, for $50. 
"I ordered this unit for my mother. She received only the bottome portion of it in one box and in the 2nd box was only a pen and not the rest of the filter. The seller then accused my mother of lying. It's a $30 filter that I bought for her to have clean water. We order all the time from Amazon and we have never had any problems. I want the money credited back to my account immediately! Any now after asking for the refund, which has yet to be credited, they have the nerve to ask for the original boxes back, still accussing her of lying. I'm having my mother email me her scanned copy of the receipt from the store she had to go to just to get a complete working water filter. I am extremely disappointed in Tarsal for not taking care of their customers. I'm the Supervisor of Customer Service at a very large National retail store and we most certainly do not take care of our customers this way. 
I got this water filter a few days ago and it is GREAT! The water tastes cleaner and better than the tap. This product will let you chug away because one filter lasts 100 gallons of water. I live in Omaha, Nebraska and the water here is bad but, the PUR changed everything. My mother has had one for a year now and has not had ANY PROBLEMS with her PUR. The bypass feature is also a good idea. The pitcher styles are not as easy to use as the sink mount ones. Would recomend to anyone who wants to drink that 8 glasses a day without breaking the bank 
The chrome look of this unit is quite nice and really does look like chrome (doesn't look cheap like some other metallic plastics), matching chrome fixtures nicely. But the important part is that this filter really does its job. You'll find at Pur's website that the Pur Ulitmate is NSF certified to effectively filter 28 contaminants listed in NSF Standard 53, whereas some competing products, including a popular disposable model that doesn't use cartridges, claim certification for less than a third of those. I'm sure there are truly comparable filters out there, but check the specs before you buy. Flow rate seems reasonable to me. I can fill up my 12-cup coffee carafe in under a minute, and I don't mind taking a couple of extra seconds for the peace of mind that I'm drinking cleaner, safer water. After all, I won't be needing it for washing dishes or taking a shower. It's very easy to install, and it seems more durable than an older generation Pur faucet-mount filter I had that developed leaks after a while. This one has been working for almost a year with no leakage at all 
This is a very good-looking filter. We used to live in Orlando where the water tastes like sewage, so a good filtration system was a must. This filter definitely cleans the water to drinking standards and the on/off functionality is well thought out. However, this is one of the SLOWEST water filters we have tried. It starts off okay but after a week or so, we wanted to return it because it took so long just to fill a glass. We tried another filter and the same things happened. A friend who was staying with us informed us that her PUR had done the same thing. So, we went back to Target and purchased a Clear Flow for 2/3 the price of the PUR and we couldn't be happier. It has 3X the water flow and looks just as good on the faucet. Go with Clear Flow or Brita instead of PUR 
The product was familiar to me and I was very pleased to get such a quality product for a reasonable price. It was shipped and arrived here in good time. Thanks! 
We just got this chair, and Metropolitan sofa from Target for our sunroom. It has a great modern look, and a solid feel. I assembled this very easily by myself in less than half an hour. Chair cushion is firm. This is a beautiful chair that goes well with the Metropolitan collection. Great for a modern or retro look in your room 
This set has large, sturdy utensils in a beautiful no-slip ceramic crock with room for other tools. Looks great on the counter 
I bought this item for my daughter quince. I was a great buy! The motor is quite, and the light is great. However, it does splash a little when it gets a little low on liquid, but if you put a garland around the base it will catch the small droplets. It really looks pretty. I am sure to use it at the hollidays and other birthdays. But I do have to point out this fountain is a 2.5 gal not a 3 gal 
I can't rave enough about this beautiful Rival Fountain! I got it for my son's wedding shower, then the wedding, then used it 2 months after for my 11 yr old's birthday party too! We used it at the wedding reception for sweet tea of all things! It kept it elegant easy to serve. Even with the brown tea color it was still beautifully illuminated very elegant. It was elegant enough to use at the wedding reception ~ we just encircled the base with floral garland! Made serving the guests MUCH easier! I also used it 2 months later for my daughter's 11th birthday hawaiian themed party! Look below for the non alcohol Koolaid / pineapple juice fruit punch recipe! It kept the kid's coming back for more drinks! They felt like little grownups it made my birthday girl feel so special having the beverage fountain on display for her birthday. A HUGE hit with the kids! I can see myself using this for years! I got a HUGE discount shopping for it on Amazon.com - I got it for a third of the original store price! yeah me! Kid's party / or non alcohol Koolaid punch recipe: a day or two before the party you can mix 3 seperate gallons of koolaid up.( Use your old milk jugs if you have to) the Koolaid recipe calls for 1 packet unmixed koolaid powder along with 1 cup sugar. BUT ~ (* for less sugar substitute 1 cup splenda instead of the 1 c sugar per packet it normally calls for* )! Set aside at least 3 premixed Koolaids in gallon containers put in fridge to chill. When ready to serve, the day of the party pour 2 of the pre-chilled koolaid gallons into fountain, then turn fountain on. As it goes up the tube, start to add 1 full can Pineapple juice (it's about 42 oz or something like that) then add 1 litre of gingeraile (that's half of a 2 litre bottle). The kids liked to substitute half or the recipe's amount of pineapple juice as we mixed more of it, because they said the juice was so tangy sweet they like the koolaid taste better. But you can adjust the koolaid to juice ratio as needed, add only 1 litre of gingeraile to the 2 gallons of koolaid, because adding any more soda in one it will bubble up too much could kill the motor. Keep adding gallon of koolaid, juice soda as needed. Toss leftovers or chill use day after. Kids can be a bit messy so might want to put an absorbant layer of tablecloth under the fountain. 
Bought this fountain after I had borrowed one for a New Years Eve Party. This one was even better than the one I borrowed! Very sturdy, quiet, and easy to put together and clean. The light in the middle makes this a great eye catcher, I kept getting compliments on it all night! This is a great product at a great price. Shipping was fast too 
What a wonderful adult toy. After seeing one of these fountains in operation at a Christmas party and noticing how useful, effective and popular it was with everyone, my wife and I decided we would get one. Thanks to the power of the internet and Amazon, we now have one. We may not use it as a soft drink fountain at all, but as a decorative water piece in the house as a distraction from the dreadful winter we are having just now. John K. Sutherland 
I recieved the fountain on time and everyone was amaized at it,I will be using it often in our churc 
Perfect NON-Alcoholic beverage/punch dispenser/display for our daughter's Sweet 16 Birthday Bash at our church 
Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain. The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. This pan holds 2 1/2 quarts of food, measures 7 3/4 x 11 1/2 inches internally, and weighs 6 1/2 pounds. 2 1/2 quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. This may be the pan for families from 2-4. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot.  I find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese, while not so desirable for other dishes. Add the Le Creuset 7 1/2 x 9 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease. Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles, pork chops covered with cornbread dressing, dinner rolls, baked squash, scalloped potatoes, cobblers, pineapple upside down cake, or bread pudding. The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination. One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. PROS: Extremely versatile Efficient absorption and distribution of heat Hygienic enamel cooking surface Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors Easy to clean when not abused or misused Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table Can easily last a lifetime CONS: Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 6 1/2 pounds 
I have three, yes 3, of these in my shower. One for my face soap, one for mild body soap, and one for antibacterial soap. These sort of hang down so the soap scum doesn't get on the wall -- it drips on the shower floor. I don't even use the built in ceramic soap holder because it just gets soap scum in it. THESE ARE GREAT! You will find it much easier to keep you shower clean by using these soap holders 
This fan is just beautiful. Very clean lines and it doesn't look old-fashioned like most ceiling fans. It's also very, very easy to install. Three wires connect to the fan from the remote receiver and three to your home wiring. The blades snap right into place and once the plate is mounted to your receptacle box (fan rated of course) the fan goes into place and is held by four screws. There's a little hook on the mounting plate that you can use to hold the fan in place while you make all the connections. I wish every lighting fixture had that. At low speed you can barely hear it and it seems to move quite a bit of air. It appears to be extremely well built and the fit and finish is perfect. It comes with a remote that has three fan speeds, a stop and a reverse for the fan and on/off/dimmer switch for the light 
Great product, easy to clean. We purchased this mainly for grating cheese, much cheaper to buy a block of cheese also many more varieties to choose from. will be great for many things though! 
I have had this product for a couple of days now and don't know why I never tried it before. It works great and you don't have to cut cucumber or small potatoes. I had seen the cuisinart on tv and almost bought it and thought about the salad shooter. I am a single senior and do not have the need for such a pricey one but needed it as I am getting rid of heavy food processor but still wanted to be able to slice and shred. Should have bought this long ago. Saves space. Can you tell I love love it 
This is the 2nd one I've had. The first lasted about 18 years. Hopefully the second will last that long also. Use it daily for all garden products and cheese. Can't live without it 
perfect for grating cheese, the hardest thing to grate .... messy to hand wash but fine in dishwasher ... worth it ... wise bu 
Now I can chop or shred anything for my salads! Great product, I recommend it 
Afetr reading the reviews, I was still a little skeptical and thought could shredding cheese really be that easy? Well it's easy, breezy and completely mess free!! The parts you do use are dishwasher safe so you're done with your shredding and cleaning in minutes. The motor is powerful and the slicer works great as well. I cannot imagine being without this neat gadget in my kitchen 
I have owned the smaller Salad Shooter for many years (and it still works!) and have always loved the ease of use and easy cleaning (I stick it right in the dishwasher), so I wanted the bigger one to try coleslaw with it. I think I'll stick to my food processor for the cabbage shredding because I had to cut the cabbage up too small, but this will do almost everything else with ease, it's very powerful. I love it to shred cheese, carrots, etc. The extra attachments give you a lot of variety in slice thickness. And the best thing is you can aim it right over the bowl or dish that you're preparing and the food will shoot right in without dirtying another bowl! Great for summer salads! I bought my daughter one too and she loves it 
The Presto 02790 is probably great for many things but for my house it's great for shredding cheese for mexican food, a staple in our household 
Excellent. It arrived quite quickly and is absolutely awesome. We had an older salad shooter that had worked well, but could not compare to the professional model. And the price at Amazon was great, plus no shipping charge. Great job Amazon 
I purchased this item hoping that it would make leveling and torting round cakes easier. The blade (a simple wire) does nothing to work through a sturdier or crusty cake, and in the process of trying to get it to do so, the cake gets damaged. I had nothing but problems with this item, and had to use my trusty bread knife to repair the damage from the leveler! I am back to using my knife to level and torte my cakes, and feel stupid for wasting the money on this item. My recommendation: stick with the tried and true method. It works perfectly every time 
This leveler worked great but only on cakes that have soft (not crusty) sides. Since the cutting blade is only a wire, cutting through anything too hard or crumbly is difficult. It would be nicer if instead of a wire it had a serrated blade. But if you do have a crusty cake, you can simply wrap the cake in plastic wrap and let it sit a day. This will soften the sides so that this leveler will still work. Also, keep in mind this leveler is only 10 inches wide and 2 inches high, so you may get into trouble with larger cakes. It works great for torting a cake and getting those really thin layers. It sure is a lot easier than using a knife 
We bought some white wine glasses a while back and the Metrokane Rabbits were truly beautiful. We use them 10:1 over our Reidels. After my wife broke ANOTHER Reidel burgundy glass, I ordered these. They are HUUUUGE. I'm very serious when I say that an entire bottle of wine would easily fit into one of these glasses (with room to spare!) There is nothing attractive about THESE monsters and storage is a big issue (literally.) They would make a fine fish bowl 
I own Reidel Sommelier glasses, Reidel Vinum glasses, and Reidel Extreme glasses. I put these Rabbit glasses into the same category as the Vinums from Reidel; they are great everyday glasses for people like me who tend to drink fairly good wines and tend to drink fairly hefty-sized portions. These glasses are certainly not in the same category as Reidel Sommeliers, but then again they cost about 1/4 as much. 
Do not order these glasses! I ordered them after reading about them in Wine Spectator, well what they did not say was how big these glasses are!!! HUGE!! I pulled them out of the box and laughed, there is no way they would fit in my cabinets. Great idea (no lead glasses) but they need to be a bit smaller. I returned them and had to pay shipping as Amazon says it is not their fault that I do not like the item, something to keep in mind 
Cuts like the best knife I've ever used. Looks cool - though my wife says the Damascus-ripples make it look dirty. Feels comfortable in my hand. If I was in a horror-slasher movie and needed a knife to defend myself from the creepy-crawlies, I'd want this knife to be the one my scrabbling fingers find as I desparately grope across the kitchen counters. note: Packaging is cheesy, and you don't want to just throw this in a drawer, so you need a block or magnet rack or something to store it 
Purchased one for $33 and love it. I've had the Calphalon essential set for about 3 years and have been happy with the balance and handling. I mainly use the 6" utility and the 3 1/2" pairing knife. However,I found the thickness of the blade on 7" chef knife to make it slightly dull for me on many task. The katana knife is in a entire different league from Calphalon's orginal set. It cuts with very little effort and has great balance. 
This knife feels great in the hand and arrives very sharp. I am not sure what is the point of the layers of Damascene. The last half inch before the edge is presumably is where the action takes place and it is good, old-fashioned clear stainless. The Damascene pattern is certainly attractive. Despite report you may have heard to the contrary, the edge of the blade is not straight like a Santoku knife. It curves, more-or-less the same amount as a Henckels chef knife. Having said that, I guess if you are a die-hard chopper you might prefer a big belly Wusthof. The bolster is very unobtrusive, which I like. The handle is comfortable and tilts up a little, sort of like the Global knives but less extreme. Did I already say this knife arrives very sharp. Right out of the box you can cut through the stem of a banana almost as if it was celery. Don't let your 8-year old use this knife for cutting frozen bagels ;) All-in-all it is a really nice knife that I would use all the time if my wife had not taken such a posessive interest in it 
i've only used it a few times. i bought it when it was on sale for 35 dollars. very good for the price. i'm sure there's probably sharper knives out there but for 35 dollars, you can't beat that. this is why i gave it five stars. it's also a cool looking knife. but even for 50 dollars, i think this is a good knife to get. but really, i think when it comes to knives, everyone has their own opinion. so good luck 
If you're a confirmed tea drinker, then get this type of teapot. It's the best. There are many sizes out there, although I prefer the little one for my solo drinking adventures. My only complaint with Japanese iron teapots is that sometimes they rust around the handle rings...although I find that the ochre colored dust adds to their overall charm 
perfect I love them..I have been looking everywhere for these and finally found them here 
I really like this it makes great little 'cookies' that my family loved. It is fairly easy to use but there is a learning curve on how much batter to place on the forms. Great Item 
This krumkaka baker is wonderful!! I have a stove-top krumkaka maker and always had trouble with it, took a long time to bake krumkaka and such. Made a batch of krumkaka right away after receiving the new electric baker and match a full batch in less than an hour and they were delish!! I would highly recommend this baker to anyone that has ever considered buying one, it is a wonderful machine!! Love the non-stick surface!! 
I was looking for a pizzelle maker and after extensive research, this was the best option, including the price. These cookies are wonderful and the Krumkake maker works great. It heats up the way it should and the instructions are easy to follow. 
This is my first time to use an electric krumkake baker as I previously had the old type you use over the stove.I feel the baker doesn't bake evenly on both sides........the top of the krumkake cookie is nice but the bottom remains on the soggy side which leads me to believe the heat is uneven.Also there is no indicator light to let you know when the cookie is done. Therefore you have to really pay attention to your time. Usually it took only 55 seconds to a minute. Also hard to get two cookies commpletely round..... batter ran into each other. Perhaps my batter was too runny but have used this recipe before on the old iron without trouble.I'm at the point that perhaps the single baker would be better than the double. HOpe to find a person that could demonstrate the two cookie krumkake maker......perhaps that would help. Trying to be open-minded! 
I hadn't made krumkake since I was 1975! I loved making them again and the maker was GREAT! It is easy to clean too. A different and delicious treat. I loved this product 
I used to make these during "kakelinna" (time in Norway when Christmas baking begins) with my "farmor" (paternal grandmother). I still have my grandmother's old cast iron krumkake iron and after trying this one, I will never deviate from the traditional iron again. Christmas baking in Norway isn't about making a lot and saving time, it's about family. Although the older ones take longer (but taste better), it is a great time to reflect. If you have the energy to use a traditional one, I recommend it...the cookies are temporary, memories are forever 
This item is fantastic!! Having just tried Krumkake this past May while visiting family in Alaska, we were excited to come home and try to make them ourselves. They are similar to Pizelles, but better. We couldn't wait for this maker to arrive and made krumkake the very next day. They were so good. We would recomend this item to anyone who ever tried krumkake and wants to relive thay wonderful memory at home!! It perfectly made two krumkake in less than 1 minute and comes with a great rolling cone to shape them. We ate ours plain, but I am sure they are fantastic with powdered sugar or many of the wonderful fillings the directions suggest. We just couldn't wait to decorate them or fill them. I will definitely be making these wonderful cookies this Christmas to share with our family. Hope you enjoy!! 
I love my new cookies's maker. It so easy to use and fast to get good cookies for dessert 
I love it so much! It is so easy to use and the Krumkate came out very thin. However the product is "made in China" not "made in USA" as indicated under its description. I experienced that the cookies came out rather dark, so I used a timer instead of waiting for the light. It will take approximately one minute and 45 seconds for each cookie. I set mine as one minute and 25 seconds. If you want a thin krumkate, your batter should be thin. The thinner, the faster it will take, so adjust your timer accordingly. It is easy to clean with a dam towel or paper towe 
After spending many years using a manual cast-iron stove-top Krumkake baker, shoulder arthritis made it impossible. I actually dreaded the season and the Krumkake I always made to give as gifts. With my new electric Krumkake baker, I just made a batch in only 1 hour (usually took 3 hours on the stove), no burned fingers and no shoulder arthitic problem! And my very first krumkake turned out perfectly (it usually took me about 5 to "get it right" with my stove-top system). Thanks for a terrific product and recipe. I'll use it all year (not only at Christmastime) 
I have this pan and I seriously love it. I love the versatility. We have used it for housewarming gifts for new neighbors as well as for cakes for my decorating business. The cakes have all come out fabulously and they have not stuck at all. It's a fabulous cake pan. Probably good for monkey bread, blueberry bread or anything else you can imagine as well. Have FUN with it! 
I purchased this set as a gift. I wanted the good stuff. My own set has lasted over ten years. I would give it five stars if it was dishwasher friendly,it's not.It does clean up real easy 
Is there a better measuring cup? It is ergonomic--soft rubber handle, read from above and all that. But look at the design. This cup should be in a museum collection if it is not already. Buy all three--comes in 1 cup, 2 cup, and a mini (2 oz. without a handle) and you will have a nifty display of modern sculpture in your kitchen. 
The OXO 2-cup stainless measuring cup is the perfect measuring cup. It won't crack when you pour boiling water in it. It is shaped and marked so you can easily look down from the top and see just exactly how much you have put in it. I admit I didn't quite believe that till I got it. It is 100% true. The handle is the typical OXO black insulated material so you don't get burned and it is balanced to make pouring easy. The "funnel" lip avoids spills. It is truly the perfect measuring cup im my opinion 
I love this pan it is perfect for making pancakes or a few grilled cheeses 
This is the bowl I reach for consistently. It holds a lot without taking up lots of counter space and stores efficiently. It has high enough sides so that the kids don't slop pancake batter all over. And, the non-slip bottom is a godsend! You have to own this bowl 
These bowls are very nice and they do not move about while you stir your "whatever". They are worth the cost and you will be pleased with any of them. They pour well and the hand grip is useful in handling the bowl. Good items 
This bowl has a nice weight to it, doesn't slide around on the counter, and has a soft comfortable grip. Great bowl 
I own every size of this bowl and if they made more I'd buy them. In fact I'm thinking about throwing away all my other bowls and just buying several more of these. They are absolutely the greatest mixing bowls ever made. They won't slide around (the bottow is rubber or something like it) they are steep sided so things don't splash out, they are easy to clean, and they look great, I could just could go on and on with praise about these bowls. I'm 63 years old and I cook a lot, I've never had a better product. Buy these, you won't be disappointed 
I have this bowl and the smaller one. They are perfect bowls for mixing. The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put. I was them in the dishwasher without any problems 
This mixing bowl is a good size for most any task. Its easy to use and clean up is easy. Great Quality 
Does everything claimed and is useful for many things 
I bought the 4 quart first and loved it but it was too large for some things so ordered this one and just adore it. It's the perfect size to mix my little salads in, pancake batter, meat loaf..you name it and it fits..the small things. Love the non-slip bottom, the handle, the pouring spout, the high sides..everything about it and nothing but praise here. 5 Stars all the way : 
Love it, love it, love it! I didn't buy it until I read every single review and decided I had to try it. High sides make for easy stirring, no slip bottom is AWESOME as I always did the bowl chase when trying to stir batters..rubber handle is a plus for grabbing and holding on, spout great for what I purchased it for: pouring batter for pancakes/waffles and easy clean. My husband refuses to mix in any bowl but that one so I constantly have to wash it out to get a turn! Awesome. 
Hinky open/shut mechanism. It takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open. If it weren't so heavy, I would've returned it long ago 
I have just purchased this chest. The first thing I read from the packing box was this product is not intended to protect computer disks, CDs, tapes, videos. This was not mentioned at all in product description on 3 to 4 website that I checked before I decided to buy it. I was more than disappointed. I feel that the seller was evasive... 
Approx. exterior measurements: 15w x 14-1/2d x 8h (Item was bigger than I expected from online pic) Can hold 8x11 papers without folding, just barely big enough for a 9x12 envelope. No shipping problems, item in perfect condition. Some similar items were listed as being made with plastic that scissors could cut through. This is not the case with this item. It appears very solid. Hinges are not visible and lock appears solid. When I purchased this item, I was just looking for something to protect documents against fire and water damage. I wasn't counting on something that looked like a mini-safe. I am pleasantly surpised. 
Came well packaged, and in perfect shape. We love it and will continue to for many years. 
This bread box is just lovely. Mine arrived in perfect condition. The interior measurements are 15" long by 8.5" wide. The box is 6" deep. The wooden lid is lovely although I don't plan on using mine as a bread board so I can preserve it. I did need to air mine out for a few days when it arrived. There are air holes on each side but it had that brand new paint smell and needed to be completely open for a while before regular use. I love having my bread out of sight in a container that really adds something special to my kitchen's decor 
well it was a gift but it looked sturdy and well made. i don not know if the receipent has hung it yet or if any bats have moved in 
This is a great product. Very lightweight and comfortable. I have enjoyed using this for my Mac Powerbook. The surface is wide enough for the laptop and an external mouse. I highly recommend it 
the best laptop desk I've ever found; if you get size larger than your laptop, you'll have space at side with amazingly good surface for an optical mouse; whole thing is very sturdy well constructed, even though it's very lightweigh 
We purchased the Lapinator Plus for $30 plus shipping, as well as the jumbo "Microbead" lap desk for half that price ($15.99). The microbead desk has a much thicker molded plastic top; the microbead filled base pad conforms to your lap much better and is more comfortable; it's 2 inches wider, 1 inch longer, and accomodates my widescreen laptop better; and it has two pencil wells and a clip on one end so it can be used for a lap desk without the computer: Again, all for half the price of the Lapinator. The Lapinator Plus has a flimsy, light weight piece of vinyl for a top, a stitched edge, and an uncomfortable foam base that puts my legs to sleep. Buyer beware! Check out the microbead lap desk first. 
I bought this on Amazon back in January 2007. I love it-use it almost every day. Very light weight and helps my legs cool. I have a mac book pro and got the 18" I could fit the mouse on the space but choose not too-almost too tight to fit the laptop-(15") and a mouse. I highly recommend this product 
Or other widescreen laptop computer, or even just want some extra mouse-space, this lap desk is a fantastic choice. It even comes with rubber feet to help elevate your laptop for cooling, if the feet on your machine aren't doing the job. This also helps keep the machine from sliding at all on the smooth surface of the lap desk. Having looked for a lap desk as a gift for my room mate I wanted something, lightweight and portable but large enough to be functional and over all to be comfortable. The Lapinator Plus was all that, and then some. Eventually, I'm going to get one for myself 
For many reasons, the only way I can use my laptop is........on my lap. Think HOT, HOT, HOT after several hours. Being in the boondocks, I had no idea there were actual products to remedy my problem (can you say 'Google'?) In a nutshell, the Lapinator is great and does all it says. I was only concerned in the heat factor, but a great side benefit is how much more comfortable my wrists and arms are with the Lapinator. Plus the Lapinator seems to grip the computer, so it stays put........never realized how much it wobbled. I'm so pleased with my Lapinator that I have bought one for my son-in-law who works on his laptop everywhere....on the sofa, in an airplane. He's thrilled with his, too. I might add that shipping was great, also. You can't beat the price, but at double the cost, I'd buy another one if needed 
So far it seems to work as advertised. The only complaint I have is that the price is more than I would have payed had I seen the product first. Its not rediculously overpriced but it could be a little cheaper. Otherwise it is a sturdy lapdesk. Overall I am pleased 
The only problem: I tried to figure how you could make the label harder to remove from the surface and came up with nothing 
Wow!!! When I saw this light and simple design, I was not sure what to expect. I used this for an entire day, working on a paper with my laptop. It really did keep my lap totally cool! It's light and comfortable! I also set the Lapinator Plus on the couch with my laptop on it. That worked like a charm, too! The underside of the Lapinator never felt hot to the touch. My laptop doesn't shift at all, whether it's on my lap, the couch or the bed. This is a great product, and worth the price, in my humble opinion! It's plenty sturdy without being heavy, yet it is not flimsy at all. What an achievement in design and construction! 
Does not spit or leak; VERY powerful steam action; can steam hanging clothes with the iron held vertically; glides smoothly; and is solid and well engineered 
I HAD to review this after reading the only other review for this fan. I am certain I have reviewed this fan for Amazon before, but for some reason don't see it here. I use two of these fans to move air around in my 20x10 Swiss Gear tent while camping in Texas. It is made from plastic and like all other plastic products, it is breakable if you muscle your way to using it wrong, but usage is fairly straight forward. To open the leg, simply swing it down from the back of the fan on its hinge. Opening the battery compartment is fairly simple as well if you understand what lock, and unlock icons mean. The fan moves LOTS of air, and the ones I own have taken plenty of abuse being tossed into and out of the back of my truck for the last two years. My only complaint with them is the battery compartment cover is a little tough to get back on until you figure out exactly how it works, and on high it will suck an expensive set of D cell batteries down in 24 hours. If you use these a lot, I would STRONGLY recommend getting a couple of sets of rechargable D cells and a charger, OR getting the model with the built in rechargable batteries. I like that this model is also available with a transformer that you can use to run it off of 110v power, which makes camping in sites with electricity much less of a drain in the wallet! I rated this fan a 5 as I feel it is the best of its breed. It is NOT to be compared to a corded box fan or anything like that since you do different things with them. But this fan is the absolute best of its kind that I have tried. I have used several different models from Coleman, this thing moves so much more air that there really is no comparison. The Coleman fans simply do not move air like this thing does.. 
I got my raclette as a Christmas present and it is one of the best gifts I've ever received! I love to have people over and this provides a unique and easy way to serve dinner or snacks to everyone's tastes. Everyone really has fun with it. This particular raclette works very well. I have no complaints. The only word of warning I'd give to would be buyers is that it's not for kids. That may seem obvious to some, but we always have kids that want to participate in the fun...it's inevitable around my house with five of my own...and it creates a lot more work to keep them from being burned. Otherwise it's an awesome product that we enjoy more than our fondue and chocolate fountain 
I learned of Raclette while living in Germany several years ago and found upon return to the States, that they were no where to be found. Now they are available and I love the one I bought. In fact, I am ordering another as a late Christmas gift. It is great for dinner parties and keeps guests happy they are eating what they selected and cooked to their liking 
We are very pleased with our HB Raclette Grill! We originally tried raclette cooking in France with friends and bought our own. We've used it for entertaining and daily dining, and everyone has a blast with it! All you have to do is prepare food items (potatoes, cheese, deli meats, veggies, eggs, etc) and each person cooks up their own combination. As the food cooks/heats you enjoy great conversation with up to eight friends, over the raclette and perhaps a glass of wine. Cleaning is simple given the removable parts and non-stick cooking surfaces. The machine is quite handsome (more stylish than other comparables) with those crescent handles and nifty (baby) pans. The grill that rests on top is very useful and easily removable. The machine comes with the temperature dial on one side and the red indicator light, letting you know that the machine is plugged in (heating is fairly quick). The heat resistant plastic (baby) spatulas are surprisingly versatile. (Some other raclettes don't come with an indicator light or spatulas!) If I had to note anything I didn't fully appreciate, it would be that the machine doesn't seem to have an off mode, other than pulling the plug. The only other thing to mention is concerning grill cooking. If the heat is up high and you leave fatty foods or oil on top, splatter can occur firing unfriendly projectiles/globules and making clean up a bit more work. This is true of any indoor grill though. Just be careful. All in all, we love the raclette and use it happily and quite often! It is highly recommended 
I first tried a Raclette prepared meal in 2002 while visiting my fiancee's parents in Lyon, France. Needless to say I was hooked straight away. Although Raclette meals can be heavy (potatoes, cheese and various meats and veg), they are extremely good. The Hamilton beach 31602 raclette grill is great. Temperature control is a nice feature. I have used it a lot since I bought it and recommend it. Good value for money and even has some recipes to try in the instruction manual. 
I bought this Raclette grill to add to an existing collection. I was a bit hesitant because I typically do not purchase Hamilton Beach products. I have to say, I like this machine better than my other more expensive European models. It certainly is great value for money and easy to use. I highly recommend it! 
This raclette grill meets my every expectation.It was a great value for the price 
The HB 31602 is an excellent raclette grill at a price well below that of most other raclettes on the market now. This is my second grill; the first - a Swiss-made machine - died after about 10 years of use. I decided to try the HB because of its features and attractive price, as well as my previous favorable experience with Amazon in the event I wanted to return the item. In short, the unit functions perfectly. Its variable temperature control (a must for raclette cooking) does its job well. Clean up - a frequent gripe among raclette grill reviewers - is a breeze....assuming that you only use the top grill to cook normal raclette-type foods such as small potatoes, sausages or Canadian bacon, not frying eggs, and that you treat the non-stick surface properly. Although the listing copy doesn't make this clear, the unit comes with both the rectangular pans and the plastic scrapers. And the cord length (another often-heard complaint) is quite adequate. The only potential shortcoming is the way the item is shipped -- in its retail box only, the way you would pick it up at a store. That means the only thing between your grill and the rough world of a UPS trip is a few pieces of egg-carton packing and a flimsy, non-corrugated box....a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, my unit arrived OK though the box was pretty beat up. Amazon should require its third party 'partners' to use shipping cartons, like Amazon itself always does. (On the positive side, my one experience with Amazon re a shipping-damaged item was very satisfactory. 
Actually, I don't own this particular machine, but am considering purchasing it. I have two Krups machines - a combination machine, the Cafe Duomo, and an old venerable Espresso Mini that's used mostly for travel and for when we need more espresso capacity for when we have guests over. I have no complaints with either machine, and in fact would consider myself well-chuffed with both machines. I've been using distilled water to make espresso for about 20 years, and as a result, have never had to de-scale. Additionally, regarding cleaning the steam nozzle - it's best to clean it immediately after frothing - that way, the milk is still soft and easy to remove with a wet cloth. If you allow the milk to dry or to otherwise build up on the steam nozzle tube after multiple uses, said buildup will harden and become a much more difficult proposition to remove. Regarding that "Perfect Froth Attachment" - well, my first Krups Espresso Mini, vintage early 80's, was before the PFA was introduced, so I "grew up" steaming frothing milk sans PFA. On subsequent Krups machines that came with the PFA, I opted to remove same, as I could see what a cleaning and sanitary issue it would become. Hope this info helps 
When the first one died after 12 years of use, we replaced it with the same model. Very reliable, good quality and does a decent job of espresso and steamed milk although it's by no means a real professional's unit. The one thing that has consistenly bugged me is the shape of the spout on the coffeepot. For some reason I literally cannot pour it when near full without the water or coffee sticking to the side of the pot and running down and dribbling off the bottom. So every morning I have this ritual of filling the water and then cleaning up all the water that the darned pot dribbles off the side, and then pouring coffee and cleaning coffee off the counter. I assure you all I have reasonable coordination. But we really like the unit otherwise 
I love having a combination machine. However, the espresso maker really, really does not work well. When you tamp down the coffee grounds it clogs up and the water can't pass through. You end up getting about 2 drops of espresso at a time. To make one espresso drink, I have to brew it about 3 times. It's quite inconvenient. I'm just waiting for my machine to break so I can justify getting a different one 
I am really pleased with this machine. It makes a wonderful cup of regular coffee and using it for espresso and cappuchino is quite easy. When I opened it I was a little concerned because it looks complicated - but its not. Directions are clear. My purchase experience was great as well. I recommend it. Its a tidy package and I don't have to litter my counter tops with several coffee machines - this does it all 
We've used the Cuisinart Grind Brew for over 8 years, but recently decided we needed an upgrade! After searching and reading reviews by others, decided on this machine. We were not disappointed; although this machine doesn't grind the beans, it makes a great cup of regular coffee, and the espresso and cappuccino features are very easy to use, and make a great cuppa, as my Aussie Mother-in-law says! My husband also likes the easy clean up, since that's his job! 
I have been very pleased with our coffee/espresso maker. It is very simple to use for beginners like myself and easy to clean. It is also a nice size so it does not overwhelm the counter. The instructions were very clear and I had no trouble using the frother, it just took a little practice. 
The espresso compressor broke after two months so we had to return the product. The former was hard to use, too, never warm up milk to the temperature we wanted to be. For brewing coffee, it worked fine, but then a normal coffee maker is enough to serve that needs 
This is one great Coffee maker for the price. Espresso temperature isn't too hot, but the cappucino maker is fantastic. The instructions are very straight forward and I was able to make a good cup of cappucino on my first try 
I purchased one of these about 12 years ago at an auction, and fell in love with it. It worked beautifully for 12 years [making coffee at least once per day, and espresso several times per week]. When it finally died, I searched for it, but wanted to see if I could just buy something cheaper. I bought Krups and non-Krups machines - and returned every one of them and opted to go back to this machine despite it slightly higher price. This is the best coffee ever, and the espresso is perfect! 
This is a great idea for quickly wrapping around your coiled hose hanging on a nail in the garage 
My first review of this item was two stars. However, after having contact with Sharper image, I am now changing my rating to four stars. Sharper Image is a company with integrity and they truly stand behind their customer guarantee 
It does keep the coffee fresh!! We depend on it. Buy it!! It even looks great 
I bought this sofa about 6 months ago. Already, I can feel all the springs in the sofa. The springs croak loudly everytime someone sits on the sofa or gets up from it. I have contacted Target 3 times. They do not have any information on the manufacturer, and warranty on this product. So, if you buy this product, you are on your own. It is better to stay away from this product at all costs 
We ordered this sofa and matching ottoman on Target.com with a discount we recieved via email. It has far exceeded our expectations! I read all the reviews and they are dead on. The upholstery IS darker. The cushions are firm and comfortable. It's very nice. The frame is solid and the fabric luxurious. The only problem we had is with the freight conractor that Target used being slow to communicate. But, it did arrive in one piece and was easy to put together (having 2 people helped). If you are thinking about this couch....go ahead! You won't be sorry. It's high quality and affordable! This is very durable and looks like it costs twice as much. I would buy it all over again! We love it 
I liked the loveseat so much that I bought the couch. It's comfy, supportive, and not too difficult to put together from the pictures. The frame is sturdy, but I suggest adding some glue to the 2 pieces screwed onto the back (which support the seat) just for added strength. 
I can't express how satisfied I am with this collection. I purchased the entire Expresso/Mocha set and it has transformed my living room into a "Home Makeover" worthy work of art. The web doesn't do it justice. It is much prettier and is finer than the pics can portray. Very easy to assemble and you "oohhhh, and ahhhh" while you do it because you can't believe how good it looks for the price. Yes, we all clapped when we were done because it looks so fabulous. Thank goodness for target.co 
We actually purchased the 4 piece set (unfortunately leaving a review was not an option there.) It is indeed a hardwood frame, and beautiful suede-like microfiber cusions that have zip-off covers. The color is definitely more along the lines of a hot chocolate color rather than the creamy chai color on the screen- but still blends beautifully into a neutral palette. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The assembly was a bit challenging- you may need a third or fourth hand. The instructions certainly aren't complete enough- they are more like general pictures, so there's a bit of guesswork involved. The upholstered side panels take a bit of elbow grease to fit into the frame properly. Took us about an hour to put together with a few do-over adjustments for precision. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I love that the back cushions have velcro to hold them on and in place. The cushions are also surprizingly firm, but because the seat is longer than average legs, you have a tendancy to lounge. I'm not sure what the weight restrictions are, but we had about 700 lbs on the couch and it remained in one piece (can't say that for all couches we've had!) Overall a very impressive package for the price! We received free shipping and used a 10% off online coupon code so it was a great deal. I also highly suggest the matching table set 
It was a little tricky to put together by myself, and the instructions could have been clearer....but now it's done, and I LOVE my new sofa! It's so much nicer than I expected to get for this price. I highly recommend the matching tables, too 
We got this just after Christmas, and it is absolutely the best cup of coffee that we have had since we were in Italy. I can't stand to drink drip coffee anymore. There are several things to keep in mind for the best results. (1) Use good filtered or spring water (2) Use a finely ground good coffee, such as Illy (3) pack it just slightly in the filter (4) Don't try to rush it by turning the heat up too high (5) NEVER put it in the dish washer. We have been using the organic espresso blend from Whole Foods, and it is almost as good as the Illy. All in all, this is easier and faster than most coffee makers and gives us a nice two servings of espresso in the morning. Add a little milk if you like, but it's also great straight out of the pot 
I have used this model of Bialetti 3-cup coffee maker for years; this is the exact model my Dad used when he showed me how to make Cuban coffee. Cuban-style coffee is very similar to Italian espresso (both are made from finely-ground espresso beans) but is sweeter and stronger. The manufacturer includes an instruction booklet but if you've never made coffee before it could be a little confusing at first. Buy yourself a stainless steel creamer and a set of espresso cups. Add four heaping teaspoons of sugar to the creamer. Follow the instructions in the booklet to make the coffee. When the coffee finishes brewing, add two teaspoons of coffee to the creamer. Stir the coffee and sugar together until it forms a consistency similar to mousse (it will be dark at first but will lighten as you mix it). Now add the rest of your coffee to the creamer and stir until all the sugar dissolves. Pour immediately into the cups and serve (you should have enough to fill two cups). The coffee will form a nice, thick head on it just like a pint of Guinness. Enjoy! 
This is your basic Italian single shot espresso maker for the stovetop. I used practically the same model for almost a year while in Florence. I'm tracking down some killer Illy dark coffee to run through this puppy and am salivating until I can find a can. It works very well. This unit produces a very small amount of very strong coffee. About the same as a single espresso from that corporate giant in Seattle. ***** The keys to success are: 1. fill water no higher than the nut (pressure relief valve) on the side of the bottom section, and 2) use only low to medium (at most) heat to keep it from boiling over. Yum 
I've been using this every day since I received it over a month ago. It works perfectly. It's more than paid for itself with the savings of not running out for a latte and it makes a great cup. I can't say enough good about it 
Great coffee maker. You have to be very attentive during the brewing process so you remove the maker from the stove as soon as the coffee is ready. Also - never carelessly place it on the stove where the plastic handle is above a flame. 
I love this product! It makes the perfect amount of espresso to start my day off right. It's easy to set up and easy to clean. My only complaint is that the rings of these espresso makers wear out too quickly. 
The product is as sdvertized and is very simple to use. I am not a coffee connisseur but I do enjoy a good espresso. It has never been bitter or burned. I am very pleased with this product 
A) This little, cheap device makes wonderful coffee. B) It's termed a "3 cup" because Italians generally drink this coffee in small, 2oz cups. Serving size: two sips 
Fortunately, ours didn't break during shipment. I am not too crazy about this pattern, but still bought this set just b/c it was the best one available in my price range. They are quite heavy (a bit too heavy for everyday use) and will last a long time. I really like the large bowl and especially the design of the lids! The lids are so light and easy to grab, place and remove. The flat design makes it easy to store in your fridge, which to me is a big plus over those bulky traditional corningware glass lids 
Item looked nice in the store so I ordered it from Amazon.com. Similar to what another reviewer mentioned, the items arrived BROKEN. Return was not a problem but because of the fragile nature of these itrems, you would be better off buying this at a local store. 
I like the other lady ordered the Textured Leaves products. I ordered two each of the rectangle baking dish and two sets of ramekins, and one each of the 3pc bowl set and the covered bowls/cookware. All were shipped in perfect condition and the shipping was free via Amazon. I plan to order more pieces. The product itself is quite heavy and study. I was amazed by the weight of the pieces. I look forward to using the new additions to my Textured leaves dishes and cookware. Thanks 
I ordered several items from the collection "Texture Leaves" by Corelle Corrdinates and twice the 4-piece casserole bake serve set was broken in shipment. The other items were replaced and made the second shipment. I recommend ordering the 4 piece casserole somewhere else or buying in a store. 
I've had my H-B Step Savor Skillet/Griddle for several months now, and I am very happy with it. The griddle accomodates four medium-sized pancakes, and the small lip around the edge keeps the batter off my countertops. The skillet gets hot enough to brown hamburger meat and has enough capacity to prepare a substantial main dish for a family of 4-6. The temperature control has temperature markings for both the griddle and the skillet, since the skillet temperature runs lower than the griddle. Clean-up is easier than with traditional electric skillets. You don't need to worry about immersing the electrical components because the skillet lifts off the base (which is the griddle) and can be washed like any non-stick cookware. The griddle wipes clean with a paper towel or damp sponge. Though I'm not much for home entertaining, I can imagine this electric skillet being very handy -- you can cook in it, then turn the temperature down to keep the food warm for as long as you need to. The lid has an adjustable vent in it to control the moisture level inside. I only wish that the non-stick coating was a bit tougher. I've been careful to avoid scratches so far, but I know it's only a matter of time. I just hope that H-B keeps making these clever kitchen tools, because when this one becomes unusable, I'll certainly buy another one 
I bought this for my boyfriend and I to use in the tiny 360 sq. ft. cottage that we live in. I love that it's both a skillet and a griddle (or a "skiddle") so we get maximum function in the smallest package. We've already used it to make pancakes, sausage links, eggs, chicken, and some delicious cheese crisps. It heats up fast and is very easy to clean. It's the perfect size for cooking for two people and is designed to that it doesn't take up more counter space than it needs to. I would highly recommend this 
I think this griddle/skillet combo is fantastic. I use mine almost every day. The only problems that I have encountered are: once I dropped it while putting it away, and part of the plastic base broke off. This has made it more difficult to pick up, but it still works fine, and it was an accident. Also, the nonstick coating has been scratching lately. It does get a lot of use, but I was hoping that it would last longer. I am planning to buy another one though 
The Hamilton Beach is the perfect griddle to use on a regular basis. Even Heat, easy to clean and takes very little Space. 
The fry pan is easy to use and clean, the skillet part is easy to remove when heated, and also stores well in the provided tray holder. We use it every day, what a wonderful machine!!! 
The Step Savor performs excellent. I love it ! I highly recommend it 
Although the concept is excellent, the execution is an utter failure. The nonstick coating peels in less than 2 months. The temperature controls are pretty useless. The only setting that really works if you want to cook anything is high. The paint that indicates the controls starts to wipe off after the first week of ownership. At about two months after you purchase it you want to throw it out the window. I would have given it no stars if I was able. Do yourself a big favor, do not buy this product. You will definitely be disppointed if you buy it. I purchased one and thought maybe a just got a bad unit. The second one was just as bad. If they had spent a little more time on the execution of it and not gone so cheap on the coating and it actually cooked on another setting it would be a great product. 
Our family has purchased 7 of these cookers. It DOES NOT STICK and maintains temperature perfectly. It sits on top of my cooktop which I rarely use anymore. A must-have for every kitchen 
We were somewhat skeptical about buying a dual purpose skillet/griddle but after using found it to be the best! We use the griddle all the time and like the deep skillet that provides for cooking large roasts 
This works well. You do have to adjust the oven temp for the darker pan. I was worried about using non non-stick tools on it, but it did not scratch. 
OK Im not a great pizza maker. I donot know what went wrong, but my top portion of the pizza browned but botton crust was not cooked properly. I cooked it in a pan on stove, after taking it out from the oven 
My girlfriend couldn't be more excited that I found her a pink coffee mug. It seals real well, and the insulation is great. It is too tall for her cup holder, but at least it doesn't spill when it falls over. One major warning: Don't put this in the dishwasher, or let it "soak" in hot water. Just fill with warm soapy water and sponge clean the outside. Otherwise, the air seal around the mug sucks in the water and holds onto it when you go to fill it with hot coffee. Then the water all squirts out on your counter. Honestly, if it wasn't pink, I would steal this from my girlfriend when she wasn't looking. There is a blue and red one out there for $5-$7 more 
The lodge is a very heavy skillet. It is almost 15" on the inside and requires a large burner for heating. Howver, it does cook very evenly. Clean up is simple, just make sure you have a large enough space for storage 
This pan lives up to the high quality I've come to expect from Lodge. 
I am absolutely sold on cast iron. I have 4 different size skillets plus covered casserole, fryer, dutch oven. I really enjoy using this giant one (pick your size for your crowd). I pre-heat it in a 350 degree oven for stove top cooking. I bake coffee cakes, corn bread and fritta's in it. It's roomy for grilling sandwiches. I have also broiled and "oven fried" meats in this skillet. I love to bake one pot meals (casseroles from cheese to rice)in the dutch ovens. Wet roasting is nice too but the pots do need to be re-reasoned after. I agree with two other reviews 1) clean up while still hot on the burner 2) no tomatoes! (acidic foods destroy the seasoned coating). Making gravy in these pans really cleans them up. I will never "need" to buy another set of cookware! 
This skillet was purchased to use outdoors with butane heat. Excellent heat retention and distribution allows even cooking and browning. Being over 15" in diameter, it will also fit across two electric cooktop elements on the range inside. Using both heating elements also allows for even cooking inside 
The only thing it lacks is a lid. Lodge seems to make a lid for everything but this pan 
I purchased this item based on other reviews and I am not sorry I made the purchase for several reasons. I love Lodge Cast Iron, Amazon has the best prices anywhere and free shipping. However, I was taken aback by the size of this skillet. It is huge! I tried it on my gas range and it takes up the front and the back burners but adjustments are needed to keep the sides from burning. If it is used on just the front burner (the larger burner) the flame is directed to the middle of the pan but there is so much skillet left over that the outer edges never get really hot. I would think the 13inch skillet (which I just purchased also) would make a more reasonable purchase becuase it is between a 12 which might be too small and the 15 1/4 which is toooooo big 
We've had our skillet a few months and now the nonstick coating is peeling off like crazy. What a waste of money and natural resources. It also makes me concerned about toxic substances that we might have been ingesting all this time. Terrible product. They really should offer a recall. It's a good design idea. They should offer it with a cast iron pan 
This is hands down the worst electric skillet that I have ever used. I noticed after the first time I used it that the non-stick coating was flaking off. I thought surely it was just a fluke so I used it two more times and every time I used it after that, I had to throw my food away because the coating flaked off into my food. Absolutely horrific 
Buying two of these. Yes, indeed. I'm the biggest loser of all. I was so impressed with how this looked and the write-up, I bought two of them. They are equally horrible. One lost it's non-stick properties after the second use and the other became "all-stick" after the third use. Do not waste your money on these things. There are cheaper and better skillets available. If you really want one despite all these reviews, please e-mail me and I will sell them to you really cheaply 
Don't bother with this skillet,the non-stick coating is non-existant. After a couple of uses the coating starts to come off and you know it's coming off on your food. Good idea from Rival (removable pan) but terrible product and a waste of hard earned money 
Rival, Do yourself a favor a take this electric skillet off the market asap! You should offer a $50 rebate coupon for every poor soul who purchased your junk product - starting with me. After 5 uses, the heating element stopped working and could not be fixed. Before it broke, the non-stick surface ended up with several of our meals. You guys ever heard of a six-sigma program? I will not buy any of your products again! 
This was the worst product I have ever purchased. After two times using the skillet and once in the dishwasher, the nonstick coating already peeled off of the bottom. It went in the trash. I would not waste my money on this product 
I have used electric skillets for years and years. I was so excited to get this new one because I thought the removeable pan would be a huge plus. That idea was a huge plus BUT the pan itself was absolutely awful. Everything and I mean everything sticks to this surface. You can actually see while scrubbing lightly that the coating just comes right off. Although that being said...it's no great loss because it didn't work anyways. I definitely would NOT recommend this!!! 
Like the other reviewers, I was impressed by this skillet...until I used it! This should be taken off the market so no one else has to waste their time! How this passed any tests is beyond me! It does heat unevenly, sticks, etc... e.g., to cook bacon, one should start with cold skillet, but for this skillet you are supposed to heat the skillet for 15 min. with the lid on first! Even holding heat is unpredictable. It is just terrible! They should be ashamed, and really, Amazon should not carry this except for the fact that we can warn others about it via this form 
This Farberware Millennium Soft-Touch SS set, which I received as a gift this past Christmas, has totally won my heart over and I would not hesitate to buy more from this series or even buy these as gifts for others. I've been using my set nearly every day since January and they have made me a very happy woman in the kitchen. For one, this attractively designed set has stayed nearly as pretty as the day I unpacked them from their box. Thanks to the smart lip design around the rims, liquids don't haphazardly drip down the sides, burn, and stain the pots or pans. (This also makes them easier to keep clean.) I've also received compliments on how attractive my cookware set is. I like that! Two, the soft-touch handles work great. Not only is it easier on the hands, they also make it easy to handle your cookware without potholders every single time. Yes, they do grow very warm and uncomfortable at times, but nothing that I've experience that can cause injury. Now, I haven't used my pans in the oven - so I cannot speak for that type of scenario - but for my every day gas stove top uses, they've kept their cool. Three, they cook GREAT!!! I've never been a fan of stainless steel in the past, but that's all changed now that I have this Farberware set. This set works efficiently enough to avoid having to use high heat all the time. I get better results working with lower heats now. It took a bit of a re-learning curve with my cooking initially, but once I got the gist of it, I had no problems working with stainless steel (SS) and my meals come out to my expectations. Four, easy cleanup. I used to believe that SS was such a pain to keep clean. But, once I learned to cook properly with SS, cleanup is not such a hassle that I thought it would be. Also, this cookware set easily cleans up in the dishwasher and it doesn't ruin their external appearance. I've also hand washed my Farberware Millennium pots and pans plenty of times without much effort. They truly clean up quite easily, BUT with one exception - EGGS!! Ugh! I'm sticking to non-stick Teflon pans for those. While I do love my Farberware Millennium set, it doesn't 100% fit all my needs so I do have a select few other pots and pans I've kept from my old collection of cookware. Like I mentioned before, I keep a small teflon-coated skillet for cooking eggs. I also keep a couple of wide-mouthed saucepans to accommodate my steamer. (The narrow design of the Farberware set keeps me from using the smaller saucepans for that purpose.) And what kitchen would be complete without a set of cast-iron skillets? But, for the most part, my SS Millennium set is my main workhorse cookware set that I use nearly every day with pleasure. Who knew that one didn't have to spend $$$ to have a great cookware set that acts like you spent $$$? I originally planned on getting another high end set, but now that I have my Farberware set I truly don't feel that I need to look any further for my cookware needs. I will gladly buy more from this series if need be. I'm very, very pleased. What prompted me to finally write a review for my 10 pc. Farberware Millennium soft touch stainless steel set? I recently finished hand washing my smaller SS skillet and was tickled to see it looking so great after so many uses. I just had to sing it's praises on Amazon 
I bought my Farberware Millenium set nearly 2 years ago. They clean up really well and look pretty much like the day I got them. No problems with the dishwasher at all! The silicon grips are my favorite feature (aside from being stainless steel). They make it so much easier to cook and not have to grab pot holders all the time. I'm a person that is clumsy with hot pots, so this was perfect. The handles are really sturdy too. I grew up in a home with the Farberware classic series and the plastic handles on those would always come loose and have to be tightened w/ a screwdriver. This hasn't been the case with the Millenium. I really would like to buy some more to expand my set in the future. These were an amazing price for what I got. Highly recommended 
I was very pleased with the 10 piece cookware set. It really heats evenly and cleans up easily 
Decided to buy new pans for me and give old set to my daughter going away to college. I did a lot of research before purchasing...Amazon had the best price and free shipping! I wanted stainless steel lids as opposed to glass ones so that was a plus for this set. The silicone covered handles are wonderful. This is a heavy duty set and cooks and cleans up beautifully. The only change I would make is to substitute a 12 inch skillet for the two smaller ones this set contains. 
I have owned a variety of cookware from cast-iron skillets to fancy-name porcelain pots. Almost all have frustrated me to some extent, but to be fair, I am not a "light-handed" chef in the kitchen. I thought long and hard about how to get the best value for replacements out of a limited budget. I dreamed of big-dollar brands made from stainless or copper, but I had to be reasonable. One day in desperate need for a new Teflon skillet, I noticed a Farberware Millennium non-stick on sale at a local shop, and I liked the feel of it. I took it home and liked it enough to buy an omelet pan a few weeks later. A year-plus on, I needed a more comprehensive rennovation of my cookware, and my experience and research led me to this stainless Millenium set. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The feel is substantial but not too heavy for slinging around the kitchen. Soft-Touch eases the burden, too. It heats extremely well -- quickly and evenly -- on my electric stove. I handwash the new set, but even my Teflon Millennium pans look pretty darned good after repeated dishwasher cycles in hard water. For new and experienced cooks on a budget, I strongly recommend the Millennium stainless 
I have had these pots and pans for over a year now and am still very pleased with their performance. I did have to learn to cook differently when using stainless steel with encapsulated bottoms. People need to understand that hard water will cause discoloration on stainless, but using Barkeepers Friend will remove any marks. I love the soft handles and never have to worry about them being hot. Highly recommend these pots and pans 
These are the worst pans I have ever used. They discolored after the first use. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with an SOS pad if you want to maintain the color. Wearever stainless is a far better option 
I ordered Millinnium Soft Touch Stainless on a Saturday, it arrived the following Thursday.It is beautiful,perfect weight and love the heat proof handles and lids. Had to try it out, so I fried a hamburger, then put the pan in warm soapy water and let it soak, came clean without any elbow grease. I did some research on several brands,including All Clad(too expensive)Cuisinart and Costco's Kirkland. Farberware is just as good as far as composition. My son is a professional chef and he recommended Farberware to me. I did need to adjust my cooking temperature, only medium and low. I have a ceramic cook top and the cookware works fine on it. I am very pleased, I only wish there would have been a larger skillet, 10 inches is a little small. Other than that I would recommend this cookware to anyone. It has a life time guarantee and the price is great. 
Ordered almost a month ago. Never been shipped and it will take another month for them to potentially ship this. Geez, I could have just bought this in the store for the exact same price. Rip off 
A 10" pan is my preferred size when I am just cooking for my wife and myself, and this All-Clad LTD pan is phenomenal. I have never used a better (or more expensive!) pan. I have given it five stars because it was a gift and I didn't have to pay for it -- if I had the rating may have suffered, since for that price it should probably make coffee and take out the trash as well. A couple notes: 1) If you maintain the surface consistently it is as easy to clean as non-stick. I like to use Bar Keeper's Friend. 2) It requires a few minutes' pre-heating -- if you are used to thinner pans, you will need to give it some extra time. 3) This pan cooks more evenly than I thought was actually possible - you don't even realize how uneven your old pans are until you try one of these. 4) I wanted the LTD for its "rugged good looks" - the other All-Clad pans perform basically the same, so if you don't like the dark exterior, go for one of those 
When choosing this pan I was a bit concerned that it might tip over easily or do not heat well at the edges, but it turned out to be simply fantastic. Even on the cheap electric stove from hell that's installed in our apartment this pan keeps perfectly heated and balanced. The size is enough for exactly 4 slices of bread, which means now I can make french toast or grilled cheese sandwich twice faster than on a round pan and save time and electricity 
We have AllClad LTD but when our old electric griddle died, we picked up one of these. It's such a luxury to have flip food so easily compared to a regular fry pan - I actually look for excuses to make eggs, pancakes, grilled cheese, etc. on this griddle 
This is a great pan easy to wash. You can practically wipe it clean with a dry paper towel. It is extremely durable. I have about twenty-five pieces of All-Clad LTD in my collection. This is my first piece of non-stick to add to my collection. My husband is a chef-instructor and he LOVES these pans. I would take All-Clad's advice and only preheat pan to medium heat. It is a quality piece and distributes heat fast and thoroughly. The pan only cost 49.99 with free shipping thru Amazon. What a DEAL. Other's had it priced between $50 - $120 plus shipping. Also shipping only took about five days when they said it would take 10 - 14 days. 
My son recommended this griddle as he had purchased one and liked it. I am satified 
I have never written a review for anything before but just had to for this great griddle. Everytime I get it out I comment to my husband how much I love it! This is perfect if you make pancakes, eggs, french toast or grilled cheese as much as I do. Nothing sticks to it and it is an absolute breeze to clean 
For the single household, I think is a wonderful griddle pan perfect for making French toast, grilled cheese and tuna melt sandwiches, cheese quesadillas and pancakes. The heat from a gas range transfers through the pan quickly and pretty evenly. The non-stick surface is a breeze to clean, and the handle is sturdy. I don't use it for any dish that requires a greater amount of oil or butter because of the low lip, but that's fine by me. At 11 square inches, it's too small to use for parties, but on the other hand, it is easier to carry and store unlike the family-size 20 by 13-inch Grande Griddle. I am amazed how often I use it simply for the convenience. As it is All-Clad, this is a highly recommended piece of cookware to add to your collection 
Great pan! It makes cooking fun again! Super non-stick and very heavy duty. Lifetime warranty but I don't think I'll be needing it for a long time. The only thing I don't like is that the sides are too short 
This Axis ice bucket will last forever. It is top quality and the right size for the real world 
The box that my tree came in was falling apart so I needed a new way to store it for the next season. I originally saw a christmas tree storage bag on another website and I think it was advertised for $15, but when I went back to get it it was gone (thank goodness) and I searched on Amazon and ended up finding this bag at a much better price. The bag is huge. My tree is only 7 feet tall and there is a ton of room left over in the bag. Not to mention the handles on the bag make it super easy to move around. I am a small woman 5' 4", and I had no problem picking up the bag to move it to storage, when usually I have to have my husband do all that. I would definitley get this bag if you are looking for one 
It is bulky and akward to transport. Will not hold up for years to come. I knew this getting into it. You can tell by the photo that it's cheap plastic material. Good as a "for now" fix 
I use my bags to store all the linens and things we remove from our boat when we put it into winter storage. It keeps everything together, dry and dust free. I'm buying 3 more to use when we move my daughter out of her college dorm. A lot more versatile than plastic bins 
This tree bag will fit a tree or two- if you have two! Very roomy I still have alot of room to fill in mine. Seems to be a pretty good bag that will hold up as long as you don't drag it because it's too heavy once you fill it! 
We recently purchased this to store an 8 foot Christmas tree. The material is heavyweight "tarp" type material, and seems adequate. The handles are well sticked on and the opening is wide enough to make getting the tree in and out easy. Overall what we expected 
We ordered 2 of these so we could store our tree pieces across a couple of bags and make storage/retrieval easier. Great product 
It was a lot bigger than I anticipated but it works just like it should 
At less than $5, you don't get much but what you get works.... - Look at dimensions. 60" long. It won't fit a 5' tree or larger tree since the bag is only 5' and the zipper takes another foot away due to it's side entry vs being at an end. Buy 2 and store your tree in two bags. It worked for me only after I had to cut the bag a little more to fit the bottom 2 sections to my tree... 
This storage bag is everything I expected, and at a great price. It is sturdy and protects the tree. I was orginally going to store the tree in the box supplied, but was unable to keep it closed and it was ripping. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a cloth bag and was trying to figure out what separated the others based on features and price points - nothing stood out and decided on the lowest price. The quality is good, although I would recommend taking care loading the tree and moving the loaded bag - it isn't cloth. Another advantage would be because it is not cloth, the bag is easily wiped down (dust build up, etc.) 
The storage bag was too small despite saying it fit up to a 7 1/2 ft. artificial tree. 
I have had to replace this carafe four times in one year. If you accidently tap the carafe even lightly, the whole thing cracks! I can't stand this carafe, but after spending $100 on the coffeemaker, I'm stuck with it for a little while 
It needs to be further specified which models this fits. Not mine 
This carafe DOES NOT fit DCC-1000 despite the website's claim that it fits Cuisinart 12-cup coffeemakers. It may fit other models, but definitely does not fit the DCC-1000 
No matter how many times this pitcher was washed, it still kept making the drinks taste like plastic. After trying various types of liquids, and always drinking exclusively out of real glass glasses, I finally tossed the pitcher because it kept ruining every drink with that awful plastic stink and taste. Only high-grade plastic won't transfer taste and odor. It's surprising to see a good company like Rubbermaid would use low-grade plastic for a pitcher of all things. 
I've got two little ones, a 2 year old boy, and a 3 year old girl. My first worry after reading many of the reviews was that most who seemed to be having success had cats under a year old. Well I'm about 3 weeks in, and so far they are adapting nicely. The instructions in the kit stated to put the litterbox by the toilet for a week, then just take it away and put the Citikitty kit on the toilet. Well after a day of some panicked looks and panicked meowing, I decided to take a step back. I put the thing on the floor and started raising it a few inches every few days. I'm happy to say that we just graduated to putting it straight on the toilet! I'm taking much longer than the kit recommends at each step, as I am very determined to make this work, so I'm sure they appreciate that as well. Downside: My bathroom has never looked worse...there is litter flung and tracked EVERYWHERE. But I would go through that for a year if I had to in order to ensure the next 15 years would be litter free! Another downside is, as others have stated, there is no going back in steps ones the holes are punched. I think I will be cutting my own much more gradually than the perforated ones. I think the holepunching process is what will make or break this deal! But as I said, I'll go as slow as I have to. I'll check back in a few weeks with an update 
We live in New York City and have two cats - younger cats, 18 months and about a year old - needless to say, it would be really nice if we could rid ourselves of the litter box forever. We had originally purchased a cat toilet-training system from another company - it was not nearly as good as this one, in fact, it was a total failure - flimsy plastic, and you couldn't punch out the insert gradually like you can this one. At this point we are almost there - we have punched out about half of the insert, and the cats are acually perching on the toilet seat and aiming for the hole - just incredible. We are very happy! The plastic is strong and easy to clean - 
Sturdy plastic handles my 12 lb. cat easily. Not for someone who isn't ready to do the training steps. You will have to share the bathroom with the cat, move the CityKitty every time YOU need to use the toilet; clean up "misses" that catch the seat; and, keep the seat down and lid up. To make the transition, we started by putting her self scooping litter box on a platform next to toilet. Then, we moved her litter to the CityKitty. We also used about and inch of litter so we didn't scare her. As the first week progressed, (no holes punched) we transitioned to the flushable litter. Having two bathrooms is a plus. We just opened the first hole ONLY in 1. This way, if she protests, she has an acceptable option. Suggest a container of those ready-to -use disinfecting wipes. Sometimes, she "misses" and catches the seat. She also still likes to bury and gets litter on seat and tracks it around floor. The little swiffer vac is getting a lot of use. However, anyone with a litter box already has to deal with tracked litter. I keep reminding myself it will be worth it in the end. 
We have two little monsters and found out quickly that it is best to separate the two during training. It is a good thing we have two bathrooms. If you have multiple cats another thing you might consider is that it can be much easier once your kittens are spayed or neutered. We started with a LitterKwitter. The Litter Kwitter costs more but has insert rings with variable sized holes that are switched as your cat progresses. This makes it reusable and gives you the ability to back up if your cat is not ready for the next stage. The Citikity has break-out rings. Once you go to a stage there is no going back and when your cat is trained you throw the Citikitty away. However, you can break out 1/2 stages making it possible to make the initial step from full pan to pan with a hole in it less tramatic. That is one drawback with the LitterKwitter. The first stage with a hole was a BIG jump for our cats. 4 stars because: #1 it is not reuseable and #2 I think the $29.99 price tag is a bit steep for a toilet seat sized piece of relativly thin plastic. Drop that price to $19.99 and it would get my 5 stars. Because you can breakout 1/2 stages I would choose this over the LitterKwitter 
You can buy a better product at an all-for-a-dollar store. This is a complete rip-off for naive cat owners. Please don't waste your money! You can do much better with a large bowl. 
I have 2 cats and they are 8 months now. I started them on the citty kitty about 2 months prior and so far its great. I was fortunate to have already placed their litter boxes in the bathroom so drawing them from that to the toilet was easy. For my cats it seems they follow the litter. They also love to [...] on fresh litter especially after I cleaned and replaced it =-). I bought 2 training cats for the 2 toilets I have in my house and they use both of them well. Once I placed the kits on the toilets and poured fresh litter on it they were ready to use it. I am on the last 3 rings and am confident they will have no problems. It looks like now they are working their aim (into the actual toilet) and scraping as much litter in the hole. The only thing I suggest is if your cat likes a clean litter ensure you clean the kit daily. My male cat got pist one time and pee'd in the corner of the bathroom. Thats the only time any of them made "mistakes". Punching holes can be a mess too. Suggest getting disposable gloves. Also sometimes your cat may miss or splatter or what have you. I bought a bunch of those cleaning wipes for the bathroom so that before anyone uses the toilet they can wipe off any excess litter or splashes and toss it in the toilet. Lastly learn your kitty's bathroom routine. Last thing you need is both of you showing up at the bathroom ready to go 
This is one of the best investments I have made for the kitchen. With this pan, you can make seared scallops so tender and succelent, it will make you feel like a professional chef. I also grill vegetables of all kinds on this pan with a little bit of olive oil for a delicious and low-fat side or main dish. You will not be disappointed 
What a great deal this was. The grill pan was less than half price and the two All-Clad oven mitts are a terrific bonus. Macy's shipped this almost immediately and it arrive very quickly 
The Whirley-Pop Stovetop popcorn popper is incredible. The popcorn is the best tasting ever! I use 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a half cup of popocorn and this popper pops every kernel in just a few minutes time on the stove. The crank on the popper is a little squeaky, but like I said the popcorn is awesome. After using the popper it is very easy to clean, I just wipe it out with a paper towel and then put it back in storage. I would highly recommend this popper to anyone who is a popcorn lover 
I use my Whirley Pop every day. I bought a 50 lb bag of popcorn from Sams as my niece suggested. I go to Weight Watchers so this method of making popcorn works very well for my diet. The popcorn tastes so much better than air-popped 
This is the best popcorn popper ever! It's easy, really fast and fun. Every kernel pops up light and fluffy. We used the pre-measured movie theater packs and we think the popcorn tastes better than what we get at the movies. We also popped a store bought corn and it also popped up light and fluffy with no kernels unpopped. We are not fans of microwave popcorn and we usually popped in a pot on the stove. The Whirley-pop makes a better popcorn and is so much faster and easier because of the material it is made of and the way the steam is vented. We love it and never have a problem eating the full batch. 
I absolutely love this popper. It makes the best popcorn I have ever eaten. And the flavor is just like Theatre popcorn. It is easy to use and pops up the corn very fast and is easy to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes popcorn. I will never go back to microwave popcorn again!!! 
Requires a lot of turning on the handle, but worth it for that old fashioned movie type popcorn! I recommend for family fun 
Good quality pans; however, if you want a crispy bottom, you won't get it unless you take the pizza off the pan and place directly on the oven rack. Good for pre-baking homemade crusts though. 
I have three sizes of these skillets. I love all of them. You cook without oil. The clean up is great. Every thing is cooked on med to low heat. They are wounderful. I would tell anyone to buy them 
We know have 2 10 inch Analon Titanium skillets. We like them all very much. We had some earlier analon skillets and they are very good, but the titanium series is better. An earlier Anolon skillet still is non-stick but is starting to lose something. The titanium does not seem to be losing it. Great skillets 
Heats super evenly, non-stick works fantastic, dishwasher safe as long as you use the right detergent. It doesn't get any better than that 
I first discovered Analon Titanium (restaurant tested) fry pans in Macy's. They only had an 8 inch model, which I purchased as it is perfect for making a personal omelet. They are heavy gauge aluminum clad in titanium on the bottom and have completely steel handles unlike the lower grade of Analon which look very similar but have silicone rubber handle grips. As such, the metal handles are much better for popping a meal into the oven after initially frying/browning it on the stove. The nonstick coating is very high grade as well 
I just love my analon titanium. Cooks evenly, goes in the oven, excellent nonstick, and has the world's most comfortable handles. If you're like me, all-clad handles dig into your hands painfully. These handles nestle stably in your palms 
The knife set is absolutely fantastic! The knives are razor sharps, feel great in the hand, and ring like a tuning fork when sharpened. They look, feel and cut like quality. They hold an edge far longer than I expected, staying sharp for weeks between honing on the sharpening steel. They are a little heavy in the hand, but very well balanced. I highly recommend them. The best knives I've ever owned 
I really am truly satisfied with this product. The dimmension where it set up is different at top and bottom due to the base boards. The gate can adjust for this and is just as secure. I also like the fact that I found less expensive then ordering it from the manufacturer 
Between basset hounds and babies we have had too many pet/baby gates to count. Not only was this gate easy to install, but it is also incredibly sturdy. This gate has been working marvelously for over a year and we are now replacing all of our pet gates with this model. This is definitely the gate to have 
The Richell 94118 One-Touch Adjustable Pet Gate with Wood Finish is awesome. I'm so glad I paid the extra money. The gate is actually wood and metal. It is sturdy and relatively easy to assemble. The gate swings both ways and is easy to open and close 
Good gate and the wood finish looks well with house decor. Easy to use with one hand. A little hard to install in doorway and the piece at the bottom can cause a tripping hazard. Would be better if the bottom rail was lower profile or if the bottom was wider and angled on both sides as a ramp so that you don't trip over it. We have all hit our toes and tripped going through this door. You will trip or hit your foot if you do not go slow and raise your feet 
Worth every penny, it is truly a beautiful pet gate with class. Goes well with wood floors and you cannot purchase this in a pet store. Wonderful price and free shipping. I will definitely purchase more things from Amazon 
Loved the look of this gate on-line. Even nicer in person. When people walk in, they say, "What a beautiful gate". It matches all of our woodwork and nobody can believe it isn't screwed into the doorframe. Very sturdy. Excellent value. If I ever had to purchase another gate, I wouldn't even consider any other kind 
I highly recommend this gate. It looks great. You can see ours from our front door and we get compliments on it all of the time. The door also swings very smoothly. It is also easy enough for the kids to close properly, as we have had other gates in the past that were difficult to close 
I love this gate, it is really good looking and doesn't take away from my decor. I highly recommend it! 
It's a great-looking gate for the money. It also functions very well and is adjustable. Just be sure that you measure your doorway and put it together using the correct hardware configuration for your doorway's size 
I've had this for almost 2 years, and it's a great little "crockpot". I've put several dips in this over the time I've owned it, and the only hassle is the cleanup. As mentioned in another review, the unit is one piece, so you can't submerse it in water. Other than that, I love having this for holiday entertaining, when I only want to keep a small amount of a dip constantly warm. (Although I believe it's $12.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond 
it's unfortunate it's no longer heaiting after a year. i was taking a good care of it, so i'm sad. it seems half of the body is warm but the opposit side stay the room tempreture, it's not good. for this price, i guess i have to give it up 
The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that you can NOT take out the pot. You also cannot immerse this in water, so cleaning is a giant pain. That said, it's GREAT for dips that need to be kept warm, such as my famous 'chile con queso'. Just put everything together and plug it in. A few hours before a party, cut a 4" block of Velveeta into 1" cubes, put in the Lil' Dipper. Add a few tablespoons of medium Pace Picante. Add 1/3 of a small can of chopped green chiles. For more spice, dribble in the juice from a jar of jalapenos. To thin it out, you can add cream, half and half, or milk. Or even water (but that will dull the taste). Serve with your favorite torilla chips. You can also make this in the microwave if you need to make something 'in a hurry'. I wouldn't recommend putting this on a dining table, as you'd need an extension cord, and kids could trip over it and burn themselves (heck, I guess at some parties, adults could, too!) but a buffet or counter against the wall would be fine. 
Great for fondue- heat coming from the bottom and sides of the crock does a better job of keeping dips warm than a pot with the heat source on the bottom only. Compact so that it doesn't take up too much space on the table. Needs a few minutes to warm up and you might need an extension cord in order to have it on the table 
My wife - Japanese - was pissed when I ordered this. She thought a stone would work best. She was very surprised and happy after trying it, however. It's a fine sharpener and easy to use. Price is right. Recommended 
I got this a couple of days ago because my chef's knife was starting to squash tomatoes rather than cut through them. Sharpening both the chef's and a vegetable knife, following the directions, I was pleasantly surprised when they each sliced through the paper towels I was using to dry them off. I finished the sharpening with a steel and am very happy with the results. I haven't done anything to the blades but use the steel after each use since I bought the knives, and am jazzed that this little guy brought my blades back to life. I know there was some negative reviews of the blades, but keeping the blades perpendicular, and not pushing down to hard, I got a good edge. I think if you push down too hard, you put the blade edge flat on the wheel, and grind off the edge, which would make the knife duller. Keep it perpendicular so it puts wheels faces against the blades faces and it will give you what you are looking for. But of course, a professional sharpening from someone who has been doing this type of thing for years would produce an amazing edge - probably for about the same cost as this little baby 
Does not sharpen particularly well. Furthermore, the cheap, flimsy plastic cover constantly comes off when you drag the knife through. Definitely not recommended 
I read the reviews below and saw that there were a few bad ones and then mostly positive one. I decided to give this sharpener a try. When I got it one of the wheels wasn't on its tracks and so I just popped it into place filled the sharpener with water and directed and started sharpening my knives. It has made my two Global's Razor sharp and another knife almost as sharp. I decided to give them the real test and took them to work (Sushi Chef). They worked so well, sliced through everything. I think for anyone that needs a fast effective sharpening tool this is a good choice. 
What are other people are doing to their Globals with this sharpener? Mine works extremely well and makes my G2 very sharp in a matter of a few minutes. Trust me, I am as bad a knife sharpener as anyone could be. In fact, this sharpener is part of the reason I bought my Global in the first place. I can only guess that using a light, even stroke and making sure that the knife is straight up and down in the sharpening slots is important to the sharpening technique. Also, the sharpener doesn't work on many non-global knives because of the weird bevel Global edges have so don't think it's going to work on your Wustof unless you have a professional re-cut the bevel to a Global-style. Buy one, follow the directions and you and your Globals will be very happy. 
I'm not sure how people are banging up their knives using this simple, effective sharpener. Slow down, folks. Take your time. I own a number of Global knives, and sharpen them all using the MinoSharp with tremendous success. I've even had luck sharpening Henckel and Wusthof knives with this. I enjoy using it, and when I'm done, my knives are like new 
I gave this a super bad rating a few months ago - something to the effect of "avoid avoid avoid...at all cost" - which upon review seemed a tad over-the-top. The things is, as others have reported, this device will take a sharp knife and make it dull. I've never been able to get it to do anything other than leave unsightly scrapes down the length of the blade. You're better off saving your money for a good steel, which is the only way I've ever been able to keep a Global knife sharp. 
I've only had the product for a short time but it's definitely making a noticeable change on the edge of my Global knives. I'm rather impressed. 
This was a very nice knife sharpener. It was easy to use and it provided a very nice sharpness to the blade. Main points: easy to use, provides an effective sharp blade within a few minutes 
My cat absolutely loves this!!!!!!!!! She was glued to the TV the entire run time of the DVD. YOU MUST TRY THIS DV 
Our cat was mesmerized by this video. At the very beginning, she didn't pay much attention, but then the video showed a cardinal, and her ears perked up and her eyes grew big as saucers! She was hooked! Mostly she sat in front of the TV with her eyes glued to the screen! About five times she actually tried to climb up to the TV! She will enjoy this.... and we shall enjoy watching her 
My cat loves this DVD, just don't use with a flat panel unless it's behind glass as your cat may attack the screen 
I like it. The shaped tongs help in gripping heavier things, as opposed to a smooth tong end. It was worth the purchase 
These are the tongs every cook and/or bbqer needs. They are chef quality. Throw away all the others that don't really "grab" anything and slide from side to side. From picking up a thick steak or one thin spear of aspargus, this is a tool you need 
I highly recommend it. I've never had any problems with it. Measurements are accurate, there is really no need to put it in the microwave, and if the product inside is too hot, you can use oven mitts. A very practical, durable and sturdy kitchen tool. 
This excellent kitchen tool has metric conversions right next to the US measurements, which makes it a perfect item for the international gourmet/chef. Very affordable, and durable, its shape makes it really easy to hold and handle with bare hands. Using a real stove to heat your liquids in a pan (the good old fashioned way) eliminates any "risks" of getting scalded... 
I was first attracted to this interesting measuring cup by the unusual shape. Once I tried to use it, however, it was a really worthless measuring cup. I suggest that you not buy it. It has a tall, slender shape that is top-heavy and easy to knock over, even if you are being careful. It has weight markings for sugar and flour, but trying to measure dry ingredients in a liquid measuring cup is very inaccurate, so these markings are worthless. The label claims to be microwave safe, but it is made from polycarbonate and I have melted similar items in my microwave before. I do not plan to test the microwave safety of this cup. Since it does not have a handle, once you fill it with hot liquid you cannot pick it up with your bear hands. All in all, a badly designed product that you should avoid. 
Item arrrived on ahead of time and in good conditions at a great low price 
Roomy, sturdy, well made and attractive. I am very pleased with this item. It exactly matches my Ocean Breeze place settings 
i love these canisters, the best i have ever owne 
I love this set. It will look lovely as a decorator piece on my counter tops 
This little chopper does wonders. It chops nuts and veggies like a much bigger chopper. It's super sturdy. I keep all of my walnuts etc. in the freezer to keep them fresh and this chopper chops the frozen nuts wonderfully. I was leary at first, hanging on to my old crank nut chopper handed down from my husbands mother. It didn't take me long to toss the old one away. I just love this chopper and use it for all my cooking needs. A wonderful purchase at a wonderful price 
I purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms. She finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck 
I should know.......... I have bought it twice now! I started off buying the cheap ones....... but they are ugly I walked out of the room while heating water by the time I came back it was completely stuck to the burner. (my fault) I then decided to buy a NICE tea kettle bought the Le Creuset larger one . REALLY loved it but it was just SO big. I seem to be the only one who makes tea so I didn't need the big one. The 1 1/4 quart demi kettle is teh right size for one to two people. And you can have several cups of tea from it. I use it to heat up water add it to the coffee grinds in my coffee press. I FINALLY bought this one LOVE IT!! It's perfect for me looks nice on the stove when not in use. I did have to buy another when I burned THIS one on the stove as well....... It didn't melt away on the stove but the enamel did start to chip...... But I LOVED this one SO MUCH that I immediately set out to find the exact same one. I abslutely love it. And I am being much more careful to not leave the room when I have the stove on. :) I am a firemans nightmare. 
I followed all instructions and these bulbs did not grow. Even with proper llighting and water temperature I had no success. The company, however, does offer a great guarantee, but I did not pursue this 
As long as you have the proper lighting, these bulbs will flourish. Mine have grown beautifully and they were all different kinds - some purple, some green, with very different leaves. One of them even had small white flowers. It's so much cheaper than buying pre-grown plants and also, you won't get snails or other unwanted pests accidentally. I have goldfish in my tank so I grew these in a partitioned-off area so they won't eat them completely on me. They grew fine in an aquarium at room temperature 
I love these things! Within 2 to 4 days after placing these into my aquarium, most of the bulbs had started growing roots. After planting in the gravel as instructed, they began sprouting leaves. There were different plant varieties in my package. They grow very fast and look great. I use a fluorescent bulb on a timer for 9 hours/day 
This is a wonderful, inexpensive little space heater that functions perfectly for my needs (over-airconditioned office). It's unfortunate that this item has received so many poor reviews--but I feel that's mainly the result of operator error. The timer function seems to be stumping quite a few people. If you purchase this heater and have trouble after reading the enclosed instructions, simply read the review, "Things you should know before buying" from November 4, 2006-- everything is explained very clearly 
I bought this for my daughters bedroom that has no heating at all. I live in NY and it has been extreemly cold this winter. It keeps her room VERY warm. A great little heater 
The heater does not give off the heat I thought it would. You have to be sitting right next to it to really get any warmth from it. It does not have an element that radiates heat so there isn't a lot of heat for the fan to send out. I would honestly recommend spending a little more and going for a larger unit. I did like the on and off timer feature though and the fact that it turns off if knocked over. 
I love this heater. It has several safety and convenience features. I actually couldn't figure out how to get it working though, a co-worker helped. The instructions weren't well written. However, there is an 800 number on the bottom for customer serice. I would strongly recommend. It's a great value. 
Like everyone else it seems the item I got was also defective and did not work. Only the rotation and nothing else. Not the fan, not the heater. BOO 
After using this heater for a few weeks, I've found it to be a good value and a good product. It distributes heat evenly through the area we need heated and has features that are quite easy to use. It was good choice 
Decided to buy the DeLonghi heater, as recommended by ConsumerReports. On being powered on, the unit oscillated but neither fan nor heater started up. I did make sure the 'safety trip' was not activated. This is located below the unit, designed to switch it off in case it toppled over. In short, I put in the effort, to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid, since the unit 'looked' fine - nothing obviously broken. A prior reviewer seems to have had similar problem, but thought Amazon's package handling might be the culprit. In my case, the packaging on arrival was excellent. Return procedure for Amazon was surprisingly smooth, they even refunded the shipping fee for sending it back. 
At first I thought it was great. The cat likes it and loves to watch it clear itself. Now the cat uses it to poo but not to pee. There is way!!! to much cat litter. When it cleans itself it trys to pulls half the cat litter into the SMALL cardboard tray. I still have to clean the box once a week which I guess is better than three times a day. I guess our cat poos a lot. The poo does get stuck in the prongs from time to time and that is your que to clean the tray out. I also don't like that the cat really shuffles the litter around before he goes so it sets the sensor off and we have to shake the box often or just push the button to get it to run. That is kind of anoying. I think they really need to make some adjustments to the box but if you have an older cat that doesn't dig a lot or poop a lot then this is the box for you. Be aware though you will most likely have to clean it every week. I had to actually flip the lid around so the cat would push the litter away from the tray. He was helping push the litter into the tray so it would fill up clean litter and the poop would get stuck in the grid. All in all it's not to bad! 
Excellent solution to eliminating/reducing the odor that occurs during the end-cycle of the cartridge. 
I love my cat but detested the cat box. After reading the reviews I bought this and it is the best buy of the year! No smell, my cat took to it right a way, After I ordered, I bought a box of the crystal litter and put it on top of her litter. By the time this box came in she was ready! No smell, and it last over the suggested 30 days. Almost makes me want to get another cat 
This is a wonderful product that saves so much time as far as cleaning out cat litter boxes on a very regular basis. As a person with a bad back and shoulders it is ideal. Our cats became used to it very quickly which was also a bonus. They seem entranced when the cleaning mechanism goes back and forth,which is funny to watch. I really would recommend this to owners. I have just realised i am giving an all around review which i am sorry for. The Hood is great for the privacy that people,cats,and everyone neeed 
We bought one for all three of the litter boxes we got. We were afraid that our kitties would not like the open boxes. They love the privacy the hoods offer and it also gives a finish look to the scoop free box. I urge anyone who buys the litter box to purchase the hood. 
This would work better if it was more secure on the litter box. It does a pretty good job keeping the litter in the box, but my cat is pretty spazzy and knocks it off pretty easily. Maybe I'm just not getting in on right though. Still, it's better than cleaning up all the litter he would spray everywhere without it 
Great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken. Amazon, how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn't pack them well enough for shipping? Amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an Amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go. Any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic. I've received two of those lovely surprises, the first set I ordered and the replacement set. Oh boy, I give up! The canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them. Just imagine the UPS guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard. THEY BREAK! Amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement (in this case) so it's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage. Are you feeling lucky??? If so then roll the dice 
My only complaint is that Amazon does not properly pack their products. It took 3 attempts to get them here with out any damage! The canisters are pretty and are able to hold a large amount of product 
The product shipped great. Only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned. The colors are great and the storage is good. 
These canisters were bought at a great price through Amazon, JCPenny wanted $70+. We waited a month for Amazon to ship them and then when we got them, the 2 big canisters were demolished in shipping. So we sent them back and asked for them to send us another box. We recieved these 4 days later and they too were cracked everywhere. So we asked them to ship a new box, and if they were broken then we'd go somewhere else. And sure enough the 3rd box was intact and is sitting on our counter top with sugars and flour in them 
Saw these canisters and fell in love with them. Couldn't wait to get them and when I did they were broken into a million pieces. They replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn't fit properly. Another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off. I was disppointed in the quality. I wouldn't buy these again even if I had to buy something more expensive 
I love the capability that can be transferred from a microwave to an oven. I use it primarily for my frozen crab cake that I microwave it first for couple minutes, then move it to an oven to finish cooking with crisp textures 
I have had the more well-known travel mugs, and thought that they were the best. Well, I was wrong. This travel mug is by far the best out there. It is truly leak-proof. My friends get tired of me turning it upside down (I guess I'm easily amused hehe), but I really do like a mug that won't spill if tipped over. When turned to the drink side, the liquid flows at about the right rate, not too fast, not too slow. Anyway, I can't say enough about this mug, and the price also beats the competition. I am not sure about the red color. I have the blue and the black, and I prefer the black out of the three choices 
I love this plate!! I am actually waitng for the other 10 that I recently ordered. My husband loves them becasue they are heavy duty and have a large eating space. Love the fact that they don't chip, and the paint does not wear off. Everyone that eats over my house comments on my dinnerware (all Fiesta). 
This plate isn't quite as big as I expected, but I love it! It is gorgeous and works well as a serving plate - I have used it for serving garlic bread and quesadillas (size is perfect for the big tortillas I usually buy) so far. I have the sunflower color and it is beautiful. I look forward to purchasing more Fiestaware! 
I have about 20 chop plates. I have most of the colors. I use them for barbeque dinners and for Italian meals. They will hold the whole meal on one plate (southern style). They have enough space to keep messy foods separated with no need for separate side plates. The standard dinner plates are too small. Stacked on open shelves with my other Fiestaware pieces they give a burst of color to my neutral kitchen. I started with my mother-in-law's collection that was passed down to me. The older plates are larger than the current style. With mixed colors you can set the table to any color theme. Warning! No one likes the pink one. It's "the tongue plate." The last person to the table gets that plate and it's not unusual to see it sneakily moved from place to place after the table is set. Kids love to switch it around. These plates are fun. Amazon has the best price on single plates. 
Just received my Cobalt Tones chop plate. It's beautiful. I plan to use it as a serving platter more than a plate. I saw this listed on Amazon last fall and put off ordering it. When I decided it was a "must have", it was out of stock. I tried other sites and couldn't find Cobalt tones anywhere. I contacted the company to find a retailer and was told that it was exclusive to Amazon! However, I have seen this pattern or something very close at Tamarak outside Beckley, WV. (It is a West Virginia sponsored open mall featuring crafts and products made in WV, which Fiesta is.) I was thrilled when it was back in stock. It will give my Fiesta table an even more creative look 
I love this plate, and it's good for serving something like roast chicken, but it's too big for everyday use, so it sits in my cupboard the rest of the time. Just know that this plate is BIG! If you do a lot of serving, it's probably good for you, but I only bring it out at Thanksgiving, holidays, and large dinners with friends 
This is a very versatile piece. It really brightens up the table. A must for fiesta Post86 collections. I have extras that I use as chargers underneath other colored plates 
They're pillowcases. They hold my pillows well. Good fabric and stitching. Comfortable 
they are a lovely color, but I don't like the fact they aren't zippered. They slip off constantly 
These pillowcases are very soft and comforting when you go to sleep. Yes, they are a little slick but I use them with flannel sheets and we have no problems with them falling off the bed. I have 8 pillows in these pillowcases and at the cheap price that they are, I purchased 4 more in case something happens to one of them. These are a great deal! 
This pillows are so incredably soft. I wished they had a zipper so they would not fall off(that would make them perfect). But they are still worth ever cent and more 
These pillow cases are great, nice color, nice material. When washed and dried they come out nice and smooth. I would liked for them to be a little bit longer, but the quality is great 
These pillow cases are so soft to sleep on. They're large enough to fit a king size pillow, so they're a little large for my standard size. Worth the money 
First of all the price was wonderful I was not expecting to purchase them for such a great price. They sleep very well and they are lovley against my decor 
These are very high quality of pillowcases. I got as many as I could and in all different colors and sizes, because I have twin, Queen and King size pillows at my house. I didn't worry about colors (white, wine, plum, light blue,taupe etc.). It really didn't matter what color case I put on, because with such a variety, it was easy too coordinate. But, nobody cares, because they are so soft and you can change them every day in the heat when everybody is sweaty at night, or for whatever reason it's dirty. They wash and dry just like new every time. Can't sleep better than with a fresh, clean, and soft pillowcase under your head at night. 
The plates arrived in good condition and are what I needed to complete my servic 
This set is a great addition to my kitchen. It's functional and adds a great red accent to the countertop, matching my other KitchenAid appliances. I highly reccommend it 
This KitchenAid 16pc cutlery set is a beautiful addition to my kitchen which is decorated using red and white appliances. The cutlery set includes a variety of different size knives- each perfect for chopping and slicing. Beauty and Function together 
It looks attractive, but I was markedly disappointed with the lack of sharpness in all the knives. I find myself reaching for an old set of knives to cut up vegetables. If the fruit or veggies are nearing ripeness, the kitchenaid knives will not cut through them at all 
I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the 10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products 
I ordered from Amazon, the KitchenAid KA1PR16N Cook's Series 16-piece Cutlery Set with Traditional Natural Block, Red Handles which is exactly the same as this set, but cheaper. The picture for the other set is wrong though because it shows polished handle ends for the steak knives, but the handles are red plastic only and the handle ends for the other pieces are actually brushed steel and not polished as shown in the picture. In essence, the knife set that is pictured here is the knife set that you will also get if you purchase the other KitchenAid knife set that I've mentioned above. As far as the knives themselves, the weight is perfect for chopping and the blades are nice and sharp. The funky red color looks cute in my kitchen too. The only negative is they're not dishwasher safe, but luckily they do clean easily by hand. Even though Amazon is having a hard time correctly picturing the KitchenAid knife sets, I'm very satisfied with the set that I received and thrilled to finally have a knife set to be proud of 
This with a doubt one of the worst can openers I've ever owned!! I bought it because it is attractive and will accept tall cans. It is attractive, but not very functional. It is so very difficult to get the can positioned just right, so it will open, that it takes 5 or 6 tries just to get it to work. The "lid catcher" blocks your view of the mechanism so it's almost impossible to position the can properly. In addition when removing the can, the cutting arm mechanism slides off the opener most of the time. Don't but this poorly designed product!! 
Hey, the thing opens cans. I am not that picky. As long as it works, I am happy 
Buy one, you and your cat will love it. Too good to be true. And the price is fantastic! 
I've gone through so many cat collars over the years. They either break, mat my cat's hair, or he scratches at them until I worry he'll hurt himself. Not with this one! As soon as it arrived, I slipped it over his head. He had no idea, and still doesn't. I'd all but given up getting him to wear his tags due to the problems with other collars. Now, thanks to this one, his tags are where they belong. I'm so happy that I'm thinking of ordering more to give them to all the cat lovers I know for Christmas stocking stuffers this year 
I bought three of these collars for my cats because we're moving and I want them to have IDs. In the past, I've tried the wider collars with the safety snap. When I put those on, the cats would wiggle and squirm trying to get the collar off and with the safety snap they eventually unlatched them. Plus, the width of other collars tends to mat the hair around their necks. This collar, so far, is far superior. Two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head, but once the Safety Collar was on, they haven't thought twice about it. They haven't tried to get them off or scratched at them, it doesn't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin, the fur on their necks aren't suffering. The sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use. The colors are very vibrant. I got Mango Orange, Maui Blue, and Tulip Red but unfortunately, since my cats have long hair the color gets lost in their fur. But that doesn't take anything away from how much I love these collars. If your not sure, these are inexpensive enough to give a try! If you need to put a collar on your cat, I think these are one of the best options available 
My brother and each got one as a gift about ten years ago. I currently have both of them. While they definately have some limitations, the asthetics and ease of use balance them out. Reasonably reliable: after 7 years of use and three years in a non-climate controlled crawl-space, the motor in one of them gave out. I am ordering a replacement as soon as the marineland website comes back online. If I were going to buy this myself, I would instead opt for a traditional setup of seperate glass aquarium, filter, and hood. You would get more for your money. However, if you want a sleek system that looks great and runs silent, this will be a fine choice. Just be careful not to scratch the acrylic tank. \ --Also, instead of buying expensive filter cartridges, I remove the blue filter and charcoal, and use far cheaper boxed charcoal and fiberglass floss. --Saves about 75% off the cost of the cartridges 
If Zero Stars had been an option, that would have been my rating. I am currently on my THIRD, yes THIRD return of this tank (luckily I got it from a Petstore, otherwise I would not be able to afford the shipping for all of the returns). Thank God I filled out my warranty card! On all 3 tanks, the filter STOPPED WORKING, despite my WEEKLY cleanings of the tank, filter and magnetic spinner (as well as changing the filter cartridge as suggested, if not sooner). I will NEVER buy a Marineland Tank again 
This tank was purchased for my 5 year old. I have a 10 gallon for myself and she wanted a seperate place for her snails. This tank is awesome. Great price and comes with everything you need but the fish! Take the other readers advice on operation and just enjoy. The only thing is the Bio Wheel can be a bit annoying when the water level is low, but it may not be enough to bother most people. Would buy again 
I have been using it for over a month and I love it. The only disadvantage is that this tank is made of plexiglass which scratches more easily than glass, so you have to be careful when you add gravel. Eclipse 6 has mechanical and chemical filtration, plus biological filtration. The mechanical and chemical filters are enclosed in one easily replaceable unit. Replacements can be found easily at your local Petco or online. (Cost: about $3 per month.) The biological filter (biowheel) never needs replacement. I replaced the light that this system comes with a Hagen, and plants grow fine under that light. Just remember to not add too many fish in the beginning. It takes about 4 weeks for beneficial bacteria to establish on the biowheel. Until this happens the water will have too much ammonia, which kills fish. To kick start the bilogical cycle you have to add some fish. Add a couple of livebearers (platy, guppy, molly etc, but never goldfish). The ammonia level will increase then go down after about 3 to 4 weeks. After this you can add more fish 
I have mixed feelings about this knife. First of all according to the Consumer Report it doesn't cut as well as the Wusthof Classic knives. This size is great for me because I have very small space to prepare food and can't manage with the 8" chef's kife because it is long. 
I would have bought this item the first time I saw it, if not for the lack of information. Other pages have a list of items included in the package whereas this one has none. Who's to know what you're getting? I suggest that this seller at least place an overview of the items the recipient will be getting when ordered 
My dog really loves this bed I really like the idea of a 'cool side' a 'warm side'. However, the color is not what I would call 'moss' (brownish-green), but 'teal' (blueish-green). Just FYI! No complaints about the quality, tho 
HAS WORKED WELL WITH THE CRATE WE PURCHASED TO GO WITH IT. WIPES CLEAN EASILY 
This washable cedar bedding fits in the Pet Gear Home 'N Go soft sided pet crate, and the manufacturers really should have included it with the crate. Don't buy the crate without also purchasing this necessary padding. The combo makes a great "starter home" for your new puppy 
I had been mourning the passing of the Visions line of cookwear for years. Now, finally, the line has returned and on Amazon.com. I LOVE these pots!!! The ones that I have are over 20 yeears old and have suffered through teaching my 2 youngsters how to cook with only 1 pot being broken. In a few years I will be teaching my grandson how to cook with these same pots. The new pots are just as great as my original ones. You have made me very happy by offering them again and over the internet. 
I have several visions pieces. I only keep them because they are handy to use in the microwave; on the stove the only thing they are good for is boiling water. They heat VERY unevenly and develop terrible hotspots. If you drop them or the lid you stand a fair chance of shattering it. The fact that they are transparent has never been useful to me 
Surprised to receive this cookie sheet with a recipe and statement that says that this sheet is great for making a "jelly roll" cake. No Way!...sheet doe NOT have SIDES to hold a batter! Nice size and weight cookie sheet and easy to wash 
I really love these pans - the size is small but that is not really a drawback because I can get 2 of them on one oven rack, so they really give me more flexibility than a larger pan. They still look brand new after about 6 months of use and clean up so easily! I avoid "nonstick" coatings as they always end up peeling off and I am not convinced they are safe, especially peeling, and sometimes you have to live with some sticking that way. But with a light greasing, cookies slide right off these pans even without that yukky teflon coating that so many cookie pans have. Definitely a winner 
I first tried the Shun chefs knife and loved it. This paring knife is great. Everything I want from a paring knife; Sharp, Comfortable, just flexible enough and a great grip. 
We have several Shuns, and they are a cheaper alternative to Hattori. They are worth what you pay, but not the best out there, as some have declared. They, like other top Japanese knives, need to be sharpened at 12 to 15 degrees to get the best performance. This negates their use for heavier use, so a traditional 20 degree knife needs to be kept as well. The Spanish Henckels or Forschners do this well. They are available for lefties, too, but you have to ask or special order them. 
I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives. I finally stepped up and got excellent knives. For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world. Check them out on the Web at kershawknives.com. Great features of the entire line include these cool "D" shaped handles that fit your hand better. Each knife is made in a right- and left-handed version (chefsresource.com for lefties). The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives. The knives are EXTREMELY sharp (cut myself day one). One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives. The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle. This knife is light and just feels right in my small hands. My old knife was 4", but the difference isn't that noticable to me. This knife makes quick work of garlic. It is so sharp that it seems like I just have to lay the knife against the food. This is an expensive, but lifetime investment. I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website. For ratings on various brands and types of knives, check out cooksillustrated.coms' equipment ratings. This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of. 
Before I started doing any serious cooking, I never quite saw the point of the 'big' knives and ended up doing practically everything with a cheap stamped paring knife. Then, I discovered the beauty of the mid-sized chef's knife and the rocking action you can use to make short work of veggie prep. Finally, I discovered the sheer bliss of very sharp large knives starting with the great German brands and graduating to these new Shun knives after my hero, Alton Brown started shilling for Shun and Khershaw. It was easy to forget the utility of a great little paring knife, especially if it was just as sharp as its big brothers. Now that I've gotten one of these little beauties, I have come back to admiring its qualities. Without a very sharp paring knife, jobs like cleaning and butterflying shrimp can be a real drag in that the flesh of the shrimp is so soft, a dull knife won't even cut into it without really dangerous pressure or shear. Here's a poster case for the dangers of dull knives, as you are typically not pressing down on a nice firm cutting board, you are usually cutting toward your thumb or index finger. All lecturing aside, if you do a wide range of cooking, you may not use a paring knife often, but when you do,you will really appreciate having this little sharpie on hand 
I agree with all of the accolades given to this paring knife by other reviewers. It's razor sharp and a work of art. However, it is designed for a right handed person, which shouldn't be surprising given that it's designed and made in Japan. As you may have guessed, I'm left-handed. Most people don't realize how many products are designed for righties and the challenges this presents for lefties. The asymmetry on this isn't so severe that I won't be able to use it, largely because it is so small. The "D" shape described in the product info isn't quite accurate, there is a ridge running down the right side of the handle, designed to fit in the crease of your hand. That ridge hits the middle of my thumb when I hold the knife in my left hand. This knife is great, but I won't be able to get a larger version unless they do away with the "D-shaped Pakkawood handle; comfortable offset steel bolster" or make a left-handed version 
I have a whole set of these blades, so I'm breaking down my review to two parts: Review of the Shun Classic Blades, and the portion as it pertains to this knife in particular. I absolutely love this knife and it's my second most used knife. My first most used is my work horse, the Shun Ken Onion 8" Chef's Knife. There are many small tasks that the Paring Knife is a must for though, and that's when I grab this one. When you want to trim a nice piece of meat, rib a green pepper, etc...you don't want a big knife, you need this little one. It's little, but so sharp that it slices through anything like butter, making prep work so easy and enjoyable. Shun knives are beautiful creations period. Since I'm Asian, I love the tradition look and feel of this Japanese knife. I love the beauty of the blade and the dark, polished, Pakkawood handle. The unique "D"-shaped, Wood handles are preferable. The shape fits my hand perfectly, and the wood does not get slippery when wet - providing a very secure hold. The steel is of utmost quality and sharpness. Do not put this blade into any old electric knife sharpener! Electric knife sharpeners are made to put one angle on any blade. These blades come with a 16 degree angle and you don't want to be changing that angle. There are electric knife sharpeners that can sharpen these knives, but you'll have to do some research and find out which ones can be a fit with these knives. I prefer to hone with a sharpening steel and manually sharpen with a stone if necessary (and I don't see it being necessary to touch it to a stone any time soon). The blade is sharp straight off the factory and as Alton Brown says - it's the sharpest straight out of the factory edge as he's ever seen. These knives are more expensive than most, but I think it's definitely worth it. To have the sharpest, most beautiful knife around - it's no contest. If you are on a budget, build your collection slowly. It's been said that there are only 3 knives that are the absolute basics for any kitchen: A 8" Chef's Knife, a Paring Knife, and a Long Serrated blade for cutting bread and larger items. I would add a thin utility knife and a boning knife to that list next. Then I would add those "in-between" sizes as I get more money flow in. =) If you plan on spending any time in the kitchen, good kitchen knives are a definite must. Preparation is the bulk of cooking and when you have good knives, it cuts down on the danger of cutting yourself, it adds pleasure to the work, and it cuts down on prep time. Knives are also a very personal choice and it's best to at least go to a store and try it out for yourself first. Shun Knives are designed by the Japanese, so remember - it's designed for small hands. This makes it fit most women's hands perfectly, but I've heard of guys with larger hands not like it so much and going back to the German knives. So definitely try it out. It's a personal thing, it needs to fit you. Why spend so much money on a knife? Well, if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and you almost always have to bust out a knife to prep a meal from scratch - why not use the best? Why spend that time with items that you love and brings you pleasure to use? Many times, it's the small things that brings us the most pleasure in life, and I consider my Shun knives as one of those things. Having something so beautiful and yet so sharp and perfect - it makes my time cooking just that much more enjoyable. Another good thing to know is that although the Shun Knives are usually offered for right-handers, you can get these knives for left-handers. You just need to find the guys who stock and sell those ones as they are less known, and less common 
This is my second Shun knife. I fell in love with the knives after using my 10" chef knife for about 6 months. While I use the chef's knife for just about everything, there are certainly times when accuracy and precision are important. You just can't get the same results with a 10" chef's knife as you can with a 4" pairing knife. And so, back to the chef's store I went to try out this little bad boy. It's amazing how sharp these knives are out of the box. Just a few slides on a steel, and the knife is back to peak performance. While I own a ceramic sharpening device, I still haven't had to use it on either knife. This knife is absolutely perfect for any small task: deveining shrimp, peeling fruits or vegetables, cutting tomatoes (especially cherry tomatoes), shaving asparagus, you name it. The only downside with this knife is its price. While you can easily go out to the supermarket and buy a $10 OXO knife that will provide you with some good results, I knew I had to get the Shun after spending a little time with it at the store. It makes all prep work so much easier, and when combined with the 10" chef's, an all-Shun experience that gets the exact results I wanted from fine cutlery. Go get it 
I loved my 6" Shun Chef Knife so much that I just bought two of these little knifelets, one for my mother and one for me. The razor thin edge tore through the bases of 4 day old asparagus like butter-- I am very very pleased. Will use this for tomatoes and everything else that requires a knife of manageable size. Plus, for my mother, who doesn't take very good care of things in the kitchen, these have the advantage of being dishwasher safe, a huge bonus. As the saying goes, when you try a Shun, your German knives are Dun.. 
I love this storage system. The revolving holder is flimsy, but serves it's purpose just fine. I only wish I could find a way to re-order specifice size containers. Every where I've looked, it seems I have to re-order the whole set. I need more of the conveniant mid-size containters 
I have owned this system for 18months, and have never had one of the containers break. It is a great space saver - - I got rid of all my old tupperware-style containers when I purchased this (it is not a space saver if you keep all your old containers too! Okay I kept some 'big' containers in an undercabinent space for the rarer occasion that I need them). I love that the lids are interchangeable! 
This product isn't worth this review, but will give one! The containers split easily, the holders falls apart if you look at it wrong. I had a few containers left and tossed them all. Don't try i 
I really like this cookbook. Many of the recipes are based on a cake mix, which you add additional items to. There are almost-no pictures in the book, but I am glad to have a book specifically of bundt cake recipes 
I bought this set for a recent camping/rv trip. Worked out great. Attractive, unbreakable and practical 
Excellent item at a fantastic price! Holds up well, wonderful to cook in and when you wash it it dries nice, without spots. Highly reccommended cookware. The helping hand on the frying pan is the 'icing on the cake' 
I have a set of the traditional Circulon as well as a piece of the new steel Circulon. I have never had a problem keeping the 'grooves' clean. I put my Circulon in the dishwasher, it's very low maintenance. Food cooks great with it. Both my mother and mother-in-law have made positive comments about it when visiting. I have never had the problems which the negative reviewer has made. I recommend this brand HIGHLY 
I just received this set of cookware and found it to be one of the best I have ever used. I will keep them forever 
After a while you'll never get those rugged concentric grooves clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear. I'd never recommend Circulon cookware because of this, especially since there are so many high-quality, smooth-bottomed pans on the market 
I recieved the sango blue set for my wedding and needed more pieces. If you really like the color blue You'll love this. The color is beautiful. I needed a serving dish. You can use this one for lots of different stuff. It is a bowl but it couold be used a a plater with high sides. It is wide and kind of flat so it has muti-uses. It is truley a must have for anyone who has lots of parties or family dinners 
My Husband and I had a hard time agreeing in a dinnerware set when we got married. After a lot of discussion (I thought we would never make it to the altar at this rate!!), we finally settled on the Sango Nova Blue Pattern. It is beautifully colored, with just about every variation of blue from Navy, to Royal, to a beautiful Sky blue in the glaze pattern. We absolutely love the way it looks. With so many subtle color variations, it can coordinate in a million ways in one's kitchen. We also liked the fact that there were so many coordination bakeware and serveware pieces available too. Nothing looks nicer when you're entertaining than a well coordinated table. We have not regretted our decision yet 
Dyson DC 14 Does the job well really impressed, but then any NEW Vacuum would do that. I have to wait a few months to really know if it continues doing a good job. 
I was a little apprehensive after reading some customer experiences. Luckily, my Dyson arrived in perfect shape. It was fairly easy to assemble. The only weird thing is when you switch it on and have it in upright position, the way it's made, the airflow comes out near the handle. It doesn't affect the functionality of the machine and, as you get to see how the extensions fit together and work, it's simply ingenious! They've done an excellent job putting this together. Also, I'm really glad that Dyson made it to the US. Some other companies here ripped him off, and I'm glad the ORIGINAL cyclonic vaccuum cleaner is on the market here. (No, I don't work for them, I used to live in the UK and know his story). It doesn't bother me that the vaccuum head will only go flush underneath couches - just use the extensions! The amount of very fine particles and fibres it sucks up is amazing. I got at least half a canister full after freshly cleaning with my old vaccuum cleaner. My daughter has allergies, so this will make a difference, I'm sure. The only negative is that the unit falls over fairly easily. It's a very small price to pay, and I would thoroughly recommend it 
Don't be afraid to purchase Reconditioned. The first one came and it had little plastic pieces floating around the box. I logged on and in two minutes I had told Amazon what the problem was and asked for a new one. In two days a new one was at my door! I packaged up the broken one and off it went back. Shipping paid for and everything. The dyson works great, though I have to say I have it under glass and we all just sit there and gaze at how pretty it is and that it's finally "home" AHHHH 
When I bought this machine after haveing to by a new vacuum every year for the past 3 years I was afraid it was all just hype. Amazon shipped it in two days and I was off and running. It is easy to use, not at all noisy, made my rugs look new and picked up everything on my hard wood. Easy to set up and get moving. I would highly, highly reccomend. My 'reconditioned' vacuum came like new with no indication that it was not completely new 
I have two long haired shedding dogs at home, and there is black hair everywhere!! I looked everywhere for a vacuum that could suck up all of the hair! The guy I work with has this dyson at home, he loves it and recommended it. I figured why not - what have I got to loose? Let me tell you - this is the greatest vacuum ever. I used to dread running the sweeper, stopping 10-15 times to clean out the hose, etc. With the Dyson, I have to stop once to empty the canister - but that it is. It sucks and cleans like nothing I have ever seen. I absolutely love this vacuum, and would recommend it to everyone. It is just a shame that I can only give it 5 stars 
Of course, it is a vacuum so that is what it is supposed to do. I am very pleased with this product and impressed by its performance. It really does suck a lot of dirt out of carpet. The carpet actually looks "refreshed" after vacuuming. My only knock against it is the accessories. Using the hand held brushes is a little unwieldy in close quarters. However, my previous vacuum was no star in this area either 
This vacuum has exceeded my hopes and all at a great price! 
This vacuum cleaner is great in theory. In practice, it appears to have been designed by someone who has never actually had to use a vacuum cleaner under realistic conditions. My kids hate using it because it is so bulky and inflexible, even though it is substantially lighter than our previous cleaner; often you have to vacuum over small ordinary bits of thread and lint many many times before the cleaner will grab them...I guess it's some consolation to know that in the meantime, it is sucking up invisible microparticles. Forget about vacuuming under furniture ever again; the hose is held in a long inflexible cumbersome wand that prevents you from working in small spaces; the suction causes the hose to collapse upon itself. The bagless suction is great, but it belongs in machines designed by people who have already come to grips with all the other things a decent vacuum cleaner needs to do. We would never buy one again, never recommend one, and have had frequent cause to regret this expensive purchase 
For $300 this vacuum was a no brainer. It works far better than all the others we've had. Wife is please so I'm happy. Just wish we would have purchased this one before the last two junkers :) The only issue we have is the hose extention length. It would help if it were longer but considering the design and where the hose is located, I'm happy. 
We just purchased the reconditioned Dyson DC 14 and so far it works pretty well: 1. The noise level is a solid "ok". 2. The suction is decent. 3. It has a built-in rotating spiral brush that automatically brushes the rug when the vacuum is turned on. You have the option to turn it off when you have to clean hard wood floors. 4. It has no bag filter which is a plus. The collected dirt can be easily removed from the container with one press of a button. 5.You do have the option to clean the stairs with a very flexible attached cleaning hose that can be extended. 6. Unfortunately the reconditioned version comes only with a 6 month limited warranty. 7. It is a bit bulky but that is forgiveable. 8. The weight of the vacuum could be lighter. 9. The price is reasonable I assume compared to the original retail price of approx. $550. Overall out of a 5 star rating I would rate the DC14 (reconditioned) towards a 4. 
Completely pleased..the pan AND his recipe (Mario's that is) was perfect! P.S. I am WAY over the age of 13 
Maybe because I didn't purchase this a a pizza pan, it has so many more uses. The only restriction is to heat it up as you would a cast iron pan, slow and steady. This pan stays on my range at all times. Pancakes, bacon, heat up vegetables, a quick chicken breast,so many uses and such a great price! Mario has done it again 
The Batali pan is a lot heavier than expected but the handles make it easy to manage. I've only tried using the pan to bake pizza so far and, using my favorite pizza crust recipe, the pan proved to be a very worthwhile investment. I like that it baked the crust quickly at a lower oven temperature than was required with baking stones. It also does an excellent job of drying out the crust to make a nice crunchy feel. That's the way we like our pizza. I'm looking forward to trying it on a few other items - pancakes, roasted vegetables, etc. The pan is definitely worth the price 
This pan is great from the design point of veiw; except that its handle is made so fragile. It could break easily if not handled with care. When I first received it, the packing was poorly done and because of that the handle was broken. I observed the handle and noticed that it could break easily if not handled with care. But the baking surface is excellent and the look is excellent too. So I re-ordered it and I am hoping that this time I will get it in tact. Well, I finally got the second shipment. I still think the packaging is poor for such a fragile item. The packaging from the manufacturer is itself not good; to top it off Amazon's packing was poor also; which is very unusual. Hopefully this will serve as a constructive criticism for future improvement 
I used store bought pizza dough and the pan delivered a nice crispy crust. Here's a hint: roll out or stretch the dough on parchment paper, then transfer the parchment and all directly to the preheated pan. No cleaning of the kitchen counter or the pan 
Wonderful pizza pan. I enjoy having the handles to lift the pan in and out of the oven. Makes very crisp pizza and is easy to clean. I love it 
The first pan arrived with a broken handle due to being packed poorly. After contacting Amazon a replacement pan arrived packed much better and in good shape. Thank you for your quick response 
This pan is great. Read about it in our local newspaper. A chef used it in his home kitchen to test and he loved it. I do to, now I can finally get pizza at home as good as the stuff we used to get in San Francisco North Beach area 
This is a wonderful pizza pan. Makes great pizza and is easy to clean, although, it's a little heavy 
I received many compliments on this beautiful tree. Wish it were a music box too. Folks keep picking it up to turn it on. 
i bought these sheets for about $20. 400tc, egyptian cotton queen size sheets for $20! what an awesome deal--my sheets were a steal, but these are a really great deal for anything under $50. i was prepared for cheap sheets (sometime you never know even with the higher tc), but they turned out to be awesome. the sheets are thick (but not heavy) and soft, and the color is a mellow green. i've had them for 6 months now, and i love them 
I ordered a set of these sheets and originally thought they were very comfortable. After 3 nights of sleeping on them, they began to pill so badly and be uncomfortable that we returned them to Amazon. We were sent replacements. After 2 weeks and a couple washings, these also pilled and were terrible. These were the worst quality sheets I have ever owned 
poor-quality sewing.. elastic snapped on first use.. the feel like cheap cotton and not sateen 
After only one usage and washing pilling of the material made reusing them uncomfortable. When I tried to return them I was refued because 30 days had expired. We hadn't used them until then. I have a balance in my account to use. Other than that we will not be buying from Amazon anymore. Imagine if we were to buy early gifts for someone which had been in our plans. Also, I have since read other complaints of the product with similar responses, yet you still sell them 
I have purchased many sheet sets from Amazon and have always been very pleased. This set, however, is the biggest disappointment ever. Not only do they not feel like sateen, but they "pilled" terribly under me after just one night. 400TC should never do this! What a waste of money. They now sit in my closet. I don't want to put them back on my bed, doing so would feel like I was punishing myself. I purchase up to 1200TC to reward myself! With the excessive pilling, I wouldn't even want these if I got them for free. DON'T PURCHASE THESE SHEETS 
This is a great sheet set. Nice cotton. The only thing I would advise is taking them out of the dryer while they are alittle damp and putting them on the bed. They don't wrinkle as bad that way and don't have to iron them. They are a very nice cotton, not lightweight, but just right. I've enjoyed them very much. Would recommend!! 
As subject says. Soft and comfortable. For the price, you can't beat it. Fits well 
Feels nice fresh from the package, despite the loose threads (poor-quality sewing I'm sure). After 3 washings, they are starting to pill. They have also shrunk, and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze. Definitely not 400TC, and definitely not Egyptian cotton. Waste of $20 
It really cools the wine fast and looks nice. Great gift to take to a dinner party. Not good for keeping things cold for long (1+ hours), so drink fast 
I mostly pick projects that require rounds. This is perfect as I can mix and match sizes and lengths-not having to run out and buy new circular needles each time!!! 
This set is substantial in size. They were easy to fill because the plastic plug partially screws, unlike others that require a lot of pulling and prying to remove the stoppers. The finish is easy to maintain 
Was looking for a crockpot small enough to cook one meal for two. I have used this one for soups, and stews and it works perfectly. It is a great time saver and the price is right. 
Umm I think this is the same one I have! When it comes to quart sizes it's all the same to me, haha. Anyway, I love my lil crockpot. It's one of those nifty items that has so many uses, you can have it for a long time and still discover something new it can do. I've cooked all kinds of things in this. Beans are a dream to make now; I don't even soak them anymore, just toss them in with some water and they're good to go. I like this because it has a lot of great features. The best is the removable inside. That makes it so much easier to clean. Seriously: don't buy one with a non-removable innerware! You'll spend extra effort bending over it with a wet towel because you can't submerge it. With this kind, you can take it out and even put it in the dishwasher, and the work is done for you. It's awesome. I think everyone should have one. It's not only for big families, either; I live alone and use it a lot. My advice as to the size, get this particular one because it can make enough for one person if that's your thing but it can also make enough for three or four. So go for it. 
I had one of these for over 10 years and it never gave me a day's trouble. The only reason I purchased a new one was that the old model did not have a removable crock. Fantastic addition to the small family's kitchen 
I love this smaller crockpot for dips of any kind. My family has food at every get together and having this 2 1/2 quart crockpot is perfect. It makes cleaning up easier too 
This is a must for anyone who longs for a sharp knife. For many people this type of sharpness is unknown, and should be experienced and enjoyed. Sharpening should be left to Kyocera, as they can do the best possible job, and this knife should only need to be sharpened about every 5-10 years based upon how often you use it. I agree with the chipping liability but this is a small price to pay to have an INCREDIBLE knife in the kitchen, be sure to keep your eyes on what you are slicing 
The Kyoto Ceramic company makes all kinds of stuff out of ceramics. From circuit boards and transmitters in mobile phones to excellent writing pens with sturdy ceramic tips, they've got their brand of excellence in everything. Their entire line of ceramic knives is no different! Being hardened ceramic, this knife and its brethren cannot be rusted and the blade seems to stay sharper a lot longer because the edge doesn't need to be trued like steel. It's non-reactive to acids and bases and you can easily clean its surface with warm, soapy water. The weight balance and blade control are excellent and the knife seems to dance as it cuts. I am really impressed with the overall quality of the blade itself. There is only one caveat, but it is a BIG one: the blade WILL chip if you are not careful! Cutting on surfaces other than cutting boards (i.e.-plates or pizza stones) can cause tiny chips in the edge. Improper sharpening (you should get a sharpener specific for a ceramic knife and use it exactly as instructed) and throwing the knife in drawers without a blade cover will also chip the blade edge. Dishwashing is a no-no, since the edge might be damaged, as well. If you get some chips or nicks, the blade will still cut, but the edge will slowly become serrated instead of smooth. I recommend getting a proper sharpener, bamboo cutting board and blade guard for this or any other ceramic knife so that you can make the knife last for generations! A good buy, overall, but only if you take care of it 
I ordered various cookie cutter sizes and shapes. I was pleased with them all. They were shipped quickly and packaged carefully 
I just started buying Fiesta Ware and Amazon has been the best source. I love the combination of persimmon and cinnabar and have acquired quite a bit of these dishes. I like all sizes of plates and bowls, which are heavy and durable. Persimmon is my favorite color but second is cinnabar 
Enjoy the different colors, able to mix and match to suit moods or food being served. They seem to wear well and be chip resistant. The only downside for me is that one of the Cinnabar plates came with an "etched" scratch mark on it. Not sure if it was from manufacturing. It is only slightly visible. They are "standard size" dinner plates. At times, wish they were just a little bit bigger. Otherwise, so far quite happy with them and they can always be replaced.. 
I have used the same Fiesta Ware for the last 12 years and I have not broken a piece yet! Even when my 2 teenage boys were babies, and doing dishes, a piece may have slipped out of their hands, but nothing was ever broken. This shows how durable the Fiesta Ware really is. I would highly recommend Fiesta Ware to everyone of all ages. I own 3-20 piece settings at the present time and plan on expanding. I like the fact that you can collect all different colors and it looks great! I will be ordering more for when my 2 boys go to college. I plan on ordering my mother a 20 piece set for her birthday. I love it and I know you would toooo 
You just can't go wrong with Fiestaware. It's sturdy, durable, attractive, cleans up easily (from table to dishwasher to cabinet). And if my rough-on-dishes family can't break it, no one can 
I work in an assisted living facility and we use Fiestaware in the Alzheimer's area. These dinner plates are great because you have room for a main dish and two side dishes as well as a dinner roll. With being used in an Alzheimer's area, these plates are occassionally abused. I have seen the accidently dropped and I have seem the purposely pushed off of the table. In either case, the plate didn't break. Though they were a little pricey (and we even get a deal because we buy in large quantities), they are worth it. Ours seem to last forever. They get used for all 3 meals, plus snacks. And, if we need it, these plates have double and mini serving platters 
I have occasionally noticed restaurants using Fiestaware, which is an accurate testament to the product's durability 
I always loved the original Fiestaware that my Grandma had.I was very happy when the new line came out.I purchased my first placesettings at least 8 years ago and they are wonderful! They take a lot of abuse as we don't have a dishwasher and not one has broken or cracked. My sister had bought Pfaltzgraff at the same time and has since replaced them all as they cracked,chipped and discolored.I am still buying additions to my sets. Now my kids are buying it for themselves. Great stuff 
What's not to love? Fun Halloween shapes, good size for cookies with kids -- not too big or two small. Easily recognizable shapes. Metal, so they cut well. And they come on a ring, so you can keep the organized! I'm even adding some of my other cutters to this handy ring 
I've never used a slow-cooker before, but it made me an expert after the first time. I cooked a delicious pot-roast one afternoon and it cleaned up very nicely, too. The removeable crock is very convenient and cooled down relatively quickly after turning it off and removing the food. No scrubbing was necessary and that was what I was most impressed with. Nice clean look and I'm sure I'll make use of the two smaller dip trays that were included. Package included a few recipes which is great for a beginner like me 
Just wanted to say I finished making a delicious beef stew with my new slow cooker. It is wonderful. Came in excellent condition all the temperature settings definitely are very different. Our stew was cooked on high for 4 hours and now its on keep warm. I absolutely love the new appliance. Its wonderful to be able to throw a meal together in the morning/afternoon and evening time its done. I don't have to stand over it and watch it. I am making a chili for my dog tomorrow. I love it! I recommend it to everyone 
This is a great idea. I still use a crockpot cookbook my mother gave me 15 years ago. With my old rival crockpot, in order to get the meat just right, the vegetables and potatoes would overcook. With the Hamilton Beach, the meat turns out great and I put the vegetables in the second dish, later in the cooking cycle. Both come out the way the should. Don't settle for a one purpose unit when you can get the Hamilton Beach 
this crock pot has 3 settings: warm, scalding and blast furnace. warm cooks nothing, scalding evaporates liquids and drys food in less than 2 hrs, and blast furnace should be used in place of kiln. The worst feature / drawback of this not-so-fine unit is the hot water spitting that occurs after 2 or so hours that leaves your countertops wet and messy. I returned this and bought a Rival. Far better - no comparison 
These sheets are extremely nice and I am very pleased with them. They fit my older mattress well but are made so they would also work for a deeper pocket. They do wrinkle some when washed but still remained soft. Great value for the price and I would definitely buy these again 
This sheet set is one of the best,the bottom sheet has elastic all the way around for a great fit plus they are soft. Wash without fading. Great produc 
I bought 3 king sets when these were on sale, and my only regret is that I didn't buy more. Even at regular price, these are worth the money. They are so smooth and silky soft - and I am super picky about sheets. I absolutely WILL NOT sleep on any sheet that has ANY pilling or roughness going on. My skin is too sensitive. The pockets are deep, and the sheet stays on the bed. They also launder well. I do wish there were darker shades though. These pastels are nice, but I prefer deeper shades. That won't stop me from buying more though - I can't see the color when I am blishfully asleep 
The sheets were soft right out of the package. We bought the sage green king size. The color is nice and the pockets are extra deep. I have a pillow top and there is more than enough room to keep the sheets in place. I highly recommend these sheets and will be purchasing more for myself in the near future 
I just love my new sheets, and I like getting then at such a low price 
Really comfortable sheets. Looks like they could be high quality and long lasting. Smooth and soft. Delivery was good. Value was O.K. at $59 
If you have a mattress with deep corners, not a problem, covers the pillow tops with ease and the material is extremely comfortable 
These sheets are extremely soft and durable. We've had them for about a week and love them. Washed three times already and still look as if brand new. The hot water doesn't affect them at all. Not sure why this would be, but both husband and I have had a better nights sleep sleeping on these sheets. They are very comfortable. Soft and luxurious. I would highly recommend and give them as gifts. 
I have had a Brikka for about three weeks now and think is the greatest! It is easy to use, clean and the espresso comes out with crema and is very hot every time! I haven't had any problems with it at all. A few tips: In order to unscrew it for cleaning, simply run it under cold water for a minute and then pull the valve inside the top chamber up to release the pressure. Then, it will unscrew easily. Also, you will hear a distinct noise when the espresso is almost finished. You can look into the top of the coffee maker and see the crema. At this point, don't wait too long before you take it off the stove and serve, as the creme will disappear if you cook it too long. Enjoy 
I have been drinking my Cuban coffee since I was four years old; so I have some experience with espresso and the usual Moka pot. The Brikka absolutely makes a fantastic espresso, even with a standard, store-bought brand like Bustelo or Paloma. The crema is delicious - I had no problem getting it, even in the beginning with the first few "sacrificial" pots. The coffee is so smooth. I've also brewed side by side with my other pots and there is a difference; it just taste yummy (that's the right word here). Don't worry that you can't get the 2 cup in the US - The 4 cup will do you fine; really, it's not that big a deal. The 4 cup looks larger than you'd expect - but I think that's just because it needs extra room to make the steam. 4 "cups" of espresso is not even one full cup of American coffee. There's no need to hesitate . . .buy it and enjoy 
I bought mine about a month ago and love it. First, someone mentioned how difficult it is to take apart - after I make the coffee, I rinse it with cool water, then lift up lightly on the valve. After the pressure is dissipated, it is very simple to unscrew the top from the bottom. I still am not getting crema most of the time, and the amount of coffee varies even though I am being very careful about using the right amount of water (just up to the line in the plastic measuring cup). The last pot I made, I packed the coffee slightly and ended up with about 30% more coffee than any other time I've made it. I've been using Lavazza espresso coffee (from the supermarket, already ground, in a can). It tastes fine to me (I'm not a nut about the coffee process, I just like espresso/moka). I'd like to get more crema to see if it tastes different, but I do love the coffee I'm getting. I use it almost every day. I did have one minor problem with it - the relief valve on the bottom leaked water/bubbles around it. I simply tightened it a bit with a wrench and since then, it's fine. I definitely noticed a difference in the quality and quantity of the coffee after tightening the valve. Before I fixed it, the coffee was burnt tasting and I got only about 1/2 of what I now normally get 
I have used this espresso maker for two months and find it excellent. It takes a little time to get proportions right but eventually it produces a very good cup of coffee. I had two the Bialetti Moka Easy electric models and both failed in a relatively short time. This stove-top model is a much better alternative 
I actually bought this for my wife for her birthday - but I think I enjoy it more then she does. I know that this doesn't make "true" espresso but it comes mighty close in my opinion (i'm not much of a connoisseur, but I do love a good cup). In fact this is better then most any other espressos i've had! I love the coffee this thing produces! The first night I ended up drinking 6 shots of 'espresso' made with fresh Baba Budan beans and I still wanted more! I couldn't do it though because it was 1:00 in the morning and I was wide awake from drinking so much coffee. Here are a few tips for you... Make sure you have a Burr grinder. You want a fine grind (but not too fine) to get the most out of your coffee. Burr grinders can be quite the investment but well worth it. You will need a Burr grinder for any espresso machine anyways. Make sure you have cups close by. This thing will suddenly shoot out coffee and if you're not quick enough you might get some coffee on your stove... as soon as you hear the gurgle and whistle get your cup ready! (you'll know what i'm talkin about...), After a few rounds you'll have it down. Chances are your first pot will not turn out perfect (unless you've done something like this before...which I haven't). The good news is that after your first time you will understand how the process works and everything will be fine after that! Clean this as soon as you can! It will be hot for awhile but try to clean it ASAP to make cleaning easier. It's worth it... trust me. Follow the instructions EXACTLY. It's not hard to do by any means but make sure you read the instructions. if you accidently do something wrong such as pack in the coffee tightly then you will be sorry. The instructions are very simple but very useful. I noticed one reviewer mentioned that this coffee comes out tasting burnt. If you grind your coffee too fine then it gets caked inside the coffee holder and it takes longer for the coffee to make it up inside the main chamber (excuse my lack of correct terminology). This does cause a burnt flavor because only a little bit of coffee comes out at a time which causes that little bit to become a bit burnt before the next splash comes through. If you grind it slightly more coarse then this will not happen and your coffee will taste amazing. I have a feeling that the people that mention the burnt flavor are grinding their coffee a bit too fine. You want the coffee to be ground fine but not like flour... more like fine sugar. Have fun! This simple little gadget makes a fine cup. Enjoy 
First I'd like to thank my friend Tony from Italia for introducing me to this little gadget on our campout last month. Secondly I'd like to thank Daigo for his excellent write up and Brikka blog. If you are a coffee addict especially to espresso, macchiato or cordato AND are a cheapskate like myself then you've found yourself the right product. While technically mokka isn't espresso, it's pretty darn close and only an espresso aficionado will know the difference. This product does a great job of making that intense, robust elixir to sharpen the senses. I've had it for about a month now and find myself daily back on any street in Italy or Spain. Mornings start out with a couple machiatos/cordatos (espresso with foamed milk) and then comes the afternoon espresso bump. It's great! If you don't want to drop the $500 for the official machine then this little guy will do the job. A note concerning the crème and 4 cup/2 cup controversy. To be honest, my 4 cup maker cranks out the crème. You have to play with the grind, the way it's packed and even the volume of water you add. Folks say the 4 cup won't do it but down here in Texas it does it's job. Lot's of crème in the pot and on my lips! :) So, maybe it's the water or technique, I don't know. But rather than going through the cost and hassle of getting an Italian 2 cup version I recommend you get this. Criticisms?? Well I gave this 4 stars because it is a bit tedious to get your coffee going and more of a pain to clean. My biggest gripe is unscrewing the bottom tank from the top - It's a real bear even when completely cool. All in all, it's a great product worth the money. I'd buy it again given the chance. If you love espresso and don't want to buy the Ferrari then get this, you won't be disappointed. 
I agree with Daigo and others that the Brikka (I only have the 2-cup model) makes a really nice café that, while technically not espresso, is very, very tasty. And the 2-cup model DOES produce crema. As for david's results, it's puzzling. If the coffee is boiling in the upper chamber, I'd guess not enough pressure is building. I would speculate that the seal between the chambers is not complete. Check to see if there are any grounds breaking the seal before you screw them together. If there is nothing blocking a perfect seal, I'd suspect a defect. Even if the 2-cup model is superior to the 4-cup, I can't imagine a functioning 4-cup to produce the results you're getting 
Well, I guess I'm in the minority here, but following to the letter its instructions (for the 4 cup Brikka), the coffee always seems to boil in the top chamber, no matter how low a flame I use or how quickly I get it off the stove when coffee starts coming out the top. If you like strong, burnt tasting coffee, this is the machine for you. I wanted to like the Brikka, but for under 30 bucks, try an Aerobie Aeropress (recently got one and I love it) and compare espresso results. For a great cup of strong coffee, it's very hard to beat the french press 
Full review with pictures and video: http://daigoexpressed.net/brikka Wonder how Brikka makes crema? Actually, it's a simple and neat trick at the nodule of the upper chamber from where the coffee comes out. Brikka has a metallic valve on the nodule that keeps the coffee from coming out until the pressure of the coffee from the bottom chamber becomes string enough to push up the valve. Once the valve opens, the coffee comes out with a strong pressure going through the narrow exit of the nodule. This makes the similar effect of the espresso machine, and thus foams the crema. How does it taste? It's by far superior than moka pot, or cheap espresso machine when you carefully follow the instruction that comes with Brikka. The crema is very smooth, and the coffee has the characteristic of espresso. The instruction includes the careful measurement of water, strength of the stove flame, and shaking down the new Brikka for the first use. The crema is such a delicate matter, and you also have to be careful when you pour the coffee into the cup. All these things may sound too much work, but actually it's not bad at all after you get use to it. Washing Brikka may be more pain than the all in one espresso maker, but I cannot complain when given this good production of coffee, and brewing a good coffee in a traditional way is always fun. The pot is made with aluminum. I saw some reviews that complained that it is not made from stainless steel, but I also heard most of the Italian makers say aluminum pots make better coffee, and I believe it is because of its high conductivity. This review is based on two-cup 
The coffee I made with the Brikka tastes so much better than any I've made before...and I have an espresso machine, which I no longer use. The directions do say to leave the lid open while you are brewing, so the see-thru part is unnecessary really. 
I thought this was a nice pan, but I don't think it was quite worth the $16 plus shipping. I thought it would be heavier for that price. It's still a good pan and I found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts. They usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet, but I just used the pan instead with fine results. I do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal store-bought cake donuts, but still they are good. Just don't over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking. Nothing stuck, not even to the center flutes. I will definitely use it again and try many different recipes. The donuts are not too big or too small. Fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out, it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better 
I'm a proud celiac chick from Finland, but I'm also a lover of homemade donuts. Now, for those of you who don't know what celiacs are, we can't eat any wheat or gluten. In plain-speak (no, I'm not implying you're stupid), we can't eat flour. It runs along the lines of an allergy, although the experts will gladly look down their noses and tell you it is NOT. So how the heck do I eat donuts when they're made completely of flour? The answer is my cooking angel, Bette Hagman, who wrote up a donut recipe in one of her books, More from the Gluten Free Gourmet. Anyway, I use that recipe. However, I don't use this donut mold like I'm supposed to. No, I don't do baked donuts-what's a donut if you don't do the indulgent full-fat thing? I put the batter into three of the molds at a time, tip it into the oil, and I deep fat fry those little suckers. And god, are they good! So, my ultimate point here is that this donut mold is extremely useful, in more ways than one. So grab one--especially if you're a celiac--and put your imagination and cooking skills to work 
This is what I was looking for to cover my other burners while I cook, but the depth of the covers do not reach down to the stoves surface. You can tell that they don't fit the burners, but it is covering them and I will deal with that for the price that they cost 
These are very attractive to look at. Although the discription is a little wrong. It says green flower pots on white background, but the background is actually cream. I have a white stove therefore the covers clash a little, but they are pretty and fit nicely. I would have given it a 5 stars if the color would have been correct 
What can I say? It lives up to its hype: it covers 1 stick of butter and fits into my decor. 
This is the best covered butter dish I have ever owned. It is very durable, dishwasher and microwave safe, and has a handle on the lid which most do not 
Excellent product. I especially like the roominess of the cover...no more butter crawling up the sides! Yea 
It came quickly, 6 days with Amazon's free shipping. It came today and within 10 mins all my knifes were very sharp. I then gave my new OXO 6.5 knife (I ordered this with the hone) a few passes over my sharping stone then 10 light passes on the hone "WOW" I can shave with this now. I like the handles/grips on all of my OXO products. Very pleased. Well worth the price (14.95 
This is the usual high quality of OXO however it's a bit smaller then I expected. The directions told me to put the tip on the counter and sharpen down and toward you, a different method the I had been using but it works quite nicely 
Very good kitchen tool, as always with KitchenAid. Enough said 
This is the best all-around media storage cabinet i have owned in over 25 years of storing media. It's outside design is great. The shelving design inside is flexible so you may use it to hold CDs, DVDs, Videos, including those "non-standard sized special edition sets" if you like. It's durable. I've bought six of these and placed two in 3 of the rooms in my house, each of which have different furniture/spacing availability and I've found that these are the right overall size for all of my conditions. 
Beautiful and solid, this cd storage unit arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Its simple, clean lines perfectly match our aesthetics. Now that our cd's are organized, we listen to them more, since it's easier to find what we've got. Our only challenge is to find exactly where to put it since you need ample room on either side to open the deep doors with the cd's in them. 
This cabinet is pretty, very well made and great for cd storage. It came in a timely manner and was very well packaged. I would buy another one if I needed it in a heartbeat. 
This is an excellent item for media storage which delivered all that it promised and then some. It is very well made; the wood of superior quality [not pressed board] and the shelves are perfectly made. It does store CDs, DVDs and VHS media depending on how you arrange the shelving. The shelves fit in on little pegs which can be arranged in whatever hight your media requires. In fact, the assembly was far more simple than I had imagined; only the shelves needed to be put in place. I was so happy with it I bought two more. 
The first order for this arrived damaged and had to be sent back and replaced. The second shipment arrived in better shape and is exactly what I was searching for. However, it had a broken shelf which was replaced. I am a very satisfied customer as the cabinet was exactly what I wanted, however I was disatisifed with the packaging and shippment process due to the damage ... although I must admit, the company was very responsive to my return and replacement needs 
This is a very sturdy, beautiful piece of furniture. It holds an incredible amount of cds, and looks wonderful in our room. The storage cabinet was packed very well, and looks beautiful. 
I was so pleased with the description of this product that I ordered two. Today I have placed my order for the third. The finish is beautiful, and the cabinets very well built. The design is handsome, a welcome addition to our livingroom. One of the units was dammaged in shipping, and the company replaced the part fairly quickly. We have a large collection of DVDs and tapes, with numerous attemps over thiry years at storing them. This is by far the best solution we have found. 
I have had this grinder for just a few days, but have to say overall I love it. In particular I like how easy it is to set the coarsness of the grind an the volume and just hit a button and walk away. There is one item that is clear in the instruction booklet however. The bean hopper (holder for the beans) can be removed and placed in the dishwasher for cleaning. I couldn't for the life-of-me figure out how to get it off. Well, you simply turn the bean-holder counter-clockwise until it unscrews. This is not intuitive because turning the holder left or right also changes the coarseness setting. Caution - empty the beans out of it first or they'll wind up all over your counter! (I shouldn't be permitted to do anything mechanical before having my morning coffe! Also, depending on the fine-ness of the grind you select, it will produce a slightly higher or lower volume of cofee. For instance, I found that the medium coarsness setting, set on 8 cups, actually produced enough coffee for 9 or 10. I found that the slightly finer grind 2 clicks of the dial-away, (which worked better for a metal filter) produced exactly the right amount for 8 cups. After your first batch you'll get the hang of it. What's nice about this is once you know what amount and fine-ness to set, you can just dump the coffee into your coffee maker rather than having tomeasure it out a spoon at a time. The re-conditioned grinder comes with a 90 day warrantee vs. a longer warrantee for a new one. 
I purchased the very same Factory-Reconditioned model from Amazon and it didn't work! Amazon sent me another right away and it has been great for a few months. I must admit that I do not make espresso at home and I no longer use the old perculator, so I cannot speak to the fine and coarse settings. I use it daily. It is really loud, but that's not a problem for me 
I have resisted a burr grinder for years -- too big, too complicated, too hard to clean. Got a French Press recently and was advised by Starbucks Barrista to get a burr grinder for the best coffee experience. Well, I got the reconditioned Cuisinart Supreme and am absolutely thrilled! It's not too big and clumsy and is very easy to clean. The ease of storing the beans in the unit and just hitting start for an accurate measure and grind is incredible. Have only tried the medium grind in my drip pot so far and the flavor is definitely superior to the blade ground coffee. I should also mention that I use an Amazon Visa card that earns Amazon points $25 at a time so this grinder only cost $9.99 and the shipping was free. My usual experience with Amazon is that they under promise and over deliver -- got a great product at a very good price that was delivered almost a week earlier than I expected 
This grinder is good enough for a french press fa real fa real. Love the hopper. Haven't tried to clean it yet but looks simple enough. Feels solid, good engineering 
Well, can all my plaudits. Three weeks of moderate use and it's already broken. BAH 
I purchased a better coffee grinder at a lower price than I could find at a local store, and I received it promptly as well 
This works much better than the blade type grinder. I think you get a much better flavor from your coffee and it seems milder also. I would highly recommend this mill 
This unit is awesome. Best looking and best working for the money. I couldn't ask for a better working item for the money. Put the beans in and set and you get the ground coffee in seconds. 
This grinder may be noisier than some others, but it stays clean and grinds a perfect grind each and every time. Excellent 
Since I no longer have a gas stove, I purchased the Rival electric wok. The temperature is consistent, the bowl of the wok is large so plenty of veggies etc. can be stir fried.I'm very pleased with my purchase of the Rival wok 
We got this for our apartment and have been very happy. No cord is nice, and with the charge station it's always ready to go. In our small one-bedroom it's not a pain to empty the small compartment a couple times each time we vacuum the place, the trash can is close. Only problem is that every 5 vacuums or so the rotating brush gets snagged where hair wraps around it. Otherwise, good power and small size is fun and eas 
I've had this little vac for about a month now and I use it ALL the time and just love, love, love it. It's great for the RV and it's just what I needed for my entry room and kitchen. Using it in these rooms, which only takes a couple of minutes every day, keeps the mess out of the rest of the house and soooo easy!!! Now I don't have to drag that big vac around the house so often. The Dirt Devil is easy to use and it's easy to clean. It's light weight and does a great job on my floors and flat carpeting. And it holds a charge for as long as I've needed it. So far, maybe 15 or 20 minutes at a time. This is the best purchase I've made in a long time and I highly recommend this little work horse. 
This vacuum does a pretty good job. It is lightweight and easy to use. It stays charged for quite a long time. The purpose is not intended for general housecleaning but for convenience and quick use it is great 
Despite repeated cleaning and even removal of filters, this vacuum lacked the suction to pick up all but the finest dust after only 1 month. We threw it out 
The Dirt Devil 083414 Extreme Power Stick (cordless) Vacuum really performs! I did 1200 square feet and it was still going strong. Bigger collection cup than others, and this Dirt Devil goes easily from the bare floor to the area rugs, or carpet, without a hitch. I have a lot of tile with area rugs and some carpet. Every other vacuum I have had sucked up the area rugs and had to be lifted onto them and avoid the edges. This vacuum just rolls right on and cleans them corner to corner! I leave the brush on all the time since we have 2 large hairy dogs. The hair does not build up in the brush because suction is strong enough to pull it thru. Small footprint, stores on charging base, lightweight and easy to assemble and use. It has dual filters so there is absolutely NO EMISSION smell and the outside filter that protects the inside filter is very easy to clean, then all snaps right back in place. The best stick vacuum out there. 
When I found this listing, I thought the "Extreme Power Stick Vacuum" meant the suction was powerful. I apparently was wrong. This vacuum won't even pick up dust bunnies off the tile floor. Purchasing this item was a waste of my time and my money. 
This dirt devil has been a life saver for me. It picks up lint, dog hair, crumbs from every meal my 2 boys eat and pretty much every other small thing on the floor. It has good suction and does an ok job on carpet too (it won't pull up the dirt embedded in the carpet, but picks up the noticeable stuff.)The only thing I would change is that the size of the floor piece is pretty small...which helps it store easily, but it takes a little longer to vacuum each area. Overall, well worth the money spent 
I purchased this vaccuum just to use on the hard floor surfaces in my home. And it is great for picking up food crumbs and hair off the floor. I love it! 
When I bought mine there was no reviews. I have the same problems as the other reviewers have. Feathers poking through. I was suckered by the low price. Stay far away from this product 
From the dates on the reviews below, it seems we all got suckered by the low price--but this product it HORRIBLE. The package labeling says it has a 210 count "Down and Feather Proof" shell. But if you want to experience this product without buying it, just throw a handfull of straight pins in you bed. This stupid thing has drawn BLOOD. I am requesting full refunds from amazon for both sizes that I ordered, and may even speak to an attorney. 
Like the other two people who already commented, my Blue Ridge 2" Baffle Box Feather Bed (Queen Size) looks good and is nicely priced (I purchased it as an Amazon 'Deal of the Day' item), but unless you enjoy feathers poking you all over, you should avoid this product at any cost. I have two sheets, one flannel, covering the product, and I am still being uncomfortably poked 
looked good... but the feathers are constantly poking you, even through the flannel sheet! I'm going to cover it with a mattress pad and then the sheet and hopeully that will correct the problem. 
What more can I say? I was very pleased and surprised with how quickly they arrived 
Great transaction. Fast shipping, geniune Miele bags. Will purchase from this seller again 
Okay, so it's hard to get excited about things like HEPA filters - or the vacuum cleaners and other devices they are used in. When my wife concluded her extensive search for a replacement to our old canister vacuum and anointed Miele the winner, I was slightly less enthusiastic than she. It's a vacuum cleaner. It's just a tool for keeping things trim. After a very short while I began to understand her admiration for the design and build quality of this particular tool. The HEPA filters and bags used are no less a part of this than is the vacuum itself. If you tire of vacuums that are constantly gritty with the dust they stir-up but don't quite capture, get a Miele. If you distain the smell emanating from your vacuum's exhaust, get a Miele. If you long for a simple, easy to use and maintain system that even your husband will use, get a Miele. Use genuine Miele bags, and change your HEPA filter as recommended. The difference in cost is minor, but you will be amazed at the difference in results 
I had been using my Victorinox steak knives for all my cutting needs because I can't be bothered to get out my huge cooking knives and have to clean them afterward (yes, I am that lazy). I finally decided to get some knives for paring, etc. that I can throw in the dishwasher. The first time I used the paring knife in this set I actually cut my thumb because they are so much sharper than what I had been using (yes, I have that horrible habit of cutting towards my thumb and not away). Anyway, I was pretty impressed. This is a good brand, and this is a nice little set 
I have had my set of "Swiss Army" paring knives (in red) for something like 15 years. I have always called them my "ultimate paring knives." The serrated knife is by far my favorite for slicing up fruit and other small tasks. It's amazing they are still very sharp and cut perfectly after so long. I just discovered them here on Amazon, I haven't seen them for sale for a long time. You can't really go wrong with these knives 
I adopted a 6 year old male coon hound. He was already set in his ways being an older dog. I started working with him with the training collar on. I rarely had to even use the shocking button. The collar made training very easy. He can be able to be free and run but also know that I am still the master and follow my commands. Just by using the tone button on the remote. I stared training him with a much shorter range collar and it did not give him the freedom that I wanted while training. The collar is very durable and works very effectivly for me and my dog. I recommend this training collar to anyone who is serious about training 
Works like it should, no problems, good pricing. Would like to have a regular size battery in the handheld, but almost all of them use the same odd battery.. 
My collar stopped working after 3 months. Innotek doesn't honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer (which doesn't include Amazon) 
This product I bought and not only did the top break when I opened it, the wipes dried within a day so badly I had to reseal in a ziplock bag. The wipes leave a milky film on my stainless steel refridgerator that I buff off with a mitt designed to clean stainless steel I got from Bed Bath and Beyond. Alone this product does not work as they say, I don't recommend it 
I bought these because I liked the idea, but the wipes always leave streaks and dry out too quickly. I definitely won't buy them again 
I really like these wipes for all of my stainless steel appliances. They clean and shine everything really well. I just use a soft cloth to dry the appliances after wiping them down. I also use the spray made by the same company along with the wipe. I have several appliances and 1 wipe dries out before I am finished. No streaks doing it this way. 
I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances. I'm not the only one. Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways. It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product. Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend. On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking 
This Stool is very versitle, it is a step ladder, it's a stool, and it's a fashion decorator accessory for kitchen. 
I have wanted one of these for years. I put off because I didn't want to put it together. (I'm a 75 year old,alone). I kept looking for one locally. Guess what !!! It's already assembled... comes as you see it. Thanks so much 
I bought this stool for my daughter to use in her 6th grade classroom. It serves as both a step stool for retrieving needed materials on top shelves in the classroom, and a place to once in a while sit in front of the students. She loves it! Lori thinks it's the coolest (and it is!) addition to a classroom, and the bright red color makes it a happy fixture in the room. So while this is very servicable item, it also looks retro cool to the students. Sharon Perkins, Cordele, G 
This step stool is not worth it - the steps that are shown extended in the photo connect only via a plastic groove in the red plastic cross bars shown on the legs of the stepstool. Therefore, when you move the stool, the steps flop along. You have to move them out yourself and put them back in yourself. They come off too easily so you are having to place them inside the groove whenever you move the stool/chair. The stool itself is very small and while this is OK for a stationary perching stool, it is NOT good for a step stool and too small and uncomfortable as a seat 
My Grandmother had one of these in her kitchen and it was always my favorite place to climb up and sit at her breakfast counter. I loved it and am so glad to see it back in style. After possibly hundreds of children and adults using it to sit, stand and climb, and after 50+ years, it is still working and in fine condition. If these new ones are as good quality, definitely a great buy! Very sylish too! : 
My husband bought me these for Christmas and I love them. The cups are thick.. feel like a restaurant cups, and the tree is very decorative. I love the way they look and feel. We use them every single morning for our coffee. 
Although I'm not using the cups that came with the set, the mug tree looks very nice against my white/black color scheme. It is sturdy and easy to clean 
I'm very happy with the quality of this set. One small problem that I'm sure Bodum will stand behind is a hairline crack at the bottom of one of the handles. Highly recommended 
This was the perfect size and shape for my morning cup of coffee. The stand makes it convenient to have them next to my coffee maker. I am very satisfied with the purchase. 
a perfect addition for any kitchen--attractive and functional--shipped quickly and arrived intact--the price was very competativ 
The cups are heavy and huge. The cup stand is beautiful. The cups are brittle and break easily 
I opened this mixer and it was broken. I shipped it back. I did however order another and it was in great condition 
I don't always like purchasing reconditioned things but got in on a great deal during a sale and so couldn't pass it up, as it ended up only like $30 more than a spare 6 qt bowl for my other Kitchenaid! So I got it as a second mixer and love it. Yeah its a little loud but that's fine, I think its supposed to sound that way. I prefer coated beaters because I'm lazy and like a dishwasher safe attachment but I can order one if I really want it. But the main thing is, this is just like brand new and you can't beat the price 
This machine has plenty of power but the beater attachments leave 1/2" of dough/batter unmixed on the walls of either bowl. I don't have the blind love for the "idea" of the kitchenaid brand that most of the self-declared gormet buyers have--it flat-out isn't worth it unless you need to be seen using one to fit in with your friends. It's a great deal in dollars per pound and "old world" charm. I have actually gone back to using my $60 consumer quality dual-beater mixer. I think this mixer really shines when you bolt on the saussage-maker or cigarette-roller attachment on the PTO sticking out the front 
Love it! Love it! Love it! What more can I say. Works great. Like new 
I bought this mixer knowing that I was taking a chance on the quality and this time it paid off. I bake occasionally and this has satisfied my needs completely. I haven't tried any add-ons yet but may in the future. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because it is a bit noisy. Around the 2nd or 3rd speed it sounds a little rough but at higher speeds it runs like a champ. Despite the noise, I think this was a great purchase. 
I have been using this Factory- Reconditioned Kitchen Aid for 100 days. I think that is the good thing with a strong power. It srand up very well, so I would like to recommend you to keep one in your kitchen. Furthermore, the price was very exciting. I got it about USD125 - Free shipping. 
This is a great mixer its a little loud but worth it for the power you get 
I'm delighted with my refurbished KitchenAid mixer...it's a delight to use, and the first stand mixer I've owned. I'll never buy a brand new KitchenAid again 
Why didn't I buy a Kitchenaid 20 years ago? Last night I made meatloaf. It took exactly 5 minutes to prepare it. I used it to mix lefse (Norwegian) for Christmas. I use it for cookies. This is the bare bones version, but if you wait for a 40% off coupon at Linens Things or Bed, Bath, and Beyond you can get accessories at a reasonable price. Great 
Although I have only used the mixer a total of 7 times since my purchase I am pleased with its performance. A friend who visited at Thanksgiving said hers is much quieter and that mine sounds like it has a loose bearing. Oh well. All I know is that it works for me. I am pleased with my purchase 
I LOVE these screens because they do SO MUCH MORE than pizza. YUP, I'm a multi-task gadget junkie and these fit the requirements. Use them for a "splatter screen" when pan frying, roast nuts, make croutons or bruchetta and of course.... pizza crust is done from underside like it should be 
I'm writing this review mostly because of OldAmazonian's complaint that the foam pad is made by Leggett and Platt. I don't own this particular size serta pad, although I have recently purchased a 1.5 inch version (in the 3 pound weight), and it too came in a rather generic and unmarked bag. However, all (or almost all) of Serta's foam products are made by Leggett and Platt!!! And Leggett and Platt supplies serta with much of the materials that go into their mattresses too. So in essence, a Serta foam pad IS a Leggett and Platt foam pad! Serta doesn't make foam themselves, they simply market the foam products that Leggett and Platt makes. So no, the pad probably won't come in pretty Serta packaging, but it's made by the same company that any Serta foam product is probably made by. My guess is that Serta is doing "marketing" in selling it for Leggett and Platt as a Serta product here 
Overall my girlfriend and I are both happy with this topper. We'll be combining furniture and households in the near future, retaining her bed, so I needed a temporary solution to my aging mattress before that happens. Thankfully this topper has provided it, and my girlfriend (who hated my old mattress) has slept more soundly and comfortably since the first night. The first few nights I found it very uncomfortable and woke with pain in my lower back and hips, but after about three nights my body adjusted I found that I much prefer sleeping with the topper than without. I've spent some time on Tempur-pedic beds, and the topper feels close to Tempur-pedic, but not quite. I feel that when the topper is placed in its protective slipcover, and then my bedsheet is place over that, the memory-foam-ness of it is diminished, and it doesnt feel dramatically different from the old egg-crate style of foam toppers that have been around for years. As far as some other concerns go: I did not find the rubber smell to be overpowering, but it was noticeable for the first night or two, now the smell is non-existant. Also, I live in Florida and I was concerned about the topper holding and radiating too much heat, thankfully this is not the case, and the topper provides a comfortable sleeping temperature. Finally, I had to cut 7 inches off the width of it to get the Queen sized topper to fit on my Full sized bed. A Full sized topper would have been too narrow and considerably too short. It may cost a little more but I recommend going a size larger and cutting down to what you need. Cutting the topper was very easy with a yardstick and an ordinary pair of sharp scissors, and I've seen no crumbling or fraying from where I cut. Bottom line: do I feel like I'm sleeping on a Tempur-pedic brand mattress?, No, not really. But I am enjoying a more comfortable sleep, and I don't regret the purchase at all. Oh, and the look on your cats faces when they jump on it the first time is worth the price alone! :-) 
I have collected all of Le Creuset's fruit and vegetable shaped cast iron enameled casseroles. They are beautiful to display on a table or on a kitchen counter and very practical in cooking great casseroles. The color that they can add to a kitchen brightens every vist there. The exterior and interior enamel coating is very durable and easy to clean. I have cooked a multitude of dishes in these casseroles and have found them to be excellent in heat conduction and preventing "hot spots". The comments of guests served from these casseroles is always positive and never fails to bring a smile to my face. There is a drawback to these whimsical cookers and that is the rim of both the top and bottom of the casseroles. There is no enamel on these rims and they can rust if not dried immediately after hand washing. They are dishwasher safe but I do recommend that you hand wash and dry immediately. I also recommend that you let them sit out for an hour or so to air dry before storing them. When wet this casserole can be very slippery and the handles on the bottom and top help in preventing dropping them. Finally, closely inspect your casserole when it arrives. My first garlic casserole had a two inch crack in the enamel. Amazon.com immediately sent a replacement to me and had the defective item picked up at my home at no charge. I commend them for standing behind the products they sell 
Your charges on shipping make it stupid to order from yo 
In an attempt to get RED coffee mugs, I ordered two "cinnibar" Fiestaware coffee mugs. While they are in the red family, the color has too much brown in it for me. I wish Fiestaware would produce a true red shade. Other than that,they were fine. Price reduction didn't mean much once the s were added. Could have driven to the store, paid regular price and still gotten them for less. My fault for being lazy 
If you've bought Fiestaware place settings in the past, you've surely noticed the awkward shape of the coffee mugs of yore. The old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably. While the art deco design is lovely, using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting "morning coffee" experience we've come to expect from no-nonsense diner mugs. Anyway, Fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle... and it's a realistic size, too, not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee. Yay for the Java Mug 
I would like to know where are these pots and pans made. I have one Revere pan that was made in China and it does not set flat on my stove. Before I place an order I want to be sure that I am receiving the best product 
I've had my Revere pots and pans for years and they've been great. They're stainless steel with copper bottoms so they heat up more evenly than aluminum. Everything looks good and fits together right. I even have a 10 quart Revere pot that I use for boiling lasagna noodles! What more can you ask? 
I bought this cookware for my mom and it is working out well for her. 
i've had my revere 1400 set for about a month now. it takes a bit of time to get used to cooking at the lower temps. it cooks well evenly. easy to clean even if you burn something. couldn't be happier 
I have been so impressed with this set. It all cooks great. I think the frying pan would cook best with a gas stove. I love the mixing bowls that came with the set. It is a VERY good buy 
All the bad reviews on the Revere pots and pans are totally off base. The newer Revere pots and pans are not excactly like the ones made 40 years ago in Clinton Illinois, BUT this cookware is wonderful. I love the light weight, it making cooking easier, also the taste of the food using these pot and pans is worth the puchase. I am so impressed with my set that I bought on Amazon, and the Amazon price was great. I've used froo froo pots and pans, heavy in weight, and they did not cook my food as well as the Revere! 
I returned the set, it was not the quality of the Revere Ware I'm accustomed to. I have some Revere Ware that is 30+ years old and it's night and day to this new stuff. I instead purchased a used older set at auction, which was cheaper and is heavier and much higher quality and made in the USA, not Indonesia as the new set was. Disappointing too, that I had to pay shipping both ways, as they back-charge you the shipping for the initial "free shipping" as well as the return shipping. 
This is a great set. You get a lot of cookware for a decent price. Revere Ware lasts, this was to add on to a set my mother bought me when I moved into my first apartment 10 years ago. The only diffence between my original set and the new one, my origianl set was made in Ohio, now they manufacture in Asia. The metal is a little thiner and lighter, but all in all I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this set to any person looking for a quality cookware set that isn't 'non-stick' 
Before Revereware came in sets, you could only buy it open stock in better department stores. When I was 19, my Dad bought 5 sauce pans, 2 fry pans and a dutch oven with lids for each. He said at the time, "Here you go, these will last the rest of your life." That was forty years ago. In that time I have packed my Revereware back and forth across the country three times. Cooked with them on gas and electric ranges, on camp stoves and over camp fires. The cookware is still good, no hot spots, no warping and the copper still shines, it is going to outlast me. I have added to the original cookware my Dad bought over the years, but I have to buy used Revereware to get the heavier pots with the thicker copper bottom. To get these I go by the trademark on the bottom of the pans, mine has 1801 with Paul Revere in profile. A newer lighter (cheaper?) version has a patent number and something about process. 
This is THE WORST vacuum we have ever had. It doesn't pick up pet hair - what the heck? It doesn't do bare floors, it sucks up and chews up persian rugs, it is self propelled? You have got to be kidding me! I have to push this thing harder than any vacuum ever. I went to Wal Mart and Lowes to get a new belt for it, this is the 4th belt we have gone through in one year and neither places have it. Now what? It is a very heavy vacuum. Bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya. It is by far the loudest vacuum there is, a super loud droning sound that sends the animals wild each time you turn it on. In a small room it is absolutely deafening! I hate it, I do not recommend it. If someone on here does - they are lying to you! This is the worst vacuum we have owned. I can visibly see dust and dirt SHOOT out the back when I vacuum (even after cleaning it out) so much for the Hepa filter!!! Don't buy this vacuum, you will want to throw it through a window like I do and even my husband wants to do!! 
The dirt devil vision self propelled is the best vacuum in the world for carpets not bare floors it does a loisy job on bare floors. it is better then any dyson or any hoover or the expensive kirbyvacc. You ask why. Why indeed. First of all You probably gotsucked or suckered into believing that suction is the most important thing in a vacuum Right . No im afraid not. Its all in the beater bar brush, the faster it goes the better it will clean your carpets all the so called suction does is remove what the beater bar brush pulls out. yes the better the suction the faster it gets rid of what the brush pulls up. Mr dyson seems to think that suction is all that matters its not. dyson vacuums are poor on rugs becausethefloatingheadon them doesnt get down far enough to get the really deep down dirt like the dirtdevil vision self propelled .Also, an important thing is having a solid line of brush on the beater bar.the others like dyson or hoover well theyvegot gaps in there brushes why, who knows maybe they think there is better air movement or something.cosumer rates that the hoover windtunnel self propelled is the best vacuuminthere tests.well i have that model too and yes it does do a good job but it doesntdeep clean like the dirt devil. the drive belts also burn outreally quick so its hard to push and pull. the cons of the dirt devil vision are this.yes its noisy yes its bad on bare floors yes you have to clean the filter ihappento clean mine with another vaccum or i use my air compressor to blow it off. i have a very big house and have tested vacuums for years i have a dyson dc14 animal a hoover windtunnel and a kirby.by the way the selfpropelled motor doesntuse a belt like hoovers windtunnel. i tell you folks for carpets its the best.Ivehad it for 3years the hoover for 3years and the dyson for 3months and the kirby for a 1year You will find that nothing pulls out more then that machine. nothing. for the money u can buy a dirtdevil vision at your local walmart for 98.00 pretty cheep the design is one of the best easy to empty dirt container the self propelled feature is much better then the hoovers windtunnel. Why these other reviewers say the belts burn out fast is beyond me i vacuum every day or everyother day because i have pets and my wife has got allergies. just to let you know the dyson is a good machine but dosnt have the power a dirt devil has you turn that dirt devil on and you can feel the floor just vibrate and you can hear that beater bar just going like crazy on the floor. If you buy one youll be in a shock as to what youll pull out of your carpets. and people, this vac like most other bagless vacs have filters of some sort. They do have to be cleaned now and then, the dirt devils suction is very good and it doesnt lose suction very fast . the only way it ever would is if you never clean the damn thing. thats the price people that you pay for bagless vacs. Clean the filter once a week or every two weeks depending on how much you use it again i use mine almost everyday and i clean the filter once a week. if you never clean the filter you know it probably would do a poor job. after seeing the other reviews im very interested in finding out how theres seem to be falling apart or not running very well. ive owned mine for 3years and never had any problems, yes ive changed the belt on it and have bought a new filter for it now and then but, im wondering why these other people are having such difficulty. folks the vac is like anything , if you take care of it, it will last. i mean the things got one belt and one filter how hard is that. i suppose if you beat the hell out of it, i suppose it could brake. dum da dum dum dumm 
Pros: Bagless, works well at first Cons: Breaks down frequently, the tubes often become blocked despite emptying of the canister in a timely manner, burning rubber smell, and had to replace the belt-twice. Right now my vacuum is sitting in the middle of the living room. I want to vacuum, but I can't. It is broken-again! It isn't as if I use it all that often, so to have it break down so much is quite frustrating. Don't waste your money on this cleaner. 
this design was flawed. I mean it was sorry. You lose suction. there is too much cording at the bottom. I had to use a coat hanger. It is noisy.It is very unreliable. 
Before I bought a Dirt Devil, I owned a vacuum that worked great for over 5 years. In January I broke that vacuum on a Friday the 13th (yes, that really is a bad day) thanks to me accidentally ramming the front of it into the side of the living room coffee table. After it hit the table I knew immediately it was a goner. Sometimes you just know. Also, the electrical smoke shooting out the front was another good indication. No one to blame but me. It actually upset me because, before that innocent, everyone in my house kept accusing me of knocking a big dent into the side of the dishwasher in the kitchen. I really believe I didn't put that dent there, and I tried hard to defend myself every time that topic came up, but now I look incredibly guilty because of the way I knocked the vacuum into the coffee table and ruined it. I'm an innocent man! I DID NOT BANG THE VACUUM INTO THE DISHWASHER! And the worst part about that vacuum breaking was that I was actually DONE cleaning the floors before it broke, and so I shut the vacuum off, but then (and this will bother me forever) I looked down on the carpet and realized that I had missed a spot near the coffee table, so I turn the vacuum back on and THEN I accidentally hit the coffee table and destroyed the vacuum. If I had never bothered with that spot on the floor the vacuum probably would continue to run fine today. A mistake I have to live with. After it was discovered that we couldn't save the vacuum cleaner, we went somewhere to get another one (actually I stayed home while my dad shopped around). For years we saw commercials for Dirt Devils and figured they would be a very wise purchase. Well, that turned out to be not entirely true, but in another way, it WAS entirely true. Let me try to explain why I think this is a good vacuum cleaner. I have to warn you- it's kind of mind-boggling. The one big complaint people seem to have with Dirt Devils also happened to me- one time I was vacuuming, and I left it running while I was busy trying to arrange the dog beds across the floor in a way I could easily vacuum over them. Well, while I was doing that the vacuum was positioned on top of the cord, and so it accidentally sucked up the cord, made a big scary noise, and damaged it. I immediately ran over and unplugged it. I had to wrap electrical tape around the spot on the cord that was damaged because the wires inside were exposed. This happened after the second week we purchased it, and I thought I was going to freak out because I thought I had just ruined a brand new vacuum. It turned out to be okay. Truly a scary moment. That was a sign to just take the dog beds outside for now on and shake the hair off myself. I like how Dirt Devil vacuums have a plastic case design to hold the dirt and hair, instead of messing with those darn vacuum bags. Vacuum bags are a pain in the butt because not all types are designed the same. For instance, one time I bought a 3-pack bag of vacuum bags that had a round hole on top of the bag, but the inside of my vacuum at home required bags with a SQUARE hole, so we had to go back to the store and search for vacuum bags that were created with square-shaped holes instead of round-shaped holes, so it would fit inside my vacuum. A big, unnecessary pain. ALL BAGS SHOULD HAVE EITHER ROUND OR SQUARE HOLES, NOT BOTH. Anyway, with the Dirt Devils plastic container design, you can simply push a button to remove the container from the vacuum cleaner and empty the dirt and hair into your trashcan/front yard, and use a brush to wipe away any sticky remains. No bags needed. This is convenient, but if there's one complaint it's that the container fills up after vacuuming the entire downstairs after only ONE time (this includes the kitchen, living room and den floors- but I DO have a big house). As I mention above, something very strange is going on with my Dirt Devil. When I first bought the vacuum back in January I thought the sucking power was sort of weak, and I had to go over certain areas on my carpet three or four times to completely clean it. However, as the weeks went by, the sucking power gradually increased to where now I'm afraid to leave the vacuum turned on over any kind of loose rugs, for fear that the vacuum cleaner will suck the rug right off the floor. I have no idea where this sudden burst of amazing power came from, and why it's getting stronger as time goes on. I don't know if I'm happy about it either. I think I am. You just have to be careful not to leave the vacuum running over any kind of rug or doormat. All I hope for is that my Dirt Devil vacuum lasts me until the end of this year. I can't handle the frustration of buying vacuum after vacuum not ONLY because of a money issue, but also because you know how people can be- they will continue to say *I* destroyed my vacuums by accusing me of being exceptionally harsh with them- accusing me of pushing around my vacuums aggressively and angrily, banging into the side of everything I come into contact with. I'm really not the kind of person that does that. These people can just knock it off. Okay, sometimes I break out into hives and get extremely itchy, and during these moments it's hard to push the vacuum around calmly and carefully. But I've learned to just shut the vacuum off and wait for the itching to go away before starting it back up again. So there's really not much for me to complain about when it comes to Dirt Devils. Okay, so sometimes if you vacuum over cracker crumbs or something the crumbs will shoot back and hit your leg. But please, don't tell me that actually hurts you. It's doing that because the vacuum is so damn powerful. It can't help it! It's a great vacuum for dog hair. On hard floors, the Dirt Devil is a pretty quick and wonderful experience, too. Dog hair is gone in an instant. The noise of the motor is louder than most, this is true. That's a slight problem. But I only need to vacuum once a week so it's not like I have to hear the thing running everyday. The noise would probably become a problem then. But in the end, my experience for the last three months with the Dirt Devil has been a good one. 
there...I think my title best describes how I feel about this piece of junk! Read all the reviews..I have the same complaints...from the cord up to the handle. this vacuum leaves me cussing every time I use it. And I am not that kind of person but this just brings out the worst in me. I especially love cleaning my house but ever since I got this vacuum, I dread the day I had to clean my house, knowing how painful and horrible it will be. I should have bought Hoover instead. My last Hoover lasted 11 years before I had to buy this garbage. Hoover may be a bit pricey but it sure as hell's worth it 
My wife and I received this vacuum as a wedding gift. Before we even celebrated our 2 year anniversary, the vacuum had completely fallen apart. It won't stand up on its own, 2 screws have fallen out of the base, the house smells like burnt rubber every time we use it, I have to use the attachments to suck up anything bigger than a cat hair, and the plastic guard on the front is completely detached. Furthermore, everytime we vaccum, the HEPA filter trap opens, and I have to put it back together before I can resume. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one whose had these problems. I didn't pay for the thing, but if you're planning on it, my suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM. You'll be shopping for another one within 2 years just like me. 
Besides looking nice when hung from a pot rack, this big pot heats up quickly, cooks food effectively, allows for metal utensils to be used, and is simple to clean. I especially like the long handle on one end and the short handle on the other - makes maneuvering easy. It is a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it 
Tricky trying to find the perfect window treatment from a pic online. But I cannot emphasize more strongly how delighted I was to receive this item (in a smaller size) from this fantastic seller. Not only did it arrive promptly but it was absolutely perfectly consistent with the description online and the terrific photo as well. If you want to soften a window and the room as well for a great price - go for it. You will not be disappointed from my experience. Thanks ever to this seller - we love a bargain and getting exactly what we pay for 
Good sturdy pan. Handle stays cool to the touch. Easy to clean. Nice, even cooking. Not too heavy. Lid seals well. I have the 5 Quart too and recommend that one as well. If I'm cooking, one or the other of them is sure to be in use. 
If you want to spend this much money for a slicer, go ahead and buy this machine! I use it for almost two years now. It's not so hard to clean as described by a previous reviewer.I simply sponge each side of the blade with a bleach/water solution after each use and i had the blade removed only a couple of times. If you go out to eat you have a much better chance to catch foodpoisoning. Certainly not from this machine 
We've been using it now for about four months with out a problem. It works well on breads, meats and cheese. Contrary to the previous comment the unit is easy to clean and, in my opinion. (some people wash there hands 50 times a day too!) I would recommend this unit to all who wish a rugged and dependable product 
I'm very pleased with this slicer. Shaves ham and slices bread. Cheddar cheese doesn't slow the motor down in the least. Nicely designed. Easy to clean, it takes less than 10 minutes to disassemble, wash and re-assemble. It fits on the kitchen counter and is good looking. Highly recommended 
This is the Lexus of the bottle opener world! Very heavy duty, lovely stainless steel business end and pretty, shiny handle in the color of your choice! What more could you want? This is a substantial piece of equipment- won't get lost in the crowded utensil drawer. This is not a space-saving item! So don't get it if you are short on utensil space! This opener has considerable heft and grabs hold of bottle tops easily. If you want your bottle top popped, this would be the one to go with 
This is a great bottle opener....strong, sturdy, and only $3.96 everyday at Walmart. It'd do you good to pick it up there, rather than spend nearly $10 here. 
I think you could do just about anything to this bottle opener and it would come out just fine. As noted by other reviewers, this opener has a wonderful substantial weight. It has Kitchenaid's signature quality and great color! Goes well with my other utencils and gadgets. Oh, it opens bottles very well too 
Yes, yet another fan of this bottle opener. I bought a blue one and a red one. I'll never go back to the cheap-o kind again! Works like a charm and feels great in your hand. I'm very pleased 
This is a great bottle opener because it is deceivingly heavy and sturdy and I actually prefer non-twist off beer bottles now simply so I can use my trusty bottle opener. I plan on buying more to give as gifts because it makes a perfect accessory to a house-warming gift 
I love this bottle opener and would buy another if needed, without question. It is very heavy compared to other openers, which makes it all the more durable. I love Kitchenaid products 
OH YEAH! I love this can opener. It's the greatest, I tie two of them together with a piece of rope to make nunchucks out of them! HA YAA 
This is probably the sturdiest bottle opener I've ever used. It opens pretty much any bottle with ease, and leverage is easy due to its bulk and size. You probably won't ever lose it, either, since it's so big. It's definitely not for travel because of its weight, so you'll want something else if you plan to bring a bottle opener to picnics or camping trips 
Don't get all excited, it is just a bottle opener. You get what you pay for, this one is high quality, and more expensive. If you are a KitchenAid nut, this one is great for you. If not, it is an expensive bottle opener 
I was looking for a long time for a mixer that seemed like a good quality. I did buy one from the store but it was not high enough quality to suit my needs.The online reviews were a big help so I thought I would share mine. I bought one,pistachio hoping it was not to ugly,not knowing what the picture looked like.(I sent 2 pics but they still are not quite right)It was perfect for me more like an old time mint color.I received it only 6 days after I ordered it.It is heavy and seems well put together.I am very picky about quality, which seems hard to find.I ran it through a test of 8 cups whole wheat for bread.The only small problem I had is the bowl seemed to tilt.After taking it out I noticed there is a clip on back where the bowl had to pushed into a little to fit level.Easy enough.It made the dough and kneaded it with little effort.I am impressed with the power.I like the bowl lift design.I is a little loud, but no more than I would expect for a powerful motor.The only thing I don't know at this point is i will last or not.My impression is that it will.The overall quality seems excellent.I would say it is well worth the money if want something with enough power to get the job done 
This product meets any expectations I had for a stand mixer. Previously I was using a hand mixer for nearly all needs, and have found the Kitchenaid to make the task so much easier. Hands free operation is wonderful. Clean up is easy, and it has enough power to mix a large batch of cookie dough! 
This is a great mixer-I don't know how I lived without it. Baking is much more fun now. 
This new one replaced one I had a long time. You just can't beat KitchenAid~! They're workhorses and the one I bought is the Cadillac~!! Luvvit, luvvit, luvvit~!! Buyit, buyit, buyit~!! ;+) 
I grew up having a KitchenAid in my home so I knew I always wanted one. Every Sunday we made several batches of cookies. We were kids so we were pretty hard on it. My mom still has hers and the only thing that needs replacing is the beater that has been well used so no wonder it's a little shabby looking. I was willing to just get the white 4 quart but once my husband got in on the decision we had to have the lift handle. It's nice that I don't have to pull the mixer out to be able to lift the top of the mixer. Most people I know say this isn't a big inconvenience. My husband didn't like the look of the white and worried it would look dirty. We got the Imperial gray and I really like it. It's nice having the 6 quart bowl even though it seems a little excessive most of the time except for when we need a ton of cookies at once. You know a real emergency. It mixes everything so evenly and I like not having to worry about my cookies turning out. My sister in-law got one recently and still doesn't use it much because she isn't used to having it. I find lots of little ways to use it to make cooking and baking easier. My son says it looks like a robot and he is sure it's a boy. He has three sisters and no brothers. The kids ask me every night if I made the dinner in the KitchenAid and if I say yes they go on and on about how good the dinner is. It only took 10 years of marriage to convince my husband it would be a good investment. He is sold, he loves it too. I almost have him convinced to start baking. I wish I had gotten it ten years ago. I wouldn't let small children use it unattended. As teenagers we thoughtlessly broke several wooden spoons in the mixer because we thought we could get around the beater. That always made my mom so mad. HeHe. I look forward to buying the attachments. I just bought a wheat grinder last year and I am thinking of selling it and getting the wheat grinder attachment instead. If you buy it and use it you will love it, but like any other handy appliance it's a waste of money if you just let it sit there. If you like to bake it's a must have. 
I never received this mixer. I ordered it in good faith and was told it was in stock-what happened? Did you sell it to someone else 
This has been the perfect purchase for my baking and cake decorating needs. I can't believe what a great job it does in mixing my decorators frosting. clean up is so easy 
I have wanted this kitchenaid for years now. It was just a bit out of my price range but through amazon I was able to afford it, and the service was fast...we did have to return our first mixer b/c it was damaged in shipping, but amazon quickly sent us out a new one. Now I have the best mixer on the planet! - I love this machine, my sister has had her mixer for over 5 years without a problem...and let me tell you we COOK alot! This is well worth the money! Kitchenaid is top of the line in product and customer service 
I bought the Kitchenaid for my husband who has been whining for one for 5 years. He loves it. Amazon shipped it fast, we havent had a problem with it and he uses it for everything. I highly recommend it 
Firstly, gotta love T-fal's non-stick surfaces which are really durable and easy to clean. The colours on this range are really vibrant and can liven up your otherwise bland kitchen space. The combination of these 2 pans really make it a pleasure to cook up a storm 
My husband and I are wine lovers and have accumulated several types of corkscrews over the years but were never quite satisfied with any of them. This corkscrew is really easy and effective - it holds up to any corkscrew that we have had for a fraction of the price and no complication 
This corkscrew is easy to use and will avoid breaking the cork thanks to it's two stages. You can find the same model here at Amazon far cheaper via Target 
The double step levered corkscrew is a great improvement over a single step pull. I first saw this in Spain (where the Pulltap is made) and knew I had to have one. Strongly recommend this item. They come in at least two sizes; slightly longer handle. Most descriptions aren't very good 
This works great and priced regularly at $7.99 at Beverages and More (was on sale for $5.99). The easiest corkscrew I ever used was the pocket screwpull which doesn't seem to be produced anymore, just the table model. 
I am not a waiter that serves wine, an overseas traveler, or a wine expert. I am just a Joe Schmo that was looking for a corkscrew. I read the reviews on Amazon, and noticed this item had an average customer rating of 5 stars. Boy, were these customers on the money. I bought this rascal and am absolutely amazed that such a simply constructed tool can be so efficient. It works great. All the other fancy schmancy corkscrews may be cool to look at, or lend some self-prestige to the owner. Whatever, blows your skirt. This baby is all anyone needs to open a bottle of wine and enjoy it. Although I enjoy and trust shopping on Amazon, readers should note that this item is available at some stores for $10 
I have prettier, bigger, and more expenseive wine openers but none of them match this Pulltap for being easy to use. The two stage design for removing the cork is genius. I've never broken a cork or struggled to break loose a particularly tough cork when using this Pulltap. I hate to part with some of my fancy (and expensive) corkscrews, but the truth is that when I want to open wine easily and quickly... this is the tool I go to every time. I give this one my highest recommentation. 
We were just at the wine festival in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, and almost ALL of the wineries had this type of corkscrew available for sale for $10.00 (Canadian) or less. Now I'm wishing we had bought one up there! The blade was a sharp little one-inch regular knife blade, though, not a serrated blade as shown. They were very nice, well made, and heavy for the size 
As a server in an Italian restaurant, I have to open a plethora of wine bottles in front of customers. Based on experience with many different corkscrews, this is by far the easiest to use. It is one of the fastest and smoothest of any corkscrew I have experienced. I have, however, seen it other places for much cheaper than here 
I dont honestly know where I first found mine, but I fell in love with it immediately. You never have to struggle with the cork. My parents recently discovered a love for wine and as a gift I was going to get them one of these. Well to my suprise, there is not a single shop in a 100 mile radius that carries this. Everyone still uses the one step approach or worse yet, the auger approach. Five stars all the way 
This is the best, easiest waiter's corkscrew I've ever used. My only qualm is that I've seen it offered for much cheaper than $19.99. 
After having purchased several other Oxo products, naturally when I saw this I had to have it. Performs well and stylish. A loyal Oxo fan 
I had this white plastic portable paper towel holder I loved and I had it for about 20 years -- I'd never seen another one like it. It was perfect for my apartment. It fit nicely on top of my refrigerator and in my small kitchen, there really isn't any place for an under-cabinet mounted paper towel holder. Then, one day, I knocked the thing off the top of the fridge and a piece broke off. This stainless and black plastic OXO Goodgrips Grip and Rip is close to the one I broke and better, actually. The brushed stainless body of it looks great. It has enough weight to stay put. The rubber ring on its bottom grips the countertop and leaves no marks of any kind. The bottom of the unit has a slightly raised rim to keep the towels from unwinding on their own, and unlike another unit I considered, the base isn't larger than it needs to be -- yet it will hold the large-sized roll of towels as well as the smaller standard size. What I really like about it is the fact that the whole unit rotates on a bearing when you pull towels off. You can put your hand flat on top of the knob to steady it, and the stainless top of the knob allows the unit to rotate underneath it. When you've unrolled just the number of towels you want to tear off, you only need to grip the clingy rubber underside of the knob with your hand and the unit won't turn so you can tear off the towels. To refill, just press the black button top center on the knob and it comes off so you can remove the empty carboard tube and slip on a new roll. The knob snaps easily into place again. Couldn't be simpler and couldn't work better. And it fits into the limited space I have on top of the fridge. Seriously, I have to hand it to OXO Good Grips -- their products are typically excellent and this one is, too 
I like the look and the length of this mitt. The only drawback is that if you have to hold something hot for longer than 2 or 3 seconds, you really start to feel the heat. For the price, I expected it to protect better 
I was looking for a tea kettle for my sister for Christmas and couldn't find one anywhere. Finally I tried Amazon and came up with a new problem, which one to choose. Amazon had a wide variety of items to choose from. Their prices were excellent and with their Super Saver shipping, I saved a lot of money shopping online versus a store. The kettle came very fast and was everything I wanted it to be. It's not some cheap, flimsy tea kettle but the real deal. My sister loved it. I would definitely recomment using Amazon for anything you're looking for. The prices are great and you can't beat the convenience 
AWESOME MOP. THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD. WORTH EVERY PENNY. REALLY CLEANS THE FLOORS GREAT. 
This mop is amazing. No stinky chemicals and I have REALLY REALLY clean floors. My husband read a bunch of reviews and bought the map based on those reviews. We have gone through several mops in the past few years, because they couldn't hold up to a household with 5 cats. I have had standard mops, the "fancy" kinds from the grocery store, and every other mop out there. But this one works. I have had this mop for only a few days, but I am so impressed. I am beyond impressed. 
I was very dubious about the glowing reviews that this product received from other buyers, but I bought one anyway, despite what seemed to be a rather hefty price tag for a mop. Well, you can now count me as a true believer. This is a great product! It is very sturdy, well manufactured, and built for years of service, yet during use it feels like half the weight of a traditional cotton head mop. When other reviewers say it does a great job of cleaning your floors they are not exaggerating. To top it all, it couldn't be easier to keep clean; just toss the easily removable mop head into the washing machine. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed or regretting the purchase of this fine product. Don't let the cost scare you away. This is truly a very pleasant exception to the cornucopia of third-world junk littering today's marketplace. P.S. My friends tell me that I am always hypercritical and NOT a person who is easily pleased 
This is the most effective and easiest mop I've ever used! It effortlessly glides along while cleaning. It's perfect for the environment, too- I love not having to keep buying replacement cleaning supplies and just using water; no chemicals! It's more sturdy than the cheaper ones; not flimsy at all. I will always use it- it can't get any easier than this 
This mop does an excellent job, just with plain water. I think it is easier two have two that you can rinse at a time, so it goes quicker. I am impressed with how much dirt it pulls from linoleum. It glides easily, and rubs off hard spots. I highly recommend it, as well as the dust mop 
This mop is the best I have purchased. We have ceramic tiles and they are a little difficult to get into the grout areas. This mop works great and turns into every nook and cranny. My daughter told me of this mop.... she loves hers 
I ordered two of these .... one for a friend and one for myself. My first one just died after the first use. Amazon was wonderful about replacing the unit (Fast delivery, no problems with return!) and I've been a happy waffle-maker ever since. This is a great machine 
This waffler makes some great waffles. No need to go to go the restaurant anymore for waffles 
I bought one of these wafflers after doing more research than the subject warrants, I'm sure. My local mom carry this line so I purchased it from them. The first waffler wouldn't heat up out of the box so I exchanged it - so far so good with the replacement. This would be a 5-star review if the first unit had worked and if the "Belgian Waffle" recipe wasn't such a waste of supplies. First trial using the recipe booklet's recipe for "Belgian waffles" produced some rather inedible results. Even my son the Hoover Vacuum thought they weren't very nice: the finished waffles were pale and spongy despite being baked at a thermostat setting of 6. Second trial run using my tried and true "Joy of Cooking" basic waffle produced well-baked if heavy waffles: crispy outsides, tender insides. The vacuum pronounced them fit to eat and proceeded to tuck away 6 segments or 1.5 total waffles. This morning's recipe used a modified buttermilk waffle recipe from "JoC". The results were light and crispy, well-browned, crispy on the outside, tender and airy on the inside. My son got around two entire waffles. Modified recipe: Separate 3 eggs, melt a stick of butter. Whisk the yolks with 1.5c buttermilk. Toss together 1.5c flour, .5c cornstarch, 1.5t baking powder, .25t baking soda, pinch salt, optional 1T sugar. Beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry. Using a spatula quickly stir the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture, then quickly add the melted butter and stir until the batter is mostly smooth. Fold in eggwhites. Make waffles 
I've owned any number of VillaWare products in the past and have always been happy with their quality and longevity. This product has not lived up to that reputation - the heating element has failed on this unit after only about 6 uses in 2 months. 
When my husband and I first got our waffle maker, we couldn't believe how well it worked - at this price point, nothing could be better. A couple of months ago the lock that holds the waffle plate upright while you're pouring batter and removing the waffle broke in the middle of using the waffle maker. It slipped to the side and burnt the inside of my arm. Three months later, I still have a scar and I can no longer in any way recommend this waffle maker. I'm going to purchase something slightly more expensive (e.g., KitchenAid) that hopefully has more of a focus on ensuring that parts continue to work. If you do choose to buy this, BE CAREFUL 
The waffler works great. Effective for those who multi-task. The bell reminds me when to add batter or when I must remove a waffle. The box mixes come out o.k. but more tough. The yeast recipe tastes "yeasty". I recommend a recipe with whipped whites, lemon juice and cornstarch for lightness. Freeze well.....Add a little more sugar and vanilla for kid friendly waffles. A great way to wake up kids in the morning on a busy day 
This wafflemaker is very easy to use, idiot-proof, and makes perfect, crisp Belgian waffles. The recipe that came with the wafflemaker is particularly good. Waffler lets you know when to start cooking and when to stop. If you follow the instructions you get great waffles that don't stick. 
Makes perfect waffles and we have no complaints so far. Big fluffy waffles, 1.5 inches versus the regular 1.25 inch waffle makers 
Yes, like the other reviewers say, it works just as you'd want it to work. I do have a few nits to pick (and hence the four stars) that I don't recall anyone else mentioning: - The cord is really short. I suppose it's designed that way so it can be stored in the base, but it only extends 29" from the base. May or may not be a problem for you depending on where your outlets are. - The temperature adjustment knob feels really cheap. A friend of mine said it feels like it isn't attached to anything. I agree, but in fact it is. I just hope it's more durable than it feels. - Unlike the Waring Pro WMK300, this has no spill tray. The plastic base is just bowl-shaped to contain spills and crumbs. I didn't really have any spills, but a removable tray would be nicer (if not as attractive). - Made in China. Not that I'm opposed to China getting my money, but until China does more to protect its workers and environment I prefer my money go to countries that do better on those fronts. Just my $0.02. The description is incorrect. The waffles are 6.5" across the top and 7" across the middle. My favorite topping so far is sliced frozen strawberries (thawed, of course) and fresh real whipped cream. elena lisa: I followed the instructions to apply oil with a pastry brush and never had a stuck waffle. Personally, I hate aerosol cooking sprays. They work, but: - It's impossible to confine the fine mist they produce to the cooking surface and I rarely want to oil my stove or counter top. - According to Calphalon they use a propellant that can make cookware harder to clean. I can't confirm the latter but I know that they get an oil film on things I don't want oiled 
I purchased this waffle maker in early December as a gift for my husband, who was on a quest for the perfect waffle. Right out of the box it made the thick fluffy waffles we were hoping it would make. They were a full 1 1/2" thick, and crispy on the outside. We had found Waffle Perfection! I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that 3 weeks after we started using it, it quit heating up. However, since we had purchased it through Amazon.com, the Amazon.com customer service team really stepped up and we had a new waffle maker within a week. The new one is producing perfect waffles as well, going on 3 weeks now. We are hoping that it will continue for a very long time, and our first waffle maker just had a manufacturing defect 
This was delivered promptly, packaged well and looked exactly as I expected it to. The only downfall was that one of the beads was broken during shipping, but for my purposes it worked well. I suppose if I had been using it as a curtain, I would not have been pleased that there was a broken bead. However, it was just what I wanted 
This is a doorway curtain, not a window curtain. The spaces between the strands is exactly as shown. It's a décor accent, not a light blocking tool, and I assure you the one I have in my closet door way makes my room feel tropically stylish. Luv it. 
The color, detail, and quality of this set is just perfect. I love it and have receieve many compliments on it. I intend to purchase another set. Very happy with set,and the manner it was packed and shipped 
Everything arrived in great condition the set is wonderful! Even better than pictured it was a gift but I may need to order one for myself! 
I WANTED TO CHECK MY EMAIL BEFORE GOING ON LINE TO ORDER ANOTHER ROOSTER PASTA BOWL SET AND THIS REQUEST FOR A REVIEW WAS IN MY IN-BOX. MY HUSBAND BROKE ONE OF THE BOWLS THIS MORNING AND ASKED ME TO ORDER MORE BECAUSE HE LIKES THEM SO MUCH. I HAVE 2 SETS OF THE DINNERWARE AND A SET OF THE PASTA BOWLS AND WE LOVE THEM! THEY ARE TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
I'm very happy with this pasta set. It exactly matches the dinnerware set and the quality is great. The pasta bowl is HUGE! I am considering a second set to complete 8 place settings. The second pasta bowl would make an excellent salad bowl.. 
This blender is fabulous. Although pretty expensive, I wouldn't recommend anything else. My favorite feature of this blender is the blades. They are super heavy and thick, and they are not sharp as with other cheaper blenders. Secondly, there is no mistaking when the blender jar is placed correctly on the base because of the construction of the base of the jar. Lastly, the blender starts every cycle with a "stir" setting as to not throw food up into the lid. I would definetely recommend this blender as well as any other Kitchenaid product. It's worth the extra cash to own the best 
This is just what I was looking for. Thanks again for Amazon.com. You are the best ! 
The shot glass is for a bar and was marked in measurements. The price was right. It was a gift and was a perfect addition to a new bar 
This cutting board does a great job of staying in place while you chop, slice, or dice. The surface is soft enough to protect my cutlery, and after hundreds of trips through the dishwasher, the rubber is still tacky and no worse for wear. My only complaint is that the large handles make the board harder to store and wash. 
I never know what to do about cutting boards. My preference is wood, but the upkeep to keep them from warping and in good shape is too much for me. The thought of plastic flakes in my food creeps me out, but I'm too clumsy for glass. We bought this cutting board when we bought a new knife. We don't have a dishwasher and it is a little unwieldy for the sink. However, it is great for serving, and it actually fits across our sink, which is nice for say, washing green beans and putting them on the cutting board. We bought the smaller version and use it for everyday stuff. They have held up well so far, and the plastic is pretty tough. Recommended 
This cutting board is all that it is advertized to be. I liked mine so much that I went out and bought a smaller version. Being able to put the cutting board in the dishwasher makes this my favorite cutting board and one that I look forward to using on a daily basis. 
First I'd like to say that Lodge Logic is the greatest. No seasoning, could it get any better? This is a great little pan that does a wonderful job at making perfect little cornbread sticks. I've done them in the oven, as well as over coals and they've turned out fine every time (first time they stuck and broke when I took them out, but the pan still cleaned fine). The only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because it's not terribly practical. It'll only cook one small batch at a time (1 1/2 cups of cornmeal mix). However, if you want something really fun and different, this is it 
Saying these glasses are too small is a lot like complaining that shot glass aren't big enough. They're highballs. Bar glasses made to hold specific styles of drinks, (mojitos, singapore slings, cobblers, etc.) and they are the perfect size for that. Excellent quality 
It looks very elegant with 4/5 full of iced beverage in the sunny afternoon kitchen. It feels so good while holding the glass and chatting with friends. The distinguish quality has captured every guest in the house. The size is just right for such occasions 
I weigh flour for waffles and bread to a tenth of an ounce. As for the on-off-tare switch, it could be a little frustrating if you got one that's too touchy but mine works fine. No regrets 
This scale is a piece of junk! Every time I would put food on the scale and get a reading, after waiting a few minutes the number would change! Or I would weigh an apple once and get 6.0. I would weigh THE SAME APPLE again and get 6.2. I would weigh it again and get 5.8! It drove me crazy. Even when I would zero the scale out, after a few minutes it would show a negative number. I returned the first one and asked for a replacement. I thought it was just that particular scale. But the replacement scale did exactly the same thing. Argh 
I totally agree with the last review of this scale. By the time I weighed out the next ingredient to be added to the bowl on the scale, the display showed 8-16 grams more. I even delayed the time between adding ingredients hoping the scale would settle on a single weight. I tried using different types of bowls (plastic, glass, metal), but it made no difference. The buttons are inadequate. It is hard to discribe the button design because the right front edge of the scale is labeled ON OFF TARE. You may turn the scale OFF trying to TARE the weight of the last ingredient. This usually leads to a loud expletive. I purchased this scale based upon the good reviews this product had as well as the fact that this scale is from the same company that manufactures the most highly rated, but very expensive, scale I've found. However, based on what I know now, I would never recommend this scale to anyone. I guess I got what I paid for - a cheap scale. 
I've gotten into bread baking and many of the books recommend measuring ingredients by weight instead of volume so I bought this scale. It's very affordable and made by what I considered to be a good manufacturer. I didn't think, though, that I would meet a scale that is so temperamental and indecisive. I always place the scale on a level, flat surface but when I put something on it to be weighed, the readout fluctuates anywhere from tenths of an ounce to an ounce or two, going up or down and not really settling anywhere. I have to wait a minute for the scale to make up its mind about EXACTLY how much the object weighs. I probably should have gone to a brick-and-mortar store to check out the actual design of the scale before I placed my order. Instead of individual on/off and tare buttons, this scale has "on", "off", and "tare" marked on the front edge of the scale and you are supposed to press down on your function of choice and the edge kind of buckles down and activates hidden buttons inside the mechanism: Bear with me here, this is weird and hard to describe! And it doesn't work very well either. Sometimes, pushing down on "tare" turns the scale off. I don't know why they didn't opt for simple straightforward buttons for the functions, but there you go. The button that switches the scale between pounds/ounces to metric is on the bottom of the scale. While it doesn't particularly bother me, one time, I did want to weigh something in one system and switch to another (too lazy to bust out the old conversion formula) and I had to remove the item, turn the scale over, flip the switch, and start the weighing process again. I think I should have returned this and bought another model that would have made me happier. This was a lesson in buying gadgets without physically checking them out--this scale looks good on paper and has a very affordable price tag, but it's not the best digital scale out there. More than half the time, I don't feel like dealing with this wishy washy scale so I just measure out my ingredients by volume. Which, indeed, defeats the purpose of why I got this scale in the first place 
Again, despite what the first reviewer states this scales DOES display weight in tenths of an ounce. (Perhaps he/she had it set for weighing in grams?) I bought this as a postal scale for mailing letters and packages from my home and not for weighing food. A 10 lb scale of lesser quality for postal purposes sells for $70 at Office Depot. The only thing that would be nice is a "hold" function commonly found on a postal scale, but for the price and Swiss quality I can live without it 
I don't know what that other customer is talking about - this scale can weigh down to the .1 oz. I've used it for soap making for 3 years now, often times measuring in ounces, and it is very accurate, easy to use, and precise 
Please be advised that the description provided herein is misleading - they claim to measure within 0.1 oz increments, when in reality there is no decimal reading on this scale. It measures in 1 oz increments only 
I make lots of costumes, particularly period dresses, for theater productions, and when I finally got desperate for a steamer I went for this one based on these reviews on Amazon. Just wanted to say they did not lead me astray! It's perfect for both at home and on the road when I'm delivering the goods, and it's not given me a hiccup yet. Highly recommended 
It is a brutalistic, ugly appliance but it does the job well. Water well is visible, it's ergonomic, and makes just enough steam to finish three wool suits. Well, maybe more like two and a half. I was skeptical of the high price, but after much research, I'm convinced this is the best travel one available. Makes other travel steamers look worthless (and they are). Jiffy can charge such a high price because there is no worthy competition - nothing comes close 
Just used the steamer for the first time and was impressed with how well it got up to temperature. It produces a good amount of steam for dewrinkling clothes, but keep in mind this is for short term use i.e. you will have to refill several times if you need to do several articles of clothing. The reason I purchased this was to block sweater pannels after knitting. I will need to send this gem back because the instruction clearly specify that you must keep the steamer verticle i.e. you can't use this with your clothing article on a table. Your item must be hanging 
This light weight travel steamer has saved me many dollars. For the price of what I would have paid a hotel valet service to press my suitcase wrinkled clothes I could probably have room service breakfasts! The Esteam made quick work of the folds in a gabardine skirt, and spiffed up the collars of many a blouse and jacket. While Esteam has become a must-have for our travel, it has also become a standby at home. We do have the J-2000 which is great, but because of the easy maneuverability of the hand held steamer I find that we use it more often. Try as I might, a steam iron was leaving shiny spots on a taffeta skirt. The steamer smooths wrinkles with no trace whatsoever. There is a silk table skirt that we love but it was impossible to get it home from the cleaners unwrinkled - Esteam to the rescue. The uses we've found for it are countless. It's simply one of those household items we now wonder how we ever did without. We like the wide mouth on the water tank, which makes it easy to fill and the fact that we can use plain or distilled water. The handle is ergonomically friendly, and the nine foot cord allows us to move about as much as needed. Thanks to Jiffy Esteamer wrinkles are no longer a pressing issue for us 
Firstly, smallappliances.com provides a much better price on this product than amazon. Secondly, I write this review based on a 2-week holiday experience in which I utilized the steamer on a diurnal basis. Pros: sub- 5 minute warm up period; uses hard or soft water; compact and durable; does an adequate job of steaming dress slacks, trenchcoats, jeans, ties and dress slacks; 800 watts of output power (most powerful portable steamer out there); never clogs; lengthy power cord; straight-forward and easy instructions; steams vertically as well as horizontally (really!); and, balanced. Cons: goes through dihydra-monoxide quickly (which is a testimony of its steaming power and the limited water chamber); no on/off switch; only 4 steaming vents (bores); steaming head collects dirt and lint promptly easily; have to purchase plug converters separately (utterly stupid since this unit is designed for the traveler--it's always about $, $, $, $); and, aesthetically unattractive. Is it quicker and more efficient than a clothes iron? Are the results better than a clothes iron? In my humble opinion... sometimes yes, sometimes no. For trenchcoats, ties, suit coats, jackets and jeans--this steamer definitely has the edge. For dress slacks and dress shirts--the jury's still out. As it stands right now, I would have to say, "No." All in all, it is a wise investment with ample potential. Hope this helps. 
This steamer works great on light fabrics such as silk. However when I tried steaming my cotton dress shirts, it took forever just to get a couple of wrinkles out. For its small size and price I'm fairly satisfied with this steamer, but don't expect it to replace your iron. 
I compared this travel model with the full-size J-2000 steamer. They were both very good at removing wrinkles from business-type clothing. We steamed a full week's wardrobe, and the clothing done with the travel steamer looked just as good as the others. The only drawback to the travel model is related to its small size - it needs to be refilled every 3-6 garments, and the smaller steam head means that it takes longer to steam an item. However, I actually found that the small steam head worked better on small areas like collars and cuffs, especially since it has squared corners. The corners mean that you do have to be a bit careful with delicate knits, though. Worth the price if you really need to look your best when you travel 
The hostess set is the perfect completion to this beautiful flatware set 
after owning a number of thermos' and other insulated bottles, this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break! parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner ($3.90 and $8.60, respectively), cheaper to get another carafe. after buying 5 total during the past year, i'm down to my last one. thats it, going to another manufacturer. I did prechill the carafe before filling with ice-water and ice. i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour. Followed carefully with ice. Upon putting the 1st cube in the bottle, the glass liner loudly shattered. I have never seen liners break so easily. I did notice on the last bottle i have left, before using it, the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe. i took it apart, and hand tightened everything. so far okay. this is the last carafe i'll buy that is zorirushi made 
I purchased the carafe to use with my French press. It works very well, keeping the coffee hot for several hours. Construction, fit, and finish are all up to standard. I find that it keeps my coffee hot longer if I first pre-heat the carafe with boiling water for a few minutes. Good value for the money 
This carafe is inexpensive and keeps the liquid hot for at least 12 hours. The only problem was that it had scratches and little stains on the lid and the surrounding area, even though it was delivered perfectly packaged. I am guessing Amazon sent me a returned item, not properly check. Two out of three items in that order came with scratches! I am a new customer and this is very disappointing, since up to now I did not have any problems with other sellers. I am not returning it because my previous carafe (Guzzini) after six months began to leak, so I need the carafe now. 
I was originally going to sink a lot of money into some sort of airpot, but I found this while looking for a rice cooker and couldn't resist the low price. WOW. I'm amazed at how long this keeps liquids HOT! Hours and hours! No leaks, the top is a snap (I agree with the reviewer who made the comment about fussy caraffe kids). This is a great item, I'm glad I bought it 
I put boiling hot water in this carafe at 6am and at 6pm, it still comes out steaming. I've had it for one year and it still amazes me. I've had no leakage or dribbling problems. The metal black body is sleek looking and has no fingerprints on it since I usually hold on to the handle or the top that are plastic. My only problem is having enough tea bags to keep up with it all day! I'm working on that. Five stars for price/performance 
I've been using my Zojirushi carafe for about a month now, and I believe it's awesome. Like the other reviews here note, it keeps your beverage hot for hours. For the money, it's a great deal. I'm using my Zojirushi 1-liter along with the Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone by RSVP (can be found here on Amazon). If you've never tried manual drip, I recommend you give it a shot 
My husband wanted something to take his coffee to work. After doing some research and seeing the ratings this item received on Amazon I gave it to him for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. One morning he filled it up with hot water so it could later be ready for the coffee and he forgot all about it. When I was getting ready to do dishes at about 6pm I poured out the water and it was still steaming hot. I highly recommend this to anyone. We have not had any leaking problems like some other reviewers. 
The ice cubes come out intact - not chipped or cracked. To get them out, push each cube from the bottom with your finger. For fastest and easiest results, wait for 5 minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer. This way, the ice cubes will pop right out. If you don't wait, your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out 
If you don't have an ice-maker, these are convenient. The ice pops out easily. My only frustrations were that I wanted more/larger pieces than I got per-tray that I wished it had a harder form to sit in so that it wouldn't splash or twist funny on the way to the freezer shelf 
This is, without exaggeration, the greatest knife ever made. I have some decent enough knives that I've used before (Sabatier), but this makes my other chef's knife look like an idiot. It is so effortless to use, and such a pleasure. Seriously, your food will practically cut itself with this knife. Your vegetables will part themselves, and the fat will slice itself away from your meats. I've always loved chopping food, ever since I learned how, but this raises the act from an enjoyable necessity past hobby and into the realm of culinary bliss 
This product is poorly designed. It appears to be very sturdy but soon broke. The case itself is very heavy but the cutiing wires are flimsy and quickly broke. Mow I am left with a very sturdy, inoperable tool. You should sell replacement wires 
This is a VERY heavy-duty egg slicer, which I like, but it is very hard to clean. There are very deep crevices and many nooks and crannies for egg to get caught in. Nevertheless, it is worth it to have an egg slicer with wires and other parts that won't get bent out of shape 
This "egg" slicer is great! Not only does it slice eggs, it also slice mushrooms perfectly. Much better than a food processor and more even slices than by hand (and quicker too). I used this slicer to slice the mushrooms for a pork dish for 150 people and it was quick and the slices were all uniform and neat. Heavy duty too. Well worth the price 
I have had the Capresso for just about 2 years (see my earlier rating.) It is worth it's weight in gold. The coffee is terrific....I have no desire to stop at Starbucks on the way home from work for my usual evening caffiene fix. The customer service has been terrific. Last week the steam knob was stuck and did not turn to open. Since the warranty period of 1 year was over, I was concerned about having to spend a huge amount to get it fixed. I tried cleaning the knob(thinking maybe some milk splatters and grunge had crusted underneath), I also tried WD 40.....to no avail. When I called customer service, I spoke with 'Gunther', who kindly walked me through prying off the knob and replacing it....and now it works perfectly! The machine is operated by my 10 and 12 year olds as well as my cleaning lady and sitter.....and it has never failed. A reproducible cup of coffee.... pretty much each time. On a rare occasion, the coffee is luke warm and has to be discarded. I have learnt the machines little nuances and can tweak the settings to make a perfect cup. I always use whole beans. I have found that when I use ground coffee I have to put in a tremendous amount per cup brewed. I also have only used non flavored coffee beans. The frother can get pretty crusted, so I usually take it apart and soak it in warm soapy water every other day. On occasion, if it is not reattached well it can pop off while steaming and make a bit of a mess, and possible scald you....so be careful. That has happened once or twice, and was probably why the steam knob got stuck with dried milk. At any rate, the Jura Capresso F7 gets 5 stars from me at the 2 year mark 
After staying with friends and enjoying a morning cup of coffee from their machine, I decided to purchase my own Jura-Capresso. After a month of now owning my machine, I can not express how much I enjoy the ability to make a perfect cup of coffee. The machine works very well and I have had no problems with it. I received the optional siphoning attachment to make latte's and hot hot milk drinks. This also works well for heating the milk prior to putting in the coffee. My only question is whether to purchase the after sale factory extended warranty as it is rather pricey 
I was very excited when my F7 arrived. Out of the box it looked good. After that, it was all downhill. The first problem was with the pressure. It dripped liquid into the cup - that was the rinse cycle. The coffee cycle was worse - nothing but slow drips with a rare drizzle. The second problem I had was with all those coffee grounds in the coffee. Of all the coffees I have had (and believe me that was a lot), I have never seen so many grounds in coffee. I ran the rinse cycle several more times trying to get the pressure to work. Nothing improved. I ran a whole container of water through it with the same results every time. I went on line to find answers - Capresso's web site was zero help (and they really do need to answer their Emails. Good luck to you if you need to contact them). The third problem I had was the noise. WOW! Is that a lumber mill inside the machine?! Are they putting out a fire in there after the coffee finishes its dripping? The bottom line is this - for $1300.00, there had better be rockets shooting that coffee out. It should be at least what they claim - same as a professional brew house espresso maker (or 18 bars). This machine is clearly not. The coffee grounds need to be reduced (a lot - my French press has fewer). Finally, the noise has to be less than my $15 grinder. I am not impressed at all. My $150.00 espresso maker put this one to shame. Too bad, the idea was a good but the F7 needs a lot of work. My F7 is on its way back. 
I've been using this machine for a couple of months now and so far so good. The espresso is rich and tasty. I've used Starbucks beans as well as "Coffee Bean Tea Leaf" beans and have had no problems with them at all. I have found that if I run the rinse cycle a little more frequently I get better espresso. The only downside I've seen is the size of the water tank - the machine will say it's out of water well before it's empty so the usable volume of the tank is much less than what they state as the size. 
I actually have the Capresso C1300, but was also experiencing problems with the frother. I took the tip posted by another reader and switched out the existing frothing tip with a Krups frothing tip. (I had an old Krups espresso/capuccino machine left over, before I upgraded to the Capresso). What do you know - it totally worked! The froth is sooooo much better with the new tip! 
I can't say a lot about this machine that hasn't already been said. The build quality is excellent and the coffee is the best I've ever had, consistently. I had avoided automatics for a while simply because pulling a shot seemed like such a romantic notion. Hah! Switching to a schedule that kicks off at 5:45 AM makes anything 'automatic' look a whole lot sexier. I am setting aside $$$ so that when this one finally fails (and that should be a while - this machine demonstrates superior engineering), I can dart right to the store and buy another. And, although I think microfoam might be another romantic notion (if it tastes good and wakes me up, I'm good), the previous reviewer might want to check his or her water quality - I have deliciously pure backwoods North Carolina well water that gives me superb crema 
This machine is outstanding, however this is just a silver-metalic version of the E8, which is less expensive. They both do anything and everything you would want to do if you're a coffee snob, so unless you're trying to match other shiney silver stuff in your kitchen, save a couple hundred $$$ and get an E8 
After 7 years or so of using a bulletproof Starbucks Barista which produced great espresso and copious microfoam, I bought this machine for my wife for Christmas (although she swears it was yet another gift to myself). The build quality and ease of use is great. The espresso is very good (but not up to the standards of a well pulled shot off a semi-auto). Nevertheless, the lack of any mess and pushbutton convenience outweighs any complaints about the quality of the shot - don't get me wrong, it pulls a very nice shot. What it doesnt do well is create the beautiful microfoam an experienced user can get using a traditional steam wand. All of these super-autos have that annoying steam-assist wand which is supposed to require no skill to create foam. Unfortunately all it does it create these large crappy bubbles and very little foam. To make matters worse, the side steam holes get clogged very easily and then the result is NO FOAM. I called wholelattelove and Capresso looking for a solution and they each had no clue either (a) how to solve the problem, or (b) why in the world I didnt like the crappy large soap bubble excuse for microfoam. Well for $8 I found a Krups metal steam tip off the net (go to culinaryparts.com for a $1.99 steam tip plus $6 shipping) and screwed it on to the end of the metal wand after having discarded the useless steaming aid sleeve and old plastic tip, and VOILA! -- awesome foam made in half the time I could do the same thing with my old Starbucks Barista. These machines all have a Thermoblock for steaming unlike the traditional boiler on a better semi-auto. Nevertheless it is enough and the foam is first rate as I said. The only other thing to be aware of is that these machines cant use my beloved Peats coffee beans - too oily and they get stuck in the hopper- so I am still searching for a good dark roast which is not too oily. But for now after a month of use, I am happy with the espresso and the foam and delighted to make my morning cap with a minimum of effort. The F7 in particular is a great machine as against the other Juras. It is more programmible than the E* and much simpler to use (and smaller footprint) than the pricier units. I almost bought the F9 but there is just too much to think about on that machine and the bright chrome is a bit too shiny and pretentious. The F7 is the perfect mix of functionality and understated good looks. It is also the newest technology from Jura so it has some small touches that the F9 doesnt have, such as a 120 second steam timer versus the 60 second timer on the F9. Update to the above review: After many more months of use I am loving the Jura F7, and I found the beans to use: Blue Bottle Coffee Hayes Valley Espresso. Not too oily but very flavorful. Perfect for this machine. Better than Peats, and definitely fresher. I am not going to list their website here cause I dont want to look like a shill for them. But you can find them, I am confident. They will mail out to you for no additional cost. By the way, the review above that says the F7 is a shinier version of the E8 is incorrect. The basic mechanism may be the same, but the programming functions and other nice features are significantly different. If you're already spending this much coin, the F7 is a better deal than the E8. Just my humble opinion 
I got the Impressa F7 for mother's day and it has changed my life around! The coffee is predictably par excellence and both my husband and I have no desire to go out for coffee anymore. In fact when we are out, we would rather come home than go to Starbucks. The machine seemed formidable at first (I find any thing with manuals to be intimidating), but after reading the manual and trying out the F7 a few times I got it right. I have since perfected the art of frothing and steaming. It comes with a video, though I did not watch it. CONS: has a fairly large foot print....needs a lot of counter space. Flavored coffee beans cannot be used in the grinder....something to do with the oils. Because of this I have switched from hazelnut coffee to unflavored coffee, and frankly, the coffee is so good that I don't miss the flavored kind. The accessories such as the water filter and the cleaning tablets are not easily available.....I have to order them directly from Capresso, or from Williams and Sonoma. Finally, although this is a somewhat expensive machine ($1400), we have recovered half the cost of the machine over the past 3 months by not going to specialty coffee stores and spending $3 for each cup. Hope you find this review helpful. K 
I am not a coffee shop expert so my expectations may be different than yours. My needs were the following when considering buying this machine: 1. Consistant coffee shop taste and quality. 2. Easy to use 3. Easy clean up 4. An intelligent machine 5. Well built This machine is really cool. It makes the whole coffee making process so simple. The results are fabulous. Everything comes out nice and hot. The machine is very intelligent with a lot of cool little features in place to make your life easier. The frother works great. Setup was a breeze. I got it on amazon.com for $853.00 brand new from a marketplace seller. A great deal it was! 
I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it. Well that chance did not pay off. Even in combination with the plug-in model my cat continued to spray everywhere. If anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it 
I donate Feliway to our local Humane Society and have educated them on how to use it to reduce stress by applying it in the cages. I also volunteer and take photos of the cats. I have found by applying a small amount to each arm, it is easier to get timid cats out of the cages. I have also used this product in our home to help with introducing new cats to existing ones and to eliminate spraying problems by a FEMALE. I highly recommend it 
We purchased this and the diffuser on recommendation from our vet. We have 4 cats and one insists on pooing once a day outside the box, otherwise she always uses the box...well it has not helped 
Fastest shipping ever! Thank you so much, we will buy from you again 
One of our two cats has chronic litter box problems. I have done tons of research and taken him to the vet numerous times, tried special litter and special food, even considered medication. Then the vet suggested Feliway. I was amazed! My cat completely stopped urinating on my living room carpet AND actually began choosing a sandbox over the carpet within two to three weeks of consistent use of Feliway spray. I don't have any idea why this product works, I just know it DOES work. You have to be VERY consistent with it and reapply to the problem spots every day, but it does work. It even works if I catch my cat looking for a place to go on the carpet - once I spray the Feliway, he will literally walk away from the carpet and use the box instead. From other reviews it seems Feliway doesn't work for all cats, but for us it has been a life saver. Our cat has always had a nervous personality so maybe it works better for anxious kitties. Also it seems the spray and the diffuser don't work the same. We tried the diffuser too but our cat seems to need it sprayed directly on the problem spot. I really recommend this product. Try both formulas and just be patient and you may get the results I have! 
Hi Everyone, Last Friday Tazz (our male cat) was attacked in our yard by a loose dog, needless to say I rushed him to the hospital Friday afternoon and upon the initial examination, the vet did not find any external damage. The next day I gave Tazz a bath because he was covered in urine from the attack and that is when I noticed a lump on his right rear hip. I took him to another emergency hospital at which they did an ultra sound of his hip and found he has a hematoma / fluid in his hip. The vet gave me some anti-inflammatory liquid to give him but he is still in pain and you can see it when he tries to jump or climb. In addition, his whole demeanor has changed to being scared of the slightest noise or movement. He hides frequently and does not talk / meow anymore. My Veterinarian recommended Feliaway Spray, which the Veterinarian said, would help with his anxiety in addition to helping him heal from the emotional trauma of the attack. I received the Feliaway today in the mail and after spraying it on a couple of places where Tazz frequents, I must say his attitude is very much improved. I would HIGHLY recommend this product even though it is a bit pricey it just takes a WEE BIT for it to have an effect. Call it aromatherapy for cats, whatever the case if can help a cat after a dog attack then I say it's a product that deserves high marks. 
i got 2 bottles it does not work and was a waste of money. cat attract cat litter works better 
This stuff stopped my cat from peeing all over the furniture, which started after bringing a new cat into my home. Also spraying it on furniture the cats claw up stops them from doing it. No cat owner should be without this 
I used this product in combination with "Sticky Paws " (found on Amazon), and both vertical AND horizontal scratching posts. We bought two new upholstered chairs 3 weeks ago and my 3 boys haven't touched them!!--This is a great product and I will buy it again--Two paws up! 
I love this product! We use it mainly for grinding chicken breasts. I find it very easy to use and extremely easy to clean up 
This grinder does just what it says, it is fast and easy to use, simple to assemble and disassemble, and easy to clean and maintain.... i just received this yesterday and today i ground approx. 30 lbs. of meat with it. i did it about 5 lbs. at a time. i did let it rest between each "load". It didn't overheat or even get hot. I would recommend this grinder to anyone for home use 
I think the machine was great at first. It's fast and eficient, but if you have more than 5 lb.of meat to grind and you don't want smoke coming out from the motor, You might want to give it a break in between. Plus, the cutting plates and the feed screw turn rusting and black even you put cooking oil after wash as directed by the instruction book, and they have this iron/metal smell on the cutting plate that contaminate the meat. I am very disappointed. 
I tried it and the meat got stuck. I had to disassemble and clean multiple times to finish grounding two pounds' of meat. Ended up returning it 
I love steamed fish, this steamer is a wide, flat, stable place to put my plate for steaming. I tried to use my vegetable steamer with the post removed but it just wasn't stable enough. This is perfect. We also steamed a few tamales left in the freezer from Christmas, I'm sure you could steam other things like buns or vegetables but I haven't tried those yet. Also, a big plus is that it stores in the wok so it doesn't take up space in the kitchen. Delivery was very fast as well 
I got this because I saw Rachel use it on her food network show. I watched her show occasionally and I like her and some of her ideas although I am not a devoted follower. I use this pan to make meat sauce for spaghetti, to brown chicken, for my mom's shrimp Creole, to stir fry, to sauté vegetables, fry chicken wings, pan fry cornbread and to make two grilled cheese sandwiches when both my boys are hungry and can't wait. This pan does it all. The center stays hotter so you can cook food in the center and move it to the ends to keep it warm. The shape also makes it easier to handle. I cook on a gas cook top with 5 burners and the oval shape is easier to maneuver when using all the burners and having handles of both sides makes moving the pan easy even when it is full. It also cleans up easily as you would expect of a non-stick pan; there are two rivets inside the pan where the handle attaches. The rivets are not non-stick if you know that food will touch the rivets I suggest spraying the rivets with oil before cooking this will make clean up easier. This is a great heavy duty pot and the glass top is nice so you can see how the food is cooking without taking the top off and altering the cooking temperature. I also like the look of these Rachel Ray pots, her other line has handles the color of safety orange that remind you of construction cones I am not sure why anyone would think that looks attractive in a kitchen. I also purchased the 8-quart Oval Pasta pot and the lids are inter-changeable, which is great if you are cooking something that requires a taller lid. The price on this pot went up and down; as high as $99.00 and as low as $65.00. A friend who is a longtime Amazon shopper suggested putting it in my cart and waiting until it hit a good price to purchase it I did, I got it at a good price and I am happy. Quality pan, easy to clean and looks nice (no safety cone orange) this is a great choice 
I had looked at the oval saute pan for quite awhile. I'm a Rachel Ray fan, so I'd seen her use it too. Frequently I found my pans bumping each other on my stove top and I have a large stove top. I decided to try the oval pan and it didn't disappoint. It cooks evenly and is easy to clean-up. It holds a ton of food another plus for me since I often double recipes. I would highly recommend this product and plan to purchase addition Anolon pans 
I did some research on pans because I wanted some for Christmas to replace the old ones. I have a 10 inch skillet, 4.5 quart sauce and 5 quart oval pans and they are best pans I've ever owned. What I love about them? 1. Mine do not have any sticking issues what so ever. 2. They clean extremely easy and fast via hand washing (no hard scrubbing at all). 3. Since it only takes seconds to clean, I can reuse to cook something else without any flavor from the previous meal. 4. The handles do not get hot and they have a good non-slip grip (I have the silicone rubber handles). 5. They apparently can be put in the oven up to 350 degrees but I have not tried that yet. 6. They are not as heavy as some professional ones. I would recommend buying this brand. Con If I had to say anything bad about them, the only thing I can think of is the rivets that are inside the pan that attach the handle to the pan can get food stuck around them so you really have to clean around that area good. I wish they would have just attached the handle to the outside of the pan 
I'm also surprised at some of the reviews. I LOVE this pan. I have a full set of KitchenAid hard-anodized pans that I bought about 3 years ago and just adore, and I thought I'd add another chef's skillet since I cook a lot. The oval shape of this pan interested me. This pan is terrific and has been getting almost daily use since I bought it about 3 weeks ago. It works well on my ceramic cooktop, cleans nicely and is quite versatile. I should mention that Analon makes a product made specially for hard-anodized cookware, which I bought a few months ago and that does a terrific job of removing the little scratches on the cookware as well as cleaning any discolorations, so I'd recommend looking for that if you find that your pans are looking scratched 
I agree that this pan would do much better on a gas stove. I wish I had a gas stove. But, I still love this pan. It's big enough to hold a lot of food and the handle IS oven-safe to 375 degrees. I used it in the oven to bake "chicken with 40 cloves of garlic" at 350 degrees for an hour and a half and had no problems whatsoever (and I did NOT cover the handle). It is a tad on the heavy side, but it's still easy to lift with the helper handle (and I have wicked tendonitis in my elbows). I would recommend this pan to anyone and I hope to get the matching pasta pot soon 
I cook every single day - I'm told I'm an excellent cook - trying different dishes - complex and simple. I like RR's recipes - but can't stand to watch her anymore....but this pan as well as the large pasta pot (also oval) looked like good ideas and I got them. I LOVE THEM. I want a second saute pan. I haven't had a single issue with the pan. I love how you can move things that are cooking too quickly to a far corner - and move other things to the center where the most heat is. I saute, fry and cook many, many things in this pan and have no problems. The pasta pot is PERFECT for boiling spaghetti and other pasta products - no sticking whatsoever - and I can get 4 pots on the stove top with these two pans. 
Buyer beware!! Don't bother buying this. Terrible quality. If you bought one at a local dollar store you would be better off and a lot easier on your wallet. 
Item was satisfactory but thought it was bigger. Probably my mistak 
Great size for a small to moderate serving; Fiestaware has been a good find and value for our family (2 generations) as all the place setting colors we have are still available (24 places/6 colors). We have been able to replace anything that has been broken, plus add different pieces (just added these bowls to the original 2 colors to which we atarted our home). Mixing colors makes for a variety of beautiful table settings for seasons and hoidays 
These are called "Fruit Bowl" but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream 
Perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who don't like their food all running together on your plate. Good for snacks like pudding and jello. Also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side ~ nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing. Plus it won't take up alot of space on your table. This is a very nice color 
I have several of these bowls and use them frequently. They are the perfect size for snacks. I also use them frequently for food prep tasks when I'm cooking - they're a good size to hold a half-cup to one cup of a dry ingredient. And of course, they are the perfect size for their intended purpose - fruit. I find myself putting fruit on the table more often now that I have these bowls. A cereal sized bowl seems like a lot of dish for one serving of fruit. This smaller size prevents clutter on the table - especially if you are serving salad and bread on individual dishes. 
I did what you're doing now, and read these reviews. From my perspective, this is the single greatest travel mug on the market. One reviewer mentioned that it doesn't stay warm long enough, however my coffee/tea stays respectably warm for AT LEAST AN HOUR. Usually more. There is something truly satisfying about tossing a full travel mug of coffee onto the floor of your car if you're in a hurry... or placing it in your backpack between classes --- and neeever worrying about it spilling. pure genius! my ONLY complaint is that the handle isn't conducive to the cupholder in my Mazda 6. The handle extends too far down which causes it to get in the way of my center console... I can only stabilize it in the cupholder if both cupholes are empty. BUT since it's leak proof, I have no problem setting it on the seat next to me 
Nice looking mug and No spills but, you better drink your coffee very fast. Terrible insulation system. Don't buy it 
I have had only good experiences with this travel mug as well as with other Trudeau insulated products. The 360 degree drinking (meaning you can drink from any side) is a good feature. The mug needs to be opened with two hands so not good for people who want to open and close it while driving. The black finish is very sleek but isn't a tough finish if the mug is going to be banged around. I have seen ones in stores with scratches on them 
Beautiful mug and the coffee stays hot. When they say leakproof lid, however, they really mean it. Even in the open position NOTHING comes out!!! Can't figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid. We have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of "travel mugs". I took advantage of the 5 year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem. Apperently as the gasket on the lid heats up it expands. Then the seal is just as tight as if it were in the closed position. We are very unhappy with this product and I wish to give it -5 Stars 
This coffee mug did not keep the coffee hot. I would not make the same purchase again 
I have had the more well-known travel mugs, and thought that they were the best. Well, I was wrong. This travel mug is by far the best out there. It is truly leak-proof. My friends get tired of me turning it upside down (I guess I'm easily amused hehe), but I really do like a mug that won't spill if tipped over. When turned to the drink side, the liquid flows at about the right rate, not too fast, not too slow. Anyway, I can't say enough about this mug, and the price also beats the competition 
I love the curved handle, it feels great! This company knows what they are doing!!! .........I put up two towel bars (one above the other) and hung on hooks all of their tools and gagets. 
When I purchased this item there were 4 dishes shown on the picture. I ordered a quanity of 2, however when I received the items I received only 2 dishes not the total of 8 that I expected 
I had the same problem as the first poster. By all appearances, this item is advertised as 6 souffle dishes. Heck, the item number ends in dash 6 !! 
One would assume you would be getting six dishes as the picture shows six and the 4, 10 and 14 ounce versions come in packs of six. However I only received one and had to call Amazon to correct this 
Don't expect this to be the same quality as Corningware, it isn't. Lots of useful pieces, not positive about quality re: how they will hold up, but the range of sizes offers lots of options. 
All the pieces are great - the sizes, durability, functionality... etc. I ordered to add to some previously purchased pieces - my only "complaint" is that the pieces are really beige - not WHITE. But in reality - so what the big deal if they don't match - right!?!?! It's well worth the price I paid 
I gave this as a Christmas gift to my mom. She has always used glass and metal bakeware. For the price, it was a steal 
This is an excellent set and a fantastic bargain. It is perfect for someone who is just outfitting a kitchen. I am going to use it as a shower gift. I notice it is currently unavailable, but if and when it is available, don't hesitate to snap one up, I might even get a set for myself 
The only reason I didnt give this set another star is because I havent actually tried them yet but they are fantastic looking, seem very durable and well worth the $26.99 I paid for them. You can tell just by looking at them that they are well worth this price and MORE! I bought these for myself as an early Christmas gift and am really looking forward to trying these out 
This cookware is so wonderful that I can't find the words to describe it! Not only is is absolutely gorgeous in classic white but it does everything the manufactor says... (kinda rare these days)! Im so happy I took the chance and purchased two sets at $25 each.. its already made Thanksgiving cooking so much easier and elegant! Thank you Amazon for a winner 
I snapped up this set when it got marked down under $30 mainly because I needed ramekins and some casserole dishes with lids. I haven't actually cooked/baked in them yet but they look great and I'm looking forward to trying them out. The only thing that perplexed me was when the box arrived, it said on the side: ship to QVC - Germany, which I thought was kind of odd. Inside...I located instructions but unfortunately...they were in german and since I only had 1/4 semester of the german language in junior high school...I have no idea what the instructions say to do. But I can live with that feeling I got an awesome deal on a nice looking set. 
Look, I consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to Ceramic Bakeware Sets. I've tried them all. The set from Luber Corporation falls short. And don't even get me started on Cerama Inc. What a disaster!! If you're serious about laying down a little bit of your hard earned cashed for ceramic bakeware, make sure you grab this nifty 11 piece set from the good folks at Meyer. They won't let you down. This will handle all your baking needs--from the every day to the extra special circumstances. None of the competitors can match up. And in case you didn't notice, IT COMES IN WHITE!! No more crummy colors like electric green or fuschia. Just good old classic white like grandma used to use 
Works like a charm. Great for pizza and homemade bread and biscuits 
Bought this set after many years of homemade pizzas in deep dish pans. Too high in carbs so we thought about a pizza stone for thinner crust pizzas. This set works GREAT. Heat the stone for 20 minutes while the dough is rising on the peel and you're layering your ingredients. Then slide it onto the stone for 20-25 minutes. GREAT PIZZA, just like a wood-fired pizza cafe!! 
Arrived very fast and am looking forward to using it for a long time 
What can I say?...It fits perfectly over the pan and covers ALL the contents 
I received my chair and it was missing a side panel. The chair was hard to put together. The chair is of quality and very comfortable 
This is a great chair, and especially at this price. I bought one a year ago and paid more, and thought I got a good deal, then I purchased another 2 months ago, on sale and, was I ever happy. This is a very comfortable chair, easy to put together and the fabric is great. Liquids just bead up. This is a fine chair! 
Our beagle and our lab are both heavy shedders.. We saw the video for the FURminator in our local petstore and thought we'd see if it might help - normally we use a regular brush and a slicker brush and there's still hair floating around ALL the time. On the advice of the cashier, we used it outside for the first time. GOOD IDEA! I haven't seen that much fluff come off of any animal before - other than shearing sheep! Both dogs loved it - no pain, no fuss - and their coats look wonderful. Best of all, there's hardly any hair in the house these days. (Our lawn, however, looks like a dog exploded..) I recommend this to anyone whose dog fits the list of appropriate "shedding" breeds. It's completely amazing 
I have two cats. One is a shedder the other a short haired tabby. This has worked great on both of the cats. I already notice after using it a few weeks I can actually pet the female cat now without getting hair all over the place. The hardest thing with it is the static created with the brushing then the hair wants to stick to my hands while I pull it off. Not a problem compared to the benefits. 
Hair all ovah? sick of sweepin??? fuggeddaboudit. And Don't listen to that wuss who complained about the hair flyin in her face. What a wuss. All ya haffta do wid dis ding is gently pull it over your kitty's back and baddaging baddabang. NO MORE LOOSE HAYAH. In all seriousness folks. I was amazed at how well this worked, and it will CERTAINLY cut down on the daily clean up of shed hair from any shedding pet. My cat LOVES it too. So there ya go, take it from a SOPRANO 
I couldn't belive how much hair came out of my dog (Lab), especially compared to a conventional comb. Her coat actually felt thinner. I cannot say my house has NO dog hair, but it has decreased dramatically. Less vacuuming, less frustration, and more time to spend with Zeppy! I highly recommend the Furminator 
This dog rake is the best I have ever used. My dog is a Chow Chow, so lots of thick winter undercoat needed to come out. I get lots more hair in much less time. I had broken my arm, so I didn't have the strength to comb my dog this spring. The groomer suggested I get the Furminator. WOW! It was so much easier. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone with a dog that has a thick undercoat 
I was stunned by how much hair this thing took off! I have 2 Welsh Corgi's and most brushes just run over their surface hair but the Furminator brought out all the fine underneath hair... I just love it and have told all my dog loving friends about it. My Aunt bought one and then ordered another for my cousin 
i had this for 2 years and used it about once a month. i was very happy with it at first, since it was very easy to use. however i found that it had no way of stopping when the cork had been screwed up high enough, and it just kept going, so that the cork would become wedged in the opener, then it would break off and i would have to use a knife to try and prise the cork out of the device. this happened a few times, and the last time i just couldn't get the cork out, which meant i couldn't use the corkscrew, because it already had a cork around the top part of it. after a while i had to throw it out 
When I thought of OXO I though of great grips. Nice soft quality weighty feel. When I got this corkscrew I was shocked to find out that it was flimsy black plastic. Looks like OXO in the picture but it is nothing more then cheap plastic bits. OXO degraded their name with this product 
I recommend this item for anyone who enjoys wine, but doesn't have the manual ability to deal with the hard to use all-metal corkscrew gadgets. I appreciate the easy grip on the top and the way the screw part doesn't jam with the cork. I initially was introduced to the OXO Good Grips line through a family member with Multiple Sclerosis. The Good Grips products seemed to be the only thing she could easily use and that would not break easily when dropped. I quickly learned, however, that the line of products is not limited to use by folks with dexterity issues and have since fallen in kitchen love with my various OXO food gadgets 
The OXO corkscrew consists of a black plastic corkscrew that screws down into the cork, surrounded by a black plastic skirt-like surround with wing-like handles and a wide twist-top. But maybe this will make more sense if I try to explain how you use it. You raise the handles, which lifts up the surround, exposing the corkscrew. You grasp the handle at the top, press the tip of the corkscrew against the cork, and twist, pushing, so that the corkscrew enters into the cork and spirals down through it. Once it's firmly embedded you grasp the wing-like handles and push them down. This lowers the surround and raises the corkscrew, pulling the cork free of the bottle. Disadvantages: It's easy to get the corkscrew off-center and end up having to start over. Advantages: The wing-handles give you so much leverage that it's child's play to get most corks out of their bottles. This is absolutely fantastic for those of us with hand-problems. This is one of the few OXO items we have that hasn't in some way broken down; admittedly we don't use it as often as some items, but it has certainly withstood what use we have put it through. It's a nifty-looking design that makes opening bottles very easy on my hands despite my tendonitis. I only occasionally have troubles with the corkscrew going in off-center (I think because the surround can partially block your view of the corkscrew as you put it in, and the distance between handle and corkscrew tip decreases accuracy), and it isn't that large of a problem. 
I drink more wine than I sometimes like to admit, and so I open a lot of bottles. I've used waiter's corkscrews, the fancy two prong kind, the lever 'Rabbit' ones, and the standard winged kind, like this OXO version. I have to say, of every wine opener I have ever used, this is the worst by far. I love every other item I've tried that carries the OXO name, but this one is a miserable failure. My main complaint is that when you line the screw up with the cork, and the wings are down, there's nowhere to grab for stability when turning the knob on the top. You have to kind of poke your fingers between where the wings meet and squeeze. Once you do get it going, half the time it only goes part of the way in and you end up with a half-removed, or worse - broken - cork. Terrible terrible terrible. But the $2 winged corkscrew at the grocery store instead. Even better, get a good quality waiters corkscrew and never worry about how you're going to open a bottle of wine again 
this corkscrew is flawed in several ways: in spite of its "ergonomic" design, it is awkward to use. the screw is too short and often mauls the cork beyond recognition and reuse. simply screwing it into the cork and pulling the wings down does not pull the cork far enough out of the bottle--you have to wiggle, wiggle, wiggle it. save your money 
If you are familiar with the Le Creuset brand you will already know the quality. This is fantastic quality cookware. The beauty of buying it from Amazon is the price. I purchased this set when it was on sale for $179.99. At that time they also had a promotion for 2-free Ramakins and a free 7-piece set of Spatula's and Canister (items totalling around $95!!). So that just made the deal extra special. All i can say is if they have a similar promotion running in future you should jump on it as you wont find such quality items at the same great price anywhere else!! 
This set is really nice. It warms up super fast and retains heat longer due to the cast iron. It looks wonderful hanging in my kitchen too!! The pots have been used heavily and still no chips. Cleans up super easy with soap and water (I have never tried the dishwasher). It is a heavy set, but the bestest of quality 
I received this water filter two days after I placed the order. I'm happy with the fast service. As for the water filter, you might want to consider rinsing it after taking it out from the package before inserting it into the coffee maker. Also, I ran water through the coffee maker twice before making the first pot of coffee for the peace of mind. If you have paper filter placed before running the water, you will be able to see little green particals in it at the end of the process 
The water filter for the Braun Flavorselect 12 cup coffee maker Model KF187 is a great design. I rate it #5 for it's design, but since my original purchase of the coffee maker, I can't find the filter units anywhere 
Our water is just horrible. Prior to purchasing this coffee maker and several of the little filters, I would just replace coffee makers every couple of months. No amount of cleaning would help. I loved this coffee maker, and have been really upset because I can't find the filters. Glad to find them here!! 
I have had the Braun Coffee maker for 6 years and enjoy the great tasting coffee that the Braun filter produces with this coffee maker. It is easy and convenient to use, and I would not make any coffee without it. However, the filters are a bit difficult to find in my area... 
You're supposed to replace these filters every two months - I couldn't find them in a store anywhere and tried ordering them online directly from the manufacturer, but I guess my order was lost somewhere in cyberspace. Amazon to the rescue! I have finally replaced my coffee maker water filter after 2 years, and that's a good thing 
The water filter is inexpensive and pretty good.. Serves the purpose and light on your pocket.. 
OXO may have a good name but this is one terrible product. Sure, it is very easy to turn, but what good is that when hardly any product comes out? No matter how you try to adjust it on the bottom we have to turn and turn, getting hardly no pepper at all. Our money was thrown away in buying this pepper mill. 
This model is a nice little pepper mill: relatively easy to fill, easy to use, and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, performance leaves a lot to be desired. Turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse; I would described it as cracked rather than ground. Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out. Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work; unfortunately I can't figure out what that adjustment would be. Based on other reviews, I'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue. If it worked I would be happy. As it is, I'm purchasing yet another pepper mill. 
I really like this new version of the OXO Good Grips Pepper Mill. It works great...better than the old one 
This product did a terrible job of grinding and produced very inconsistant pepper grinds. In addition, it was very hard to keep peppricorns fed into the grinder without going forwards and backwards with the crank. 
I bought this pepper grinder because I love Oxo products, and I also have carpel tunnel and arthritis in my hands. I don't really care for pepper, but when I buy it I buy a combination of coarse pepper and sea salt. I love the little window that you open to fill it, as well as being able to see how much is in there. I also like the cap on the bottom, so it keeps it clean sitting on my stovetop, but most of all I like the knob to grind the spice. I have mine set on fine grind, but it is adjustable. I think you could use it for any spice you want to grind, not just pepper. It is fun and easy to use and looks nice sitting on my stove. I love this gadget! 
Have not had it for very long. I have arthritis and it is easy for me to use 
We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo 
This is not the only peppermill I own, but it is the only one I'll use. I hate to admit it , but I have walked into the dining room to retrieve this baby even though a perfectly usable mill was right in the kitchen cupboad in front of me. I did not intend to become such a peppermill snob but this is such a well designed tool that I can no longer settle for using the old ones. All previous mill suffered from similar problems which Oxo has solved. In Maryland, humidity is always a problem for peppermills. Not for this one. Through the dog days of August, when other mills are just mashing peppers into a gummy paste and clogging to the point where you will gladly settle to a year old can of ground pepper, this mill produces a talc fine powder. I've read that other people have trouble getting a fine grind. You cannot just crank down on the adjustment nut to get a fine grind. Your have to turn the crank counter clockwise as you tighten the adjuster. This helps clear the mechanism. If you don't do this, the larger peppercorns block the mechanism from closing down all the way. Once you get the hang of how to adjust this mill, it will provide copiuous quantities of pepper from extra cource to super fine. The easy grip handle eliminates all the wasted motion associated with tradional mill. I make my own barbeque rub and always hated grinding enough pepper for the recipe. Most mills only grind correctly in one direction. So, you twist the knob, release it reposition your grip and twist again. Half your motion is wasted. Now, thanks to the easy grip handle I can crank out tablespoons of pepper in seconds. When I'm done, I set the mill back on it clip-on base so there is no pepper dust in my spice cabinet. If you believe that form follows function, this is a beautiful tool. If you need more status from you peppermill get a solid walnut mill or a brushed aluminum mill from another manufacturer. Just don't expect it to out perform this classic. 
I have purchased several other pepper grinders out there and this one is by far the best.It is inexpensive and can grind pepper at ease.This is a life saver when you are cooking and seasoning with large amounts of pepper, no more sore forearms from twisting or squeezing those unproductive pepper grinders out there. This thing rocks! 
Just as with the vac filter, these do the job they were designed to do and do it not badly. More notable is the fact that I've never heard Mrs. Wife cussing when using them, so they must work out OK 
The pads work great, large and easy to put on, wish the vacuum was bit more powerful, but overall a good quick cleanup product 
This item is really overprice for a piece of wood with slots. Cheaply made in China. You can buy the 19 slot version for $39.95 on Amazon 
This is another gorgeous piece by fiesta. It is lovely and functional. My only issue is that the dimensions state it is 12" tall, when it is really less than 8"!!! So, beautiful, but small. 
I purchased the turquoise and sunflower a while back and just recently ordered the cobalt and cinnabar. I loved this carafe especially when serving weekend brunches--even with just my family of four. We feel fancy using the different fiestawares--and that is really special to my 5-year old. I use this for water, orange juice, or whatever kind of juice you want. And it just makes the table a little more festive. The only thing I was surprised when I got this was I thought it would be a little bigger. Other than that, it is absolutely beautiful and I don't mind having it in more colors than I already have 
The photo does not do this piece justice! My jaw dropped when I first pulled it out of the box. The color is beautiful, as is the styling, it feels good in hand, and is as sturdy as Fiestaware's reputation. I haven't however, used it yet, but from years of experience with this company's pieces I'm betting on it's efficiency 
I love the carafe and would like to know if you will receive this one in shamrock green because I am wanting to purchase 4 different colors. Please respond 
I ordered two of these great Fiesta handled carafes in black. I plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces. Black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so I had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase. I have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces. I was not happy when I received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips (where the white under the glaze shows through) as well as scratches in the glaze (which I have never seen before and can't imagine what happened to put them there). In my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds. I love the pieces, I'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish. I also received a black covered butter which was blemish free 
I have the 10-piece Circulon Elite set, and purchased this pot to go with that set. It's bigger than the saucepans that come in the set, so it's a nice addition. It's a bit taller and narrower than other saucepans of similar size, which I find helps to balance the pan when it's full and I'm lifting it between the stove and other locations. It heats evenly and it seems to be of good quality 
Great addition to my set of these pots pans. It's nice to have the glass tops to peek inside. The rubberize handles make them nice to use. Everything cooks even and is easy to clean up. 
it is very functional, from table top - frig. - microwave and even to oven 
Looks good, works in convection or microwave, comes with lid, decent price 
I purchased two of these bowls years ago and they have held up well. I use them more than any of my tupperware because they can go straight from the fridge to the microwave and in to the dishwasher. I was very pleased to find that Amazon had them so I ordered another. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because the new lid seems to be a cheaper quality than the older ones I already own. Would definately recommend this bowl to anyone looking for a good leftover/storage bowl 
A great storage container. Since it's glass you can store without worry of discoloration 
I cook and freeze a lot of meals for my husband, who often works late. I won't use Tupperware or other plastic because I believe plastic can leach into food while microwaving, but Pyrex bowls of this size are hard to find in stores -- most stores have Pyrex baking sets with several containers that are too large or too small. Finally, I can buy just these bowls, as many as I want, without getting stuck with other sizes I don't need. This is a great price for them, too -- on ebay, people want more, plus shipping 
Was looking for clear bowls so I can see the contents while heating in the microwave and prevent foods from boiling over. These fit the bill perfectly and I use them to make my oatmeal in the morning or to heat up small quantities of sauces. The bowls are also nice enough to serve from or eat from, and they can also be put in the regular oven or freezer to store foods. Simply great and the price is right! 
This one is very nice. Serve and store...hold good 3 cups! Really good for the price $2.99... lesser than the outlet price! Good buying! 
It's conveniently sized for a number of daily kitchen activities from mixing in a bowl to scraping out the last remnants of cream cheese. And it's not flimsy at all even though the whole, seemless piece is silicon; in fact it's sturdy and comfortable in the hands. I don't use it for heated applications so I can't tell you how it performs at high temperatures.. 
This is rather a silly spatula. The reason it's silly is because it is a rather small spatula, with an odd pointy tip, a very tiny paddle, and thus a very short paddle edge for actual scraping. This makes it pretty much useless for various spatula-enabled tasks such as, say, scraping batter out of a mixing bowl. I may be missing some incredibly obvious use for this weird little spatula -- I suppose the pointy tip might be useful for scraping out the bottoms of mayonnaise jars, but I do wonder how many people in this world go through so much mayonnaise that they would need an item like this on a regular basis. The reason I got this spatula in the first place was because it was inexpensive and has single-piece silicone construction (no places for gunk to collect), but there are much better single-piece silicone spatulas out there -- for instance, ones that are shaped like normal spatulas, with a paddle big enough to get some actual spatula work done. What better way to say "I love you," than with the gift of another spatula? Don't get this one. 
Wonderful little thing! Works great! Easy to clean! Remember the regular one? I have to pull out the spatula head and clean the hole where the stick goes into. It gets yucky after a period of time. The one is excellent. There is no separable part, no hard-to clean corners! The whole thing is solid firm and easy to manipulate! Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!! Love it! Love it! Love it!!! Every kitchen should be equiped one!! 
The texture and "feel" of these sheets does not feel like a 600 thread count fabric. Even after several washings, they feel coarse and rough. I am very disappointed with this set 
Sheets are comfortable and they look very pricey.But I doubt it will last more than 5 washes to meet the (my)durability standards for a 600 thread count. 
For 600 tc, I expected alot more. Sheets started to pill after only a few days. Were not the soft quality that I thought they would be either. Felt like the standard 180 tc ones. I returned them 
these sheets are soooo soft and the price I payed you could not find Anywhere,just get them, you won't be sorr 
Don't listen to the reviews about it not fitting and the sheets smelling funny. I have a queen extra full pillow top and tehy fit fine! The only things I did find is that you should dry them with low heat insted of high heat, and they werent quite as soft as I though but over all I love them. The sheets do not have a weird smell to them, they smell like anything NEW. I would suggest getting them they are great 
I purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress. The mattress probably measures 16" in depth. The first time the sheets were put on the bed, they slightly pulled from the centers, i.e. the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well. After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set 
I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly "Everlasting". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy 
I have a 4 year old, 20 lbs Boston Terrier male. Little man was entertained for almost 2 hours with the treat ball. Loved it 
Our little rat terrier can usually make a ten minute snack out of the biggest rawhide treats. This thing has kept him very busy for three to four days on a refil, and the main ingredients are not nearly as likely to clog his pipes. The inserts force him to clean his teeth, and he cannot put it down. Does not seem to even be interested in chewing the container. Looks hocus, but I tell you, this thing is GRREat 
Great Pan. I had a hard time finding some of these sizes. : 
I really lilke the springform pan. The offset surface allowed me to remove my cheesecake from the pan with easem, and the dark surface aborbed more heat in the oven and there was better color on the cheesecake than that of other pans I have used. The size was just perfect for a small cheesecake, so if you don't bake much and don't want to have a lot of leftovers, buy this pan. Just remember to scale down the recipe accordingly. A note of caution, I am not the athority on whether or not it is actually leak proof. It has been my experiencee that all springform pans leak, so I always wrap them in tin foil. The pan did show the least traces of leakage of the springform pans I have, though 
After having my cat fod raided for the third time by our resident dog/small horse, I went looking for a container that would be space saving and secure for storing food. This fit the bill perfectly. Now he is no longer able to have unauthorized snacks and I am saving money on expensive prescription cat food that he doesn't need to be eating. It holds about 30 pounds of cat food easily and has a samll footprint of floor space. I can't say enough good things about this. Try it for yourself and discover how great it is 
For the price, this bread box can't be beat. It's larger and roomer than we thought it would be - just right for bread, buns and an extra (bagels, muffins, cookies, etc.). Looks neat and nice on the counter. Well ventilated, too.  
these were exactly what I was looking for. The are tin and sturdy... I also cook eggs in them to make them round for the biscuits! Thanks! 
These Woven Cotton Blankets are Yummy!!! I want more!!! Elegant, soft, gorgeous and my new favorite blanket on our bed!!! We are blanket officionatos now--because we have lots and I've recently purchased even more different kinds of blankets. (I reviewed some of them as well) Woven Cotton blankets just look more expensive and decorative then other kinds of blankets. We rotate 5 different blankets on our King Size Bed to cover our down comforter and not only mix and match with the decor but to protect from the dirt or hair that we or our animals would deposit, while lounging. This Cotton Woven blanket would look good thrown over a couch or chair. I always get the most compliments on the looks of my cotton woven blankets, however, my WOOLRICH Down Throws are the most popular on our couches for warmth. This SAGE color is luscious. I recently purchased 2 different brands of SAGE and it's interesting how differently it can be interpreted. This one was more of a light apple color or peridot green. Ohhh soooo very pretty. The woven pattern is elegant on our bed and it makes the leaves pop from the sheets and the comforter, which is folded at the bottom. I love that it's lightweight yet heavy enough and is a high quality blanket. I usually buy blankets (we have need for many) at discount places but I found this to be well worth the great price offered here. It was free shipping too. One of my better purchases here through Amazon. My husband really likes it and he is a bit of a snob about blankets. Every time I walk in the room, I give a happy sigh. I hope this helps with your blanket purchases. 
I am a salad man. I like to cut ingrediants ahead of time and store. Salad Knife eliminates rust lettuce 
These knives are very easy to hold in your hand because of the rubber handles. They clean very easily and they are extremely sharp. They cut very well with very little effort 
Who me cooking? Yes, I thought it was about time I owned some knives that actually cut through all the way without pounding...I love the knives a lot actually...they look great, cut well and now when I watch Rachael Ray I can keep up .. 
I finally ordered this set after looking at it for months. It is fantastic. I use them every day. The handles are an added bonus. They do not slip even if your hands are wet. I am going to order the 7" knife also. If you can't make up your mind, buy it!!! 
I am enjoying these knives. I have wondered if I should not have gotten a bigger chef's knife. They do feel good in my hand. Even my almost 10 year old daughter wants to chop carrots with them! Actually, using good knives makes the food preparation and cooking just a little bit more exciting. Now, if only the sharpener would be delivered 
Can't beat the quality. Everything you will ever need to make the meals in the kitchen 
This knife set showed up under the tree this year and I am glad it did. The set is practical, incorporating the 3 most used knives in the kitchen. The paring knife is slightly larger than average and makes quick work of small vegetables, and fruits. The utility knife is versatile, extremely effecient, and saws neatly through just about anything. The East/West knife is a smaller rendition of a classic chef's knife with very good balance and smooth, precise cutting. It sliced through 75% frozen chicken like it was a warm knife through butter. The handles are extremely non-slip, comfortable, albeit a bit gaudy with the blaze orange coloring. The case is functional with handle grooves and silicone covered magnets to hold the blades in place. You could easily spend this on a quality chef's knife alone, but this set includes just that and 2 bonus knives making it a very nice bargain 
Recently my wife got rid of all the non-stick/Teflon dishes due to health concerns. We got this pan especially for cooking eggs etc. Although a little heavy, it is a excellent product and we are very happy with this. I did not give it 5 stars since I believe the handle could be a couple of inches longer and have something like a wooden "cover" to avoid overheating and make it convenient to manage. Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending this......you will not regret the buy! 
I just received it this morning. It looks really black and shiny so beautiful! After washing it with hot water only, patting it dry thoroughly, oiling it all over with vegetable oil I gave it a first try by frying an egg. It works better than my Teflon skillet!! Nothing stick on it!!! Excellent skillet!! 
This skillet is everything it is supposed to be w/cast iron, it performs GREAT 
Is not fully seasoned out of the box but within a short time will be a non-stick HIGH heat saute pan. Lighter in construction than other lodge pans it handles well. The casting ridges are not ground down but you will be using a potholder. Great tool period 
This is such a great pan for omlets because of the sloped sides that allow you to slide underneath. This would be a great first peice of cast iron for someone new to using it because of the size and it is pre-seasoned. I use it all the time it just keeps getting better 
Item was in a box, in perfect condition and delivered in 2 days 
It is adorable. We had a large picture just like this when I was a child so this is a special reminder of it. The minidisk pitcher is just the right size for an individual syrup pitcher for pancakes. I would love to have one in every color 
I absolutely adore Fiestaware and this color is wonderful...it's a brick redish tone. However, when I ordered it I didn't realize just how small it would be. I was imagining a creamer size pitcher and this is almost an individual size creamer. Similar to a size you'd get at a restaurant for your coffee. That having been said, the quality is wonderful, and it's Fiesta, so it's still worth 4 stars. A super piece to add to a Fiesta table 
This is the perfect little pitcher to own for serving creamer or milk for coffee or tea. It's a wonderful compliment to the rest of the Fiestaware line of serving items. Not only for everyday use, but also for parties. However, I do recommend that you order more than one if you do plan on using them for many people. Mix and match the colors for a beautiful table setting 
I have two of these and use them for sauces or dressings that pour easily. Thick or chunky items don't always pour so well, but cream, herbed olive oil, au jus, etc. work well. These are good for meals where a sauceboat is too big or where you'd like to have more sauce containers readily available to your guests rather than waiting for the gravy boat to get passed around and around so often 
I have this grill and use it 3-5 times a week to grill chicken or sandwiches. Works great, just warm it up for 5 minutes, pop on a sandwich or chicken, a few minutes later dinner's ready. Then, after it cools, you can pop out the grids for easy cleaning. 
This was an excellent purchase. The grids are removable and go right in the dishwasher without any impact to the non-stick coating. It has an audible timer which also shuts off the grill making it a great purchase for the elderly who might not hear the timer. This is the second time we've purchased the grill, we gave the first grill to our son after we'd used it for a couple of years (it was still like new and we'd used it a lot). We called around our local area looking for another HB grill and couldn't find one so we purchased a George Foreman. The features we were looking for, especially the timer that shut the grill off, were only available on the larger grills. We're cooking for two and really didn't want the "family size" grill so we left it in the box and pursued the HB until we found one on Amazon. We're now happy grillers again and hope they never stop making the HB with the features we love 
My mom has owned this grill for about a year and a half, and she and I ocassionally use it whenever we cook something on it. I find it to cook very effeciently and at a reasonable amount of time. It comes with a timer so you can cook your food at the time you feel that is needed. I cook a lot of food on this grill here (hot dogs, fish, beef patties). It also has a slot at the right side of the grill for the grease to run off of into a cup. I seem to notice some of the 2 star reviews (mainly one of the spotlight reviewers) complain about how small the grill is. I personally don't believe it is that small. Unless you have two jumbo burgers, or something to the equivulent on your grill, then you aren't much room (I cooked 5 on mine without any problem). Also my grill's non stick surface hasn't peeled off yet. Also I don't have a problem with the amount of time it takes my food to cook because of the fact that the heat cannot be adjusted. Seriously people, whats a couple of extra minutes going to do when cooking your food?? Are you that hungry enough that you have to compain about the grill taking longer to cook food? I personaly believe that the surfaces keep a reasonable amount of heat so you can cook your food without burning youself. You don't have to spray oil or put butter on the grill because of it's excellent non-stick surface. Another thing about this grill is that the surfaces comes apart so you can wash them or put them in the dishwasher. I find that to be very convient when cleaning the grill. This grill is very effective when cooking. I find it very useful when I'm trying to cook large amounts of food when I don't have enough room on the stove. This grill has made cooking very convient and much easier. If you want to compare this to the competition The George Forman Grill (one that we once had as well), I find this one to have many advantages. The only difference that I found is that Hamilton Beach grill has a timer and the plates can be taken off, while the George Forman grill can adjust the temperature. In response to one reviewer: You might want to thaw or defrost your food before you decide to cook it. That might explain why it took so to cook your beef patty. This grill wasn't specifically made to cook frozen food. In response to another reviewer: I've used this grill for quite a while, and didn't have any weird plastic smells while using it 
I bought this grill for my daughter in New York. I bought one a year ago and love to use it. Not only does it cook your food faster than other methods, it retains most of the juices that are cooked out of some foods by frying or baking. Clean up is a snap too! One button releases the plates and into the dishwasher they go! I would recommend this product very highly to people who enjoy great food! 
Just used this once but what a difference between this and my old George Forman grill. My old grill was such a pain to clean that I rarely used it. This grill is a breeze - just put the dirty parts in the dish washer. As for the grilling, it is on a par with my George Forman, which was excellent at cooking. I'm very happy. 
The grill works as good as its predecessor, but is smaller. Helpful for limited space. The removeable grids are great, but the slant to let grease drain out the side is too steep. Cannot use for pancakes because the batter slides off. And eggs are definetly out of the question. Also, the grease container come off very easily 
I use this little grill almost on a daily basis. I use it to grill up sandwiches or garlic toast. Even chicken for dinner or grill up a breast to mix up with some pasta for a quick meal. It's so convenient. The grills are very easy to keep clean and it looks great on my counter. I couldn't have picked a better product 
I want to speak up on behalf of Hamilton Beach indoor grills. I just ordered this 25295 model, which is my third in about a half-dozen years. It probably will last a few years, making that three in ten years. That's not bad at all. What went wrong with the one before this, the previous model 25285 with removable grids, is that the turn-off mechanism stopped being dependable. I noticed that my steak got overcooked, but thought it had been my fault for leaving it on too long. It wasn't until the next morning that I saw that the grill never shut itself off (eeek: stayed on overnight). So it's time for replacement -- after four years or so of constant use and perhaps some casual abuse. The model before that, replaced with the 25285 (for cleaning ease and because I wanted white), was given to my mother, who also got a few years of faithful, second-hand service. So that one too lasted about four years. I also gave one away as a present -- and its recipient, who had been suspicious of such contraptions and has a tiny kitchen, loved it and used it for years. Therefore, this is the fourth HB indoor grill that I've purchased. If you are single and don't have a lot of counter space, this is tough to beat -- particularly for less than $50 and no tax or shipping charges, and an easy return policy in addition to the one-year warranty. Before I bought the 25295, I checked out the George Foreman grills (including the "next generation"), Cuisinart, T-Fal, etc. Some of the others have some nice features that this model lacks -- such as temperature control, greater grilling area, floating hinge. But to me, that was offset by how much bulkier they are, oftentimes quite ugly IMHO, and not that much more bang for the buck. I really don't like it that some of the smaller GF models turn on only by being plugged in the wall. Maybe this is intended as a safety feature, but I wouldn't want to constantly have to mess with that. A power button should be essential, rather than considered a nicety for which they charge extra. This does a nice job with grilled sandwiches, meat and fish, sliced vegetables, etc. You get grill marks and it cooks everything right, after you learn the appropriate times for different types of food. It's cooked bacon fine, IMHO. It does quite nicely with frozen meat or veggie patties and chicken breasts. I particularly like to throw on a fairly thick frozen sirloin, or salmon or tuna steak. The outside gets browned, while the interior stays moist and lightly cooked (if you catch it in time). The reservoir cup holds a lot, so if you marinate the meat or fish and it drips, it's not a problem. If it's not essential to dispose of the fat that drips off and collects in the reservoir -- the ostensible purpose of indoor grills and still their prime marketing claim -- you can find ways to use it to baste the food during cooking (buy a second cup or find something else to use) or use it as the basis of gravy. Some reviewers have noted that the nonstick surface on the GF models flakes or chips off over time. These HBs hold up, but you do need to follow instructions. Wipe the grids clean while still warm and wash in the sink or dishwasher. Don't use cleaning products or tools that will strip off the nonstick covering, and use spray oil before grilling. Also, let the grill heat up 5 min before use, as per the directions. Food placed on hot surfaces sticks less than food that heats up with the surface (of course, such caramelization also enhances taste to some extent, so you may want to fiddle with this for your purposes, carefully scraping off the caramelized parts to avoid scratching the surface). If the grids get messed up, they can be replaced as long as the parts are manufactured, which probably will be for a while. The models I've purchased have made a tidy "footprint" on my countertop, and I know how to make it do what I need it to do. It wasn't worth it to spend maybe even twice as much for a few more bells and whistles, when I would be settling for a style that I dislike and losing half the counter space. Yes, it can be put away after use, but I like to have kitchen gizmos within easy reach, particularly if I like the way they look. The grill gets too much use to be constantly tucked away anyway. And this model matches my other stuff. If I had chrome appliances or did more entertaining or a larger counter area, I would've been seriously tempted by the Cusinart model, though, I have to admit. Therefore, I think some of the negative comments need to be taken in the context of maybe judging too quickly or nitpicking, needing a larger size grill for a family, preferring more features, using it incorrectly, etc. Neither I nor the people I know who have had HB indoor grills have had problems with melting plastic or plastic odors. HB makes the "Honda" of indoor grills. It's dependable rather than flashy, not big which matters for those with small kitchens, rates well with consumers and through independent tests, lasts for years, and isn't more than a one- or two- person household needs. Why pay (and pay for the electricity over time) for what you don't need? If your needs are modest, a modest indoor grill may well suit your purposes. I look forward to the new grill living up to the quality of its predecessors in my household 
Very easy to use and easy to clean, especially if I remember to spray the grill (as recommended) before preheating. I usually just soaked the grills briefly in hot, soapy water and they cleaned easily. They will go in the dishwasher, but I prefer to do them by hand since it's so simple. I found that I do need to clean the edges of the "cut out" oval where the grease runs into the drip pan, which I was not expecting. But, still easy enough. The hamburgers, turkey burgers and chicken breasts were cooked quickly and were very good, even though not the same as on an outdoor grill. For turkey burgers chicken, a sprinkle of paprika improves the color of the finished dish. I also plan to cook a few extra burgers next time for a quick reheat in the microwave with no clean up 
If you ask me, this appliance was designed and engineered with a little more thought that other similar retail products. Comparable electric grills in the same price range really don't offer the same options and features as the Hamilton Beach 25295 Express Indoor Contact Grill. While the higher end George Foreman Grills feature a similar size cooking surface and a digital timer, the Hamilton Beach's analogue timer works just as well. Personally, I can't imagine that digital over analogue in this instance could be of any importance. This grill is best used for grilling chicken breasts, meat paddies, and boneless cuts of meat. New users should be advised that electric indoor over/under grill do not produce the same sort of flavor in meat that you will get using an outdoor grill using charcoal and/or wood chips. The best way to make use of an appliance like this is to marinate most foods for at least an hour before grilling. Which brings me to one advantage of the Foreman Grill: In the past, a do-it-yourself VHS tape was among the accessories included with the GF grill. It was a thirty minute class on what to do with the grill and how to prepare recipes. With the Hamilton Beach Grill, you get a little pamphlet that has some recipes and descriptions of what sort of results to expect. It's too bad that there isn't more, but that's really the only downside. Maybe the grill doesn't get as hot as the Foreman Grill, but so what if it cooks a chicken breast in seven minutes instead of five? I thought the grill broke down easily for cleaning. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't notice any weird plastic smells when I was cooking, but then, maybe I didn't scrutinize this appliance as carefully. I'm not very good at picking flysh*t out of pepper, either 
I did a lot of research for pasta makers, both automatic and manual. I decided to try the Lello 2200. The first pasta (spaghetti) I made came out perfect and tasted delicious. It only took an hour from start to finish. If you are considering an automatic pasta maker, look no further! This machine is so easy to use. Just follow the directions, which are very complete and easy to understand. Making pasta has become fun using this machine. I can't wait to try the cookies and soft pretzels 
I did a great deal of research on the internet before buying an automatic pasta maker. I couldn't spend a fortune, but I wanted the best quality machine I could afford. I read too many reports of broken plastic extrusion discs, motors that burned out, etc. I learned that the Simac, Delonghi and Lello products were all related (so the quality of the older Simac brand seemed to be carried on in the newer Delonghi and Lello brands). I liked their metal extrusion discs and the durability of them. I felt a 2 lb capacity was ideal. I bought this one. I was not disappointed. I had read a great deal on the internet that the trickiest part is getting the dough consistency right. Most (if not all) of the negative reviews of all pasta machines center around this problem. When trying to decide which machine to buy, I do not recommend being influenced by reviews that focus entirely on this issue - that complaint is all about user error and has nothing to do with the quality or reliability of the machine. (Experienced makers of home made pasta need to understand that the dough will need to be a different consistency in this machine than when done the manual way.) I measured carefully and read the machine instructions very carefully (they bend over backwards to help you with this) and I didn't have any trouble getting pasta dough to extrude. I found that a 2lb capacity is more than I needed for a family of 3. I also felt that having metal extrusion discs is valuable in that when you trim the dough as it extrudes, you really run your knife against that metal a lot (in order to help get a clean cut). I can imagine a plastic disc would wear considerably faster under those circumstances. (You literally slice and slice hundreds of times for the smaller pastas - like elbows and such.) I would highly recommend this machine. I was impressed by its quality and usefulness. You will not regret your purchase with this one 
This machine is totally a waste of time, you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes, you would make the pasta in 4-5 hours. The mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture. After lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture, you get the second problem, the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want b/c is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole. If you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self, or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge. 
If I could have given this product a negative score, I would have. I purchased the Lello 2200 Pastamaker for my daughter for Christmas. She had just finished a culinary arts program and was quite keen on making homemade pasta. The day after Christmas, we added the ingredients, plugged the machine in, and nothing. After some investigation, my husband who is an engineer concluded that the micro switch needed some adjustment. He proceeded to make the adjustment so that the product would run. Our second and last try with this machine was tonight. The switch worked perfectly, thanks to my husband. The kneading of the dough worked fine as well. Nothing beyond that point worked at all. Specifically, we couldn't get the dough to pass through the bottom of the machine through the disk. Rather, the dough just spun around the bowl. My daughter has made fresh pasta numereous times before and therefore knows what the consistency should be. However, just in case she had it wrong, she added a bit more water. Still nothing. We finally ended up taking the dough and putting it through a meat grinder to form the pasta. Bottom line, the Lello 2200 Pastamaker went out in the trash tonight. I not only wasted some money on this piece of junk, but also wasted a fair amount of time trying to work with a total piece of junk. 
Love it! Simple...easy...makes great pasta...fun! No problems with it...sturdy and heavy duty...highly recommend it 
Pruduct arrived in a timely manner , well packaged and as advertised 
these glasses don't have the heft or size to accomodate a serious whisky drinker. Cute juice glasses, but not a cornerstone to your bar collectio 
After purchasing a set of Spiegelau's Bordeaux wine glasses several months ago, and being very impressed with their quality and price, I decided to order a set of their rocks glasses. Once again, the product delivered to my door is of exceptional quality and very nicely priced. The look is elegant and simple. The glass is well weighted, with a thick base tapering nicely to a thin rim. My only problem with these glasses is that they make me want to add another set of Spieglau's many styles to my kitchen . . . and I'm running out of space. I won't be able to resist temptation very long . . . and I think I'll be ordering the highball glasses next 
Having become enamored of these fine--elegant but durable--glasses at the bar at Sea Ranch, CA, I am delighted to find I can buy a set of my own so affordably. I look forward to sipping less well-traveled bourbon from them 
We received these glasses as a wedding gift through our registry. When washing the glasses for the first time, my wife cut her finger on a 3mm sharp spur defect protruding from the bottom inside surface of the glass. Almost invisible on casual inspection, but quite nasty to be cut by. 
I replaced my old oven thermometer since the small print had become difficult to read w/o glasses. This one is very easy to read and shows the same accuracy as my old one. As with other MIU products, I'm very pleased with the high quality and the low cost. 
This is the best flatware I have ever purchased. It is HEAVY and large. There is a distinct difference in size between salad and regular folks and the soup spoons are outsized (it is hard to tell from the pictures). I have had $120 sets of Oneida and the Wallace has them beat. We have very hard water and after a month of diswashering, their luster has not dulled. I would recommend these to ANYONE although Amazon's "original" price of $210 is a tad inflated - even Macy's regular price is $110 
Gave as a gift and she really liked it. So far, so good 
This spice rack saves space in my kitchen cabinet, and makes finding spices while I'm cooking SO much easier. I have had no problems with the quality of the materials or breakage, and I use it daily. I plan on buying another 
An outstanding piece of kitchen cookware. It looks and performs exactly like All Clad for about 1/4 the price. It cooks exceptionally well AT MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURES THAN YOU ARE ACCUSTOM TO. Because of the aluminum center/core, there is very uniform heat throughout the pot, including the sides. The handles can get hot (because they are close to the body of the pot) while boiling with a gas stove, but otherwise are non-hot pad cool. Don't believe the reviews about hard to clean, food sticks etc. It is *(%. In my opinion these reviewers don't know how to use the cookware properly. If you are brazing/browning, use a small shot of Pam (I have tried al types of oils, but this works best) and make sure that the temperature ~ 25% less than normal. Also, Bar Keepers Friend, as recommended in the users manual, is perfect for making the inner and outer surfaces shine. It is non-abrasive. This pot is the perfect size for soups, large quantities of sauces, and roasts. It is more manageable than the 8 Q one that comes with the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set. I use it more often than the larger pot. Fantastic product and great value. I bought it for 1/2 price on Amazon in December 2006. 
I burnt my last stockpot (an inexpensive RevereWare) and needed a replacement. I seriously thought about buying a new full set, they're always just a tad more than a single piece. I'm glad I didn't. This stockpot is just the right size, and doesn't come in any prepackaged group. What I really like is the even heating and the 18/10 stainless steel weight. It's probably my imagination, but I swear food cooked in it tastes better than before 
I paid only a small amount of money for this heater and it works fine. The thermostat is a little off, but I can mle adjustments 
We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead. The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting. End result: Don't waste your money. There's no way of knowing if you'll get a dud 
I bought one of these last year and am using it again this winter. This heater is rather quiet for a fan-type although powerful at 1500W. The thermostat isn't very accurate, but then it was only designed to keep a personal space at a certain temperature, which it does well. You would need two of these to keep a small apartment near a specific temperature; otherwise set this heater to 5 deg. above desired temp. The heater it replaced was a 600W radiant heater which failed just weeks after purchase. Eventually I decided the fan/hot-air heater could not completely replace the kind of direct warmth I get from radiant units, so now depending on my activity I alternate between the Holmes and a newer 900W carbon-FIR heater made Honeywell. Fan-type heaters usually annoy me, but this one doesn't and it turned out better than I thought it would. I think this one would have rated 5 stars if it had a gradually-adjustable thermostat instead of digital presets 
My heater worked fine, except it never heats the room to the temperature i select. It is always five or more degrees cooler. Not very pleased! Don't waste your money. 
I inherited this heater and admit that I wanted it for sentimental value but I love it now! Having the ability to target a particular temperature is great, I wouldn't want a heater without that feature. What I would like is the ability to point the airstream up or down in addition to swiveling on the base. It is wonderfully light and compact and feels very safe. Though looks aren't important to me this little unit is more attractive than many others I've seen 
Though not a large heater it heats up a room as good or better than the space heater I use more than twice as big. The one touch button operation takes a little time to get used to,but all in all I consider this to be an Excellent Little Heater 
What a gorgeous set!!! You won't regret buying this. It is better that the 2 pieces seperate that way you won't have to bring the whole plate over to refill dip or coctail sauce. The plate is so thick and shaped beautifully. Very artistic line 
I purchased this item online in September of 2003 and while i have only used it once for entertaining I use the bowl all the time for almost anything. Since it's made of glass it can match any table setting and the glass is very sturdy. 
I bought this in a pinch for entertaining and have really fell in love. I had been searching for a Chip and dip set that did not have the bowl attatched and was unable to find one until now. The bowl is generously sized and the platter holds enough chips/crudites for at least 5 people to snack heavily. Another thing is that the glass is thick and fits nicely in the dishwasher. I also like that it is simple b/c it is able to go with any decor 
My order arrived in a timely fashion as promised however when I opened the carefully packed box the glass funnel in my `Wine For Later Decanter Set' was broke. A quick email to The Wine Enthusiast Co.'s customer service rep, Cheryl Nadler, and two days later a complete replacement `Wine For Later Decanter Set' was delivered to my door step. Now I have no excuse not to open two bottles of wine `for later'!! Great products and excellent customer service. 
I have been using my Wine for Later set for over a year and recommend it highly. I can open a bottle, drink one glass, and the wine I transfer to the carafes keep indefinitely! It works much better than the vacuum stoppers I previously used 
I ordered these after finally giving in and buying my dream espresso machine and I am just in as in love with these cups as I am with the machine itself! Not only are they durable and functional but they are classy and cute! They are a lot of fun and I enjoy using them every day 
These are wonderful cups, just the right size and hold in the warmth very well. All this and a uplifting set of graphic designs. Everyone who gets served espresso at our house compliments us on the cups. Functional and beautiful! GO FOR IT 
I gave these to my son and girlfriend for Christmas. They just LOVED these and she wants a whole set of dishes in this pattern 
I ordered these as a gift and love them. There are 6 different patterns and you can use them as a set or mix and match. They are sturdy and seem very durable 
cooks soft boiled eggs perfectly every time. i use it daily and have put one at son's home for when i visit 
Riedel makes the finest wine glasses in the world. I can't quite step up to pay for the Sommelier series, but the Vinum doesn't disappoint. The glasses have a nice weight, and they look fantastic 
I must admit that I don't know much about wine and I never thought the glass could make the difference. Wine is wine, no matter what you drink it from, or so I thought, but boy, was I wrong! I borrowed a couple of different glasses from my local store just to see if it was really worth it to have separate glasses for the different grape varieties...and the answer is yes! Yes! YES! I tried the same wine in different glasses at home, seevral ordinary glasses, even mugs, and then in the wrong and finally in the right Riedel. It was an average priced wine, but when enjoyed from a Riedel glass it became an almost heavenly experience. I sat the whole evening enjoying the colour, inhaling the bouquet, looking at the wine flowing in my glass...after 6 hours I still wasn't even halfway through a bottle...it was really something extraordinary. Normally, I finish a bottle in a matter of 3 hours or so, but this was too good to be gulped and forgotten. The guys at Riedel got this one right, that's for sure. The cleaning however takes a certain skill. It's a very delicate affair, especially since this glass has a wide belly and a rather narrow opening for male-sized hands, making it very difficult to reach inside with a linen cloth for drying. 
I am a firm believer in the use of this stemware for burgundies and pinots of distinction. But beware - this glass will make lesser wines unravel at the seams. As an example, I recently discovered a $15 Oregon pinot that I found quite pleasant. After sampling this wine from Bordeaux/cabernet wine glasses at a friend's house, I found this wine quite nice and decided to buy several bottles. However, after trying it in the Burgundy glass, which has a wider bowl which allows more aromas to escape, as well as a more narrow lip that traps and concentrates the bouquet, the wine smelled alcoholic, acidic, and medicinal. The moral of the story: use this for your premier cru and grand gru burgundies and other well-crafted pinots, which have infinite layers of aroma and complexity to discover. Avoid the lesser burgundies and pinots out of this glass and try them in something that is more forgiving 
Ok, I'm wary of everyone that will read this and, like me in the past, think anyone who believes the glass wine is consumed from can have a bearing on it's taste and enjoyment...but IT DOES! Try them, you'll see. I especially love the thin almost flexible nature of the rim of each glass. Cheers 
Good glasses, great for Barolo and Barbaresco in addition to Burgundies. My only complaint is that the stem is that these glasses are a little short 
I've been using this glass for years now ... I agree it's one of the best all around for enjoying a myriad of wine types .. 
They are huge, and this is not indicated in the product description. Buy them if you want gigantic wine glasses. I am returning mine 
Not only do these wine glasses vastly improve the aroma and taste of Burgundy (my favorite) and Pinot Noir, they make all red wines smell and taste better, including Bordeaux and Cabs and most Italian and Spanish wines I've used them for. My average-priced everyday Cab is much improved in these wine glasses--it tastes like a much more expensive wine 
Not quit what was in the picture but still pleased with the purchase 
this thing is the biggest waste of money i have ever seen 
I have used other kitty litter mats but this is the first on that eliminates that dreaded kitty litter spread 
Eesy to use, clean by vacuum cleaner. Less trush in the bathroom. I have no regrets about this purchase 
The reason I bought this mat was for exactly that! Helping to keep litter from the general area of the litter pan. I think it must be far more comfortable for my cats then standing on scattered litter. However, you know felines! One of my cats is Afraid to step on it but steps Over it. It is comfortable on their pads. I actually use one outside my apartment door with a bed for strays on top. It's just the right size and the bed never gets wet or dirty this way. Glad I got two 
I have had many different paw mats in the past and found this one to work the best. For one it is not ment for human feet, it and is not ment to feel good either on your feet since it is plastic. It is there to help REDUCE cat litter from getting all over the floor. I have also found that if you place the mat about two maybe three inches from the cat box that my cats will use it when they are done and not try to leap over it like some views have mentioned. It does also help when you are cleaning the cat box to clean out the mat of litter to otherwise it will not work effectively, just a couple shakes in the garbage bag will do the trick. I have had mine now for a couple of years now and it is the only mat that I find that works best for my two cats. 
I thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly eye-sore. It also hurts to walk on with bare feet. Having wood floors, I hate sweeping 3-4 times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box, so I thought I'd give it a try. Helped some, but overall I'd say not worth the money 
Unfortunately, this pan is no longer sold as an open stock item, and can only be found in sets, such as the 8- and 13- piece sets. Fortunately, I was able to buy it from a Marketplace seller for a very agreeable amount of $50. However, I do see that Amazon is selling it for $150, which is vastly inflated, but takes into account the fact that it can't be obtained without buying the 13 piece, $399 set. This pan is just the right size for sauteeing, stir frying, you name it. It's not huge like it's big brother, the 5 qt. saute pan, but is suited to most normal cooking. The walls are deep enough to contain many dishes, which is nice. It's a bit heavy to hold one-handed (better for those fore-arm muscles!), and I appreciate the addition of a small handle on the other side. Of most importance is its lid, for some reason, which Calphalon does not sell separately. It can fit snugly over this pan, the wok, the 10" omelette pan, AND the 8 qt. stockpot. Hey, it even fits some of my old pots as well. Thus, increasing the worth of this item. Really, a terrific addition to any kitchen. A note about cleaning- after extended use, there will be tarnishing and brown blemishes (at least on my gas range). To get rid of these, do NOT use Bon Ami because it's too gentle and doesn't get rid of stains. Best way to go is Barkeeper's Friend, about $2.50 at your local supermarket, or Cameo Stainless Steel Cleaner. However, Cameo is more abrasive than Barkeeper's Friend, and WILL reduce the mirror polish of these pans. Barkeeper's is the way to go- remember to ALWAYS rub in a circular manner- back and forth will scratch the surfaces 
I use this heater to heat our sun porch turing the spring and fall, as well as take the chill out of the basement for my morning workouts during the winter - it does a great job, although it is kinda small. If you need to warm up a room-sized area (I'd say up to 16 x 16), this is a wonderful, reasonably priced unit 
It's quick to heat up and heat is intense, perfect for small room/office. However, the temperature control doesn't work very well so it can get very hot and dry 
I bought this heater for my office, which being in an old turn-of-the-century building tends to have a hard time staying warm in Winter. I've got a few Honeywell air purifiers at home working, so I stuck with this manufacturer for this purchase. I'm glad I did. PROS: it heats my office (10x15) quickly and maintains the desired temperature; controls are easy to use; it's small and easily placed out of the way. CONS: the fan is a little noisy; wish it came in black like most of the other appliances and items in my office. I'd recommend this little space heater for anyone with similiar needs 
1. When I open the box. Found there is a loose screw in the heater. Meaning the product quality control has problem. 2. There is no handle to hold the heater. 3. There is no second heat temperature selection 
The heater is much smaller than what I expected, but it really heat the room efficiently. And it has a good price which is easy to see. However, it causes a little bit noise and electricity unstable (1500W) while working 
when I first plugged it in it had a problem and shut down. Something with it's saftey system I'm sure. After unplugging it and a five minute wait, it worked perfectly and seems to be fine 
The heater is quite good. My only complaint is that there is no real temperature control. It has an ON-OFF control. Whenever it is ON, it blasts the full heat. The ON period can be controlled (probably also the fan speed), nothing else. However, for its price, it is a good piece 
I have never had an electric heater before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Especially when I heard so many horror stories about electric heaters starting home fires. However, I wanted a small heater to use on my legs and feet when I am sitting at my computer. Being that the heater is a Honeywell, I figued I couldn't gone wrong with it and I bought it on sale so the price was cheap. I can not raved highly enough about this heater. It is so small and yet it heats up my whole bedroom, which I was not expecting. I can pick it up and take it to any room or place where I need it. It truely is the mouse that roared. When I read others who reviewed this heater, their biggest complaint was that there is no off and on switch. This is true. But, I wouldn't want to leave it plugged in when I am not using it anyway...just to be on the safe side. Buy it you won't regret it 
Tried this in all my Emerilware Stainless Pans and it won't fit any of them. I had to send it back 
The 3 quart steamer does not fit in the 3 quart pan 
The size of this tray is not 7 X 4 X 1. It is larger than this. I think Amazon should revise this with correct sizes. many times, products details are not accurate. I hope Amazon could improve on this a little better. 
The tray is beautiful. I bought it for a christmas present. Anyone who is collecting this pattern should be pleased. Additionally I have looked at many sites to get the best price on the pattern and amazon was the cheapest 
I see nothing special with this sharpener. Used it on a santuko knife with passible results. Tried using my sharpening steel on that knife and got the same results. The steel seems to be more versitile 
I already had two like this (and 4 CD racks of the same style), but the store where I got them wasn't selling any more. This one is the exact same brand so it matches perfectly. You can hang it vertically or horizontally (which holds more discs) 
Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain. The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. This pan holds 2 1/2 quarts of food, measures 7 3/4 x 11 1/2 inches internally, and weighs 6 1/2 pounds. 2 1/2 quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. This may be the pan for families from 2-4. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot.  I find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese, while not so desirable for other dishes. Add the Le Creuset 7 1/2 x 9 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease. Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles, pork chops covered with cornbread dressing, dinner rolls, baked squash, scalloped potatoes, cobblers, pineapple upside down cake, or bread pudding. The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination. One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. PROS: Extremely versatile Efficient absorption and distribution of heat Hygienic enamel cooking surface Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors Easy to clean when not abused or misused Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table Can easily last a lifetime CONS: Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 6 1/2 pounds 
I was very excited about this product when I ordered it, unfourtunatly the product didn't meet my expetations. It is extreamly slow, much slower than a George Foreman which really surprised me. Also, as another reviewer wrote it is very messy, I never appreciated the design of a foreman until I used this, the sides of the Cuisinart do not extend past the cooking surface much so they don't block any spray and when you open the griddler any condensation or food residue can slide off the back onto your counter because of where it is hinged. In conclusion get a foreman 
The product looks great, takes up very little space, it is easy to clean and works like a charm 
I read all reviews on the remanufactured GR 4 Griddler by Cuisinart. Yes mine had a few cosmetic blemishes that is to be expected nothing major though, I wont complain I paid 70.00 off the original price. I have used the griller to make flat bread , pancakes, steaks, chicken, sandwiches and veggies. I could not be happier its easy to clean and heats up in a instant. My only complaint is when using the griddle both sides heat up and you don't have the option to only use one side. I love Cuisinart and they never fail to impress me with the workmanship 
I bought this remanufactured grill last month and it arrived in brand-new condition. I have used it a number of times and am very pleased with it so far. I have been hand washing the grill plates after reading about them peeling after a year. I am being very careful with them. This is definitely easier to clean than the Deni I had before 
I couldn't be more pleased with this remanufactured product. It exceeds my expectations for both quality and ease of use. Any negative reviews have to be biased by some very isolated situation. We have used both the griddle and the panini/grill. It makes absolutely wonderful burgers, chicken, sausages and sandwiches. The ease it clean-up is nothing short of amazing. This was a real bargain and I advise anyone who is thinking about it to grab it 
I had a George Foreman unit, but the non-stick coating wore off very quickly. This unit is great, and much more versatile. What sold me were the removable grill plates 
The Griddler arrived in a timely manner and in excellent shape. My family uses it 4-5 times a week and we all think it has been one of our best purchases 
This rebuilt grill works well. Comes with 2 pairs of grilling plates that are easy to switch and/or clean. This is a large unit so it is more difficult to store 
I can't say enough about this little machine it makes cooking fun again and all the food taste like your dining out. I have made so many different sandwiches using flat breads tortias, loaf bread etc. all taste great . I have grilled steaks chops, shrimp, chicken and veggies. The griddle makes a nice amount of pancakes at the same time. The heat up time is very fast and clean up is even faster. If for some reason my griddler were to wear out I would absolutly buy another. I would recommend you try it. 
Received this item a couple of weeks ago. It's hysterically funny (although my ex-husband doesn't think so). The knives are nice quality and you just can't beat the feeling of satisfaction when you shove one back in it's place! Bigger than I thought it was going to be but I'm o.k. with that.Everyone who has seen it goes nuts. For mne, this was a great buy 
This is a wonderful piece of modern design. Iconic and hilarious. The holder is made of hard plastic. I wish it were made of something like shiny vinyl on the outside, though. I think it'd be more protected against falls if it were. The knives, in my opinion, aren't as great as the other reviewers are saying. Mine have already started to get rust stains in some places so the "stainless" in stainless steel isn't quite up to snuff. They keep their edge as well as an average supermarket knife would. I haven't taken mine to a knife sharpener yet to see how well they'll take a refinishing. However, the point of this thing is the holder. And that is completely worth it. It always grabs attention in the kitchen. Even the construction guys working on our renovation laughed. If you're looking for a serious voodoo toy, this isn't it. The knives do not go in an out of the sheath holes so easily that you'd actually want to play with it 
This was a great product at a great price. It is definitely a conversation starter for guests. The knives are excellent quality too. This purchase was a steal 
Feeling sick already just by looking at this! Not a very funny joke! Don't believer in fung-shuei, but this is just not a good luck symbol for any place 
I bought this for a current partners xmas pressie after he found out recently during our relationship all that his ex wife had got up to during theirs. I'm not sure how much something like this really helps to get over a painful relationship, but at the end of the day if you can get a laugh at their expense then it's worth it's weight...and it sure makes a great conversation piece. Great quality knives too, however we have decided to keep ours more of an object d'art, as you do have to be careful when replacing the knives in their slots that their ends dont scratch the holder. Great price too @ $60 here compared to over $150 locally where I initially considered buying it 
I first saw this in a magazine at the Hair Salon I go to and it brought a smile to my face. Hilarious I think people will get a kick out of this. This was gift to my daughter who loved it and said the knives are well made the holder is a good size. Great conversation piece 
Not only is this piece cool lookin, but the knives it comes with are excellen 
This is by far the coolest gift I have ever purchased. The recipient hasn't stopped talking about it yet. She says somedays it's the "Ex" and somedays it's the "Boss". I asked her if the knives were any good and she said "Who cares!!" It is such a conversation piece and has provided endless joy! BTW, the knives are just fine 
These are on sale at my local store for $160.00. The price offered here is fantastic. They come in several colors, the chrome being a bit more expensive because it looks finer than the plastic. Red, black, white, and even apple green. All but the chrome look are very plastic and look plastic up close, but dont be disappointed with that, because they still look awesome. The red has the advantage of being blood colored. I recommend these (Im a picky buyer too). GREAT gift. I'm glad I didnt buy a set at my local store 
The best surprise is the evenly toasted crunchy surface of the toast with just the right amount of moisture left in the center of the bread. I also am very pleased with the design. It looks like a little proofing box for rising dough. Very unique 
This is our third SK-7 toaster oven. We use ours daily. They seem to have a useful life of around 10 years and then the elements start to flake out. Very compact and versatile, given the size. In a small kitchen they are a life saver. Highly recommend 
I have purchased 6 Sanyo Space Saving Toaster Ovens -four toasters for other people that made a point of saying they wished they had one. I like the even toasting, they abiity to make open-face sandwiches, and the ability to toast or heat food with a variety of thicknesses. I own two toasters - one in a vacation rental in Fl and have had several people ask "where they can I get THAT TOASTER". I wish it came in more colors 
At 950 watts and with a footprint of less than 1 sq ft, this is especially suited for a studio apartment or for a kitchen with limited counter space and a limited number of electric circuits. It's also a true gem to put in a guestroom breakfast bar, or a vacation cottage, if you are lucky enough to have either one. It works well for an elderly relative in assisted living. (Contrary to what the technical specifications state, this appliance does have an automatic shut-off feature. The timer shuts off after 15 minutes.) As a toaster, it's relatively slow but it's versatile. E.g., it handles bagels better than a regular toaster, warms up pastries nicely, and you can toast on only one side. On the down side, toasting anything DOES take longer, as another reviewer noted; this may be because it has what appear to be "light bars" instead of metal heating coils or rods. So, no, it's not a down-sized equivalent of an oven, or even a toaster oven. The temperature control is set in the vicinity of 375 F. You can't broil, but you CAN bake just a few cookies. Whether you use one of the refrigerated rolls of cookie dough, or make your own batch of cookie dough, you can freeze the left-overs or divide the whole batch into in pre-cut portions. Then bake 2-4 cookies while you prepare dinner. (What an aroma, to have them fresh! and no temptation later.) You can also let the kids/grandkids take out a portion, and bake them. A bonus is that the Toasty also makes superb English muffin pizza--no soggy bottoms, like in the microwave. I also like it for melting cheese on toast. It also reheats a single slice of pizza very nicely. About replacement pans and clean up: You can buy one of the thinner style silicone baking liners (be sure it's 100% silicone, with no fillers) for a small pan and cut it to size for each of the pans. Clean up is VERY easy then, and since the liners are reusable, it's cheaper in the long run than lining the pans with aluminum foil. If you are, or have, a handy person around, you can also custom trim a couple of unglazed baking tiles to make your own little pizza oven. SUMMARY: Downside is that it's slower than a toaster, more limited than a toaster-broiler oven, and a tad pricey. But it's small and it's cute! NOTE: To find a silicone mat without fillers, just bend it. If it turns white, the mat contains fillers, and it should not be cut 
I bought this for the space-saving feature, which is terrific (and it looks good). I expected a toaster oven but it is really only a toaster -- it could use a little more power so that it would toast more quickly, but eventually it gets the job done 
This toaster is definitely a space saver. There are a few things you need to know to get great food out of it though, for toast I turn the oven on before I get the bread out so that it is at a good temp when I put the slices in. If you want to bake something or toast a baguette sandwich just use the bottom burner. I like how the shelves come out when you open the door, it makes retrieving your food so much easier. All in all, it takes a few tries to adjust to this toaster oven, but it makes up for the initial awkward period by being so cute and small. I'm very happy with my purchase. 
This toaster is great! It's a real space saver with big toaster power. This seller is wonderful too. Packed with care and received quickly and safely! A+ to all 
We've had the super toasty for about one month. Very good for our needs. Toasts very well, evenly and quickly. Perfect small size for our counter. Matches well with our black and chrome applicanes. No temperature setting is the only drawback. But we don't miss that much. 
These days, it's hard finding a simple toaster oven. Most of them are huge, have convection capability and complicated digital displays, etc. Not the Sanyo Toasty. I like it because it's very compact, tall rather than wide, and looks good in my retro kitchen. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it looks like something your dentist would use to sterilize drill bits, but he's getting used to the Toasty's offbeat design. It toasts bread and bagels just fine. Yes, there's no heat setting and others have complained about that. That drawback doesn't bother me. As long as you're not looking to heat up large or long items, the Toasty is fine 
Works great. simple to operate. Just what I needed for my contemporary kitchen. Small but efficient 
This item is acually rated for 900 total pounds, but it seems a little flimzy to me. I already had one shelving unit that I bought from a local store that is much beefier, but was not much more expensive. I loaded this unit up with items in my garage and it is holding, but I don't fully trust it. The side supports are a little too thin and it is just a bit wobbly. I am going to anchor it to the wall, but I really shouldn't have to do that. Also, the edges are very sharp. I would recommend wearing gloves while assembling. The instruction sheet did warn of this, but really.....how many people actually read the instructions 
I love it, it was easy to assemble and very sturdy too, I am looking forward to purchasing another one soon, you will not be disappointed 
It is ideal for storage. It is not very attractive, but very useful 
The shelving I purchased was a big step in my being able to organize my garage. The shelving was a "snap" to put together. They were assembled in about 10 minutes, no tools needed. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get organized 
The construction and stability of this unit is sub par at best. Save yourself the trouble and go to Home Depot and get their Storage Unit-it is much better quality and is about the same price 
Besides being heavy and bulky, putting this together wasn't too bad. Once you have the first shelf or two in place, it's all downhill from there. It's been a while, but I don't remember cutting myself. This one is more stable and squared off than another one I bought with all metal shelves--that kind of shelves can bend in the middle, and I had a terrible time getting them square!! An added benefit is the fiberboard material--I stained it dark blue and coated it with a few coats of polyurethane, so it looks really nice and the shelves will last longer. I'm buying two more to expand 
I just purchased a second unit. I went together easily. I did not have any problems with assembly and did not receive any cuts while assembling it bare handed 
Very wobbly, and sharp edges on the edges of the shelves. I cut myself bad enough to require stitches on the underside of the shelf. I don't recommend 
What a great product for dog food. I wish they made one smaller for cat food. Definitely would buy one. And, you can't beat the price. Petsmart shipped really fast 
After waiting for a month for this to come, I opened the box and found it to be broken. Most pot racks are riveted together to make them stronger, but the cross pieces on this one are just welded in with a very small weld, which was broken in shipping. Fortunately, it was broken when I received it, rather than hanging it and having all of my pots and pans come crashing down and break my tile counter. This is obviously a cheap pot rack and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
I ordered two sets of the dinnerware and upon arrival , about 4 bowls, 2 salad plates, and a dinner plates were cracked, chipped, etc. However, Amazon made it extremely easy to get the whole boxed returned and replaced with a new set. Unfortunately the new set had one broken item in it. But I figured, one was a lot better than 8. The set itself is excellent. They are versatile with any decorative theme and clean up great in the dishwasher. 
Le Creuset cast-iron products really conduct the heat and are great products to have in the kitchen. One drawback, they can be difficult to clean. If you sear meat or fry, burnt remnants cannot be removed. Overnight soaking will help but you cannot use soft scrub or hard scrubbers on the enamel. The product still functions well, it just does not look as nice as an expensive piece of cooking gear should be! Would buy it again 
This is one versatile pan, I was pleasantly surprised with its size. I can easily feed 4-5 people , everything I made came out delicious,clean-up is effortless.The pan is gorgeous,this is my first le crueset and won't be my last.It is pricey but it will last a long time 
This is a large casserole but quite wide and flat- great for somethings like paella but not good for anything very runny or requiring long slow cooking. It is a great extra but doesn't replace a big deep casserole which I had to buy additionally 
This is a wonderful casserole! It makes me happy just to look at this beautiful pot, let alone cook with it! I highly recommend Le Creuset to anyone who love's to cook. It's a pot you'll have for a lifetime 
I can't beleive anyone would just use this for serving - it's a very useful size, great for searing meats and then roasting in the oven, rice dishes, etc. The pan is not heavy, the lid is a killer, but I think that helps in braising 
I really do not understand all the fuss about this range, I can only assume that because these rather silly pots and pans have a french name that people somehow equate that with cuisine quality. I received a casserole as a gift, which was lovely, they look good and have a snob value and cache. But they are truly awful! they dry out food too quickly, they are pure evil to try and clean and they are ridiculously heavy! you could give yourself a hernia hauling one out of the oven. My advice is forget the hype and stay practical in the kitchen! Incidently, mine is used as heavy and special occassion only, tureen; a lot of money to shell out for a not very practical serving dish 
I love this piece of Le Creuset. It's just beautiful, and so easy to clean up 
I do alot of 'experimental' cooking and have found this dish consistently superior in it's ability to deliver even heat and add to the cooking process. It is the perfect size for a family of 3 or more who also want 'leftovers' for lunch the following day. It cleans up very easily and is always presentable enough to carry a favorite meal to a special event 
This casserole accommodates everything from a whole roaster chicken (ok, a smaller one) to duck confit to risotto. I appreciate being able to use this pot on the range and in the oven . . . great for Osso Bucco! It's nice for entertaining and for slow cooking. Highly recommended 
This pan gets used more than any other Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Stainless pan in my kitchen. I love the size and use it for a wide variety of food preparation. The clean up is so easy. 
I don't know if this item is for kid's lunch or what. The bag itself is small, and the mug is even smaller! Frankly speaking, I can't think of any use of it with this size, except maybe put in coffee. But then why bother using this mug? A regular mug can be much more convenient to hold. Anyway, I just returned it. Regardless how much it costs, it has to be at least useful! 
The mug alone costs 6.99, so the kit for 16.99 is a bargain. I love the mug size, its handle and vent lid. I would prefer an on and off button for the warmer, but it does keep my coffee warm. I don't know if I'll ever use the lunch bag but it is well made 
This set of shot glasses has this vintage look that I adore. The different engraved design on each piece make these glasses look so unique, just like little jewels that'll make you want to display them somewhere. Plus when you are entertaining your guests will always know wich glass is theirs. Give it a shot and buy them 
I got these for a friend for Christmas. They shipped quickly and are really neat shot glasses. I kind of want to get some for myself 
I love this glasses, actually I bought the whole set of this style of glasses, white wine, red wine, martini, water and shot glasses they have very unique style 
This pan has been excellent; I have used it mostly for omelettes and frittatas. One thing to note. Despite the current desription, the pan DOES NOT come with a glass lid. Otherwise, it cleans easily. It appears to be made in Toledo, not China. 
Well its working really good, I think for compact refrigerator this is the best choice 
For the most part, this refridgerator has done a good job keeping the drinks cold, and the size is reasonable: small on the outside, big on the inside, perfect for the dorm room. The interior is sound and the temperature is very cold, even on the minimum setting. So why did it lose three stars? Because of one minor flaw, and one serious problem. The minor flaw is that while the fridge keeps the things inside cold, the top and sides get uncomfortably warm. Not enough to set anything on fire, but definitely not the thing you want to put your bare hand on for long. Good if you want to keep lunch warm though. As for the serious problem-- the pipe in the back gets really, really cold. After running this for three weeks, my mother noticed that the fridge was leaking water. Upon further inspection, I noticed that it wasn't a leak...it was water dripping from MELTING ICE THAT HAD FORMED around one of the pipes in the back of the fridge, just outside of the insulation that had wrapped around the pipe. The chunk was about an inch and a half in diameter, and looked like a chunk of white foam wrapped around the pipe. It took me 15 minutes to ease the ice off, then as I was inspecting the pipe under the insulating cover, another chunk of ice popped out. All told, it took about 20 minutes to get the mess handled, but I'm glad my mother noticed the water dripping when she did, otherwise, I fear that the fridge might have short circuited and cost us $100 in the process. 
I had been wanting a compact refrigerator for awhile now. Finally decided to get one -- and I must say this is a fine choice. The first thing I noticed about it was it was a little bigger then I expected for some reason. But it is relativly light and movable. One thing I really like about it is the look, the front is stainless steel, with the 2 sides and top being a very nice looking glossy black. Inside the Fridge is pretty roomy. Well, as roomy as a Mini-Fridge can be anyways. Now on to the operation. It gets really cold, and I keep it at the setting of 3. It goes all the way up to 7. It's got a nice little ice tray on the top which is a nice feature...although the little freezer tray does seem to get some frost build up over time, which I'm not really a fan of. Also, the Fridge is not loud at all -- at first I noticed it being on just because I wasn't used to having a compact Fridge in my room. But soon after I forgot it was even there. All in all, this Fridge is a very nice product and the price is supurb. For $100, I was expecting it to look and operate somewhat clunky, but I was pleasently suprised at it's good looks and quiet operation. I recommend it 
We have the refrigerator by our computer.We keep can drinks in it.It works great. We are very pleased 
I bought this for my office. I looks great, and works fine. It also was received very fast. I was amazed how quickly I received it. One issue though; it has one of the most lacking owner's manuals, so be prepared for trial and error. I know a fridge is not the most complicated equipment, but I had to guess which way the cold adjustment knob was supposed to go to make the fridge colder. The knob is also down in the back, so if you have to adjust, it is a bit of a reach. Now that I figured things out, though, I really am pleased 
I happen to think that these saucers are the prettiest out of the entire line~ I originally got a couple as a gift and loved them so much decided to expand and make it a collection. I was hoping to find the teacups here too, but had to purchase them elsewhere 
These plates are nice and large. They are also very white and clean looking. A little on the heavy side though. Which makes them feel expensive. I ordered these plates in October and received them in a timely manner. I liked them and ordered a second set in November, which I still haven't received. Amazon has sent emails saying they are coming, but as of yet 1-9-07 they are still not here 
I'm a HUGE All-Clad fan and I thought that this would be the best splatter screen out there. I was VERY wrong. This lets so much grease through it's joke. Sure, it's not as bad as using nothing, but my entire stove is still covered with grease...and the design is very annoying, too. You can't store it up against the inside wall of a cabinet because of the handle design (which also is dangerous BTW - to lift it off a pan you have to grab it right over the pan - as opposed to a handle extending out - with grease splattering everywhere and steam and heat coming right out. Plus the handle gets EXTREMELY hot as a result of this design, as well as it's over the same heat as your food. PLEASE save yourself $$$ and cleaning time and find a screen with smaller holes 
If you're an All Clad chef, you know the quality. Accept no substitute for a splatter screen. I was tired of wiping up grease splatters all over my stovetop, around the dials, on the floor, etc... The cheap flat screens just don't stay on the pan. The edges of the All Clad Screen make it foolproof for staying in place. The handle design saves space in storage. One size fits everything up to 13 inches. The screen is a high quality design, not a window screen that gets punctured sooner or later. I can tell that this screen will never bend out of shape either. Yes, it was more expensive than the cheap flat ones, but you'll appreciate the performance and durability advantages 
I have been looking for one of these for years every where. Hardware,supermarkets and even walmart doesn't carry it. Call there porchasing agent and enlighten them that the item is availavle. I am 75. 
I recently ordered these spice tins -- 4 sets. What I received was 4 tins. When you look at this set and read the description, "12 pc s/s spice tins," you think you are getting a set of 4 tins per order, right? Wrong. I got one tin per order. Someone must have done a poor job describing this item, because it is not the set pictured nor described. The tins are nice, but they are a push on/off lid that I'm afraid will soon loosen. I wish they were screw on/off instead. The shipping was so costly that I kept them, but I am going to make some noise about this order. 
I got 2 of these and they are great. I use them as a night light, emergency light and a tent light when I'm camping. It works great keeping critters away from you camp. I put one in the tent as a light and put the other outside aimed at my cooler and food. If you have ever been raided by a bear/racoon/etc. you can appreciate this. It would be a great product at twice the price. Good company. I highly recommend it. 
I liked the energy saving LEDs and motion sensor. The only drawbacks are the size - it is a large light - covers the entire 2 socket outlet no matter if you plug it in the top or bottom socket. Also if you look at it straight on the light is very blinding since it uses a mirror to strengthen the LED lights. Another inconvenient thing is that the photocell to sense daylight to turn off the motion sensor light when it is bright outside is a bit weak - even when I can see clearly, it turns on - but the photocell does work when I turn on full overhead lights. There is a dusk to dawn mode but I would prefer for it to not turn on during the day when using the motion sensing option. Other than that, I love the energy savings 
Great product for places with no outlets. The range is average, so if you are going to use it to light a stairway ( like I did ), then you will need to get two. One for the top of the stairs and one for the bottom 
I was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight. It looked to be WalMart type quality. I would have been better off buying from Linens and Things 
Columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time I didn't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom. The color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender, they call it Plumberry. The weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well, that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it. When the washcloths are completely drenched, they do seem a little more heavy than most, although they have that "spa feel" to them and they retain heat very well, which makes them sort of comforting. I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel. The edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don't fall apart the first time you wash them. ~The Rebecca Review 
I have recently become a Fiestaware addict! I started with these cute little bowls, which I thought would be perfect for my three small children to use. For my two year old, it is the perfect size for cereal. We also use these little fruit bowls to serve, well, fruit at the dinner table. I also like using these bowls for quick candy or nuts dishes when guests arrive--they really are so veratile. They stack up nicely in the cupboard. And the Cinnabar color is unbelievably rich and pretty. I just ordered several new pieces in other colors too, and the Cinnabar coordinates wonderfully with the Plum, Cobalt, and Periwinkle. 
If anyone had suggested that I would spend that much money on a coffee maker, Iwould have laughed. Once you use this machine, it is no longer necessary to spend money for coffee at any of the national chains. It is quick, convenient, easy to operate, and makes an excellent cup of coffee. 
I researched all of the top espresso machines, including Rancilio, Gaggia, Nespresso, Expobar, and Jura Capresso. Most machines I eliminated because they had copper or brass boilers vs. safer stainless steel. I also wanted something easy to use and self cleaning. The Jura Capresso E8 makes perfect crema espresso with a push of a button, and the manual doser works great for decaf. I added the FrothExpress attachment which siphons milk from my stainless steel milk container and makes instand microfoam froth perfectly. According to the Jura Capresso rep I talked with, this machine has similar interior workings to their much more expensive machines (i.e. Z5), at a much lower cost. The black plastic housing looks great on the counter and seems durable. Not worth the extra money for the E9 and more metal. I am very particular when it comes to the flavor of espresso, and this machine makes espresso that rivals any that I have had at home or at a coffee store, in terms of flavor and temperature. This machine is one of the best home appliances I have ever purchased. I do not work for Jura Capresso. At $850 with no tax and free shipping through Amazon, it is a bargain 
This machine made the best coffee I have had in the States, the layer on top that is produced is reminiscent of the coffee I had in Italy. I would recommend this machine to any and everyone 
I share some bad experiences too. I bought the E8 on Amazon and used it for 3 weeks. It was working fine initially until I started using my Capresso beans, which were delivered to me just last week (made use of the Amazon rebate offer). The machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee. Instead, the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled. The machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on. I've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the Capresso customer service for assistance yesterday. There's no point calling the toll-free number since I'm never home during office hours to go through the process. This should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance. Other than that, I must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient. Although I do agree with Roell that it does look cheap 
The machine is superb! It makes consistently great tasting coffee each and every time. It sets up easily and turns on with a push of a button. We have our coffee within minutes just by pushing a button and placing our cup under the spout. We choose our selection of coffee strenght, amount 1 oz - 8 oz, 1 - 2 cups and drink up. It automatically shuts off and we determine when. I have not been able to produce a thick foam with the frother and thought it would be more powerful. But overall it's a great addition to our kitchen. 
I bought this for my wife who drinks about six cups every morning (finally got her to switch to mostly decaf). I first bought a less expensive (still @$400) machine which was not automated. Took it back when I realized that it was probably share space on the counter with our current coffee maker as using it involved additional tasks and with three kids we already have enough tasks. The Jura-Capresso works great - easy to use, easy to clean (really only the steam wand and that is simple to clean as the espresso or coffee fills the cup) and no extra work. It tells you when to empty the grounds (about every 10 cups), and fill the water and beans. It rinses the nozzle automatically when it shuts down (two hour auto shut down) and tells you to rinse it (by pushing a button) when you power it up. I cannot think of an easier way to have coffee, espresso, cappuccino or cafe au lait anytime we feel like it. I especially like the fact that we are not tied into using a company's pods (paying a premium and wasting a lot of paper) and can load any bean we desire or use the bypass to use ground coffee. Two wishes - a larger water tank (or ability to hook up to water supply) and allowing the angle of the steam wand to move higher as it can be a pain to put the wand into larger mugs. But those are just wishes - not gripes. Two months and no problems - just got the steamer container that came free but haven't tried it yet. A great buy!!! 
I was extremely diappointed in this simple can opener. It does not work. The gear and wheel will not cut smoothly and misses some spots. I've had to pry the lid of a partially opened can off several times 
This is a real disappointment from a name brand that has built it's reputation on quality. (How hard can it be to build a good can opener??) The blade gear that are supposed to hold the edge of the can, don't meet well. If you DO get it to cut, it requires tremendous hand strength and multiple stops and starts, leaving uncut gaps in the rim. The handle is loose, but can't be tightened. You can buy 4 cheap can openers for the same price, that will last you for years. 
It is hard to believe - but IT DOES NOT OPEN CANS. Seriously. Christmas morning with food preps well underway we discovered our brand new opener would not open cans. Unbeliveable! 
I had this opener and tried it with about a dozen cans and it lost its sharpness and now it was in the trash can. It's expensive for such a gadget and didn't work 
My entire kitchen is Kitchenaid. I bought this can opener three years ago. It was awful...difficult to use, shredded the paper at the top of the can's label, and was very difficult to get started. Because I love Kitchenaid products so much, I assumed that this was just a defective can opener, threw it away, and bought another. The second one was even worse! It worked okay the first couple of times, but now it barely cuts at all. It grinds the top of the can, making dents, but won't actually make a cut. Once I can get it started, I cannot finish it because it "messes up" the can pretty badly. This one is going in the garbage as well. : 
I cannot believe what an ergonomically ill-fitting and horribly working product this is. The best thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty. Some others are satisfied, so I can only surmise that there are vast differences in the quality of the products leaving the assembly line. Unfortunately, this brand-new can-opener is going in the trash. 
I bought one of these about 6 months ago and it worked beautifully. No problems. Moved out of state and accidentally left it behind, so I replaced it with another. Will not cut. At all. I don't get it. Was there a recent lemon run of these things? 
These are the same size as the Siliconezone fluted tart pan which I paid twice as much for. I thought these were minis and planned to bake cookies in them but they are BIG 
I have used these for making florentine cookies which are extremely sticky, having used disposable mini aluminum pans in the past. They work perfectly, releasing the florentines immediately. Just ordered two more pans, and the price went down, too 
It's Fiesta ware what's not to love! Couldn't find this one anywhere else 
This is a great idea! Everyone should have AT LEAST ONE of these ~ personally I'd get one for every member of the household. The well is perfect so theres no slipping or sliding and it can easily be carried without having to worry about it falling off. We love this. And this is a great color. So much prettier than the picture. 
One of the criteria in this family for what color to stock up on is how it looks under Mexican food. Sea mist and rose are two of the best, so we're building up our stock before they are discontinued at the end of the year. This set is a great way to prevent public double-dipping -- just have a lot of these in the pantry so everyone can double-dip guilt free 
Finally, a pan that makes it easy to bake! No more messing up the first piece of cheesecake or brownies, trying to get them out of the pan. The sides of this pan just pop off and leave you with access to cut from all sides. The non-stick finish cleans up in seconds. It bakes evenly, also. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to bake 
Cooks nicely, non-stick performs well, great new shape. Very satisfied customer! The cherry cheesecake recipe included is good, too. **Hint: use recipes for 10-in round pans to make full use of the pa 
My wife and I noticed the difference within a day of using it. We felt better in the morning. Neither of us has been sick this Winter after using it for several months. And I was amazed at how much dust was on the pre-filter when I replaced it for the first time. I'm so glad we bought it. Note: As with all HEPA filters it does make noise. I recommend buying a large one and running it on low when you're sleeping in the room. 
I keep this unit running throughout the day in my bedroom and shut it off at bedtime. (Too noisy for me). I'm actually sleeping better/less stuffy. I recommend this filter for anyone who has some difficulty breathing easy at night 
Pro: very good ratings from Consumer Reports Con: to read the reviews here, it's loud But it's not what I imagined. It's "loud" setting is about as loud as a bathroom fan, and it can easily be set to "low" at night to make it just white-noise. What matters: my wife didn't need her asthma inhaler after the first day, so I'm very happy with this 
I bought this to replace an old Honeywell Heppa air purifier. Since we were use to the white noise of the old one, we wanted one we could hear. If you put this one on the lowest setting it's just right noise wise.The 2nd and 3rd settings we find way too loud. It cleans the air well. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the light around the control is extremely bright. I had to paint around it to black it out and it still shines through some 
Good unit, helps my girlfriend who has allergies. Downside is that it has a bright blue light that lights the roon at night if it isnt covered with our socks, and its LOUD on high, semi-loud on low. The brain gets used to the noise though,bad if you watch alot of tv next to it 
I bought one of these to help my family's allergies and my asthma. It is great. I can tell a huge difference even in the amount of dust. I will say that the are a little noisy. My sister has the same one and hers doesn't seem to be as noisy but maybe it is just me. It is isn't enough for me not to use it though. I highly reccomend this product. Especially if you suffer from allergies the way I do. You will notice a big difference within just a day or two. I am even buying another to put in my bedroom 
the air purifier works well. the only problem is that it takes up a lot of space. it provides great white noise for sleeping 
I have purchased several Honeywell air cleaners recently for my family (children, parents and brother's household) and have been very pleased with their performance and and engineering. I was looking for an air cleaner for my daughter's room and was given an older model by friends who had used it briefly before buying an Ionic Breeze instead due to the noise level- the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars. While that machine is a Sears labelled appliance, it is identical to a small Honeywell. It has effectively reduced her symptoms, and the noise hasbn't been disagreeable on lower settings with any of the machines. Using the higher settings an hour or so before bedtime and reducing the fan speed to low during the night produces a 'white nboise" that I find soothing. Replacement filters (permanent) arte readily availabvle and economical (under $15.00 at Amazon). Other Honeywell air cleaners we have purchased differ in that they have no ionizer (not recommended by medical authorities- i am myself a family physician) and in their capacity. All of the machines I have bought are the round hassock-shaped ones and this is an imiportant design feature in that these models use either og two sizes of replacement permanent filters as above. Larger models may use up to three stacked filters in place of the original and expensive non-permanent filter. All use a cut-to charcoal-containing pre-filter which may be vacuumed periodically and used for substantially longer than the packaging indicated (at least 6 months). The HEPA filters may be vacuumed as well, a simple maintenance task. The filter that comes with a filter that is NOT permanent but is instead a "long-life" singlre filter with a recommended replacement interval of five years. It does not have a "permanent filter". one of the big pluses for these machines is the excellent 5-year warranty. No machine in this price range except a few Hunter models offer a 5-year warranty, and Hunter permanent filters are far more expensive and hard-to find. I have noted some complaints about warranty service in other reviews of Honeywell products, but nonetheless it is still a very good value. I ofund some of my machines in the local Goodwill for $10 or so- check it out!. On new machines, I really couldn't beat the Amazon deals substantially and ordered one of these and another odel for family. My brother was so impressed he went out and bought 2 other machines (regrettably, not Honeywell) for his fairly severe allergy problems. t wouldn't count on these machines to eliminate strong odors vcompletely but they do make a difference. I would add a final note about my experience with central air conditioner filters. A NMERV of 8-10 is sufficient to remove almost all common allergens. Higher filtration requires larger surface area to prevent excessive air obstruction. We bought a filter some time ago that we couldn't use for that very reason. The most economical is the Lysol brand filter available in Lowes stores. Removing bacteria from the air is unimportant- "air sdanitizer" are a waste of money. Airborne bacteria rarely survive long and DO NOT cause odors in and of themselves- they must be in a nutrient rich medium and actively growing to cause odors. As for mold, remember that removing moisture is the answer to that problem. A relative humidity of 40 % or less will take care of mold and mildew very nicely. So, use your AC, dehumidifier, or pipe wrench as needed to control moisture problems. As for vacuums, they all work- IF YOU USE THEM! A central system that exhausts to the outdoors or a garage area that can be aired is a great option. bagless vacuums, water trap vacuums, etc really don't make much difference in air quality. We find that using simple bedlinens in the children's rooms which can be tossed in the dryer for 10 minutes are useful ways to control dust mites and remove some of their allergens. Stuffed animal toys can also be given a spin for the same reasion. Sorry if I get carried away, but I have always felt a duty to teach my opatients to take care of themselves. I hope this has been helpful. The Honeywell air cleaners are a great way for allergy sufferers to take control of their symptoms in part. 
In an attempt to get RED coffee mugs, I ordered two "cinnibar" Fiestaware coffee mugs. While they are in the red family, the color has too much brown in it for me. I wish Fiestaware would produce a true red shade. Other than that,they were fine. Price reduction didn't mean much once the s were added. Could have driven to the store, paid regular price and still gotten them for less. My fault for being lazy 
If you've bought Fiestaware place settings in the past, you've surely noticed the awkward shape of the coffee mugs of yore. The old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably. While the art deco design is lovely, using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting "morning coffee" experience we've come to expect from no-nonsense diner mugs. Anyway, Fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle... and it's a realistic size, too, not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee. Yay for the Java Mug 
Definitely focuses the flavor and aroma of the finest Hermitage, shiraz , etc......but the the glasses do not feel as delicate, and refined as my other sommelier series do. Maybe because they are hand made? I compared the ones I bought on amazon to another set at a local store. The glasses at the store felt lighter . Otherwise, the glasses are excellent! Go figure? Oh, and there was a small bubble on one of the glasses. Not a distraction after filled with wine, but ..............$60.00 a glass !! 
This product is great to store cereal in! It keeps it food fresh and leaves very little mess when the children use it. It is great. i would recommend it to everyone 
I purchased this item to store cereal items for my four young children. This item is flimsy and cheaply made yet very costly. I would not recommend this item to customers who have younger children. It is not child-friendly. The only thing I do like about this item is that it color coordinate with the other appliances in my kitchen. 
I was a bit hesitant to give this a try, simply because I didn't see how spending $35 would be worth it when I could just have my cats' dry food bags be rolled and clipped for freshness for a lot cheaper. But I am so happy that I purchased this dual food dispenser. First, it is incredibly easy to put together, and arrived in perfect shape. It looks as though it might be unsturdy, but so far it has held its ground. The overall appearance is very attractive, and looks a helluva lot better than rolled up bags! In terms of its utility, this dispenser is terrific! I can keep almost a full bag of cat kibble in each dispenser, so getting the kitties ready for meals is simple. A few twists of the knob, and I have just the right portion. I also no longer have dry food pouring out of enlarged bag holes, causing unpleasant, crumbly messes when the pieces I missed when cleaning up are accidentally stepped on later. Overall, this is a great product. It's plastic, but looks very sleek, and the chrome handle is a very nice touch that coordinates well with my decor. Zevro offers a similar dispenser that is specified as a pet food dispenser, but I think they're pretty much all the same thing. I picked this one because I wanted the two different containers, plus I liked the color scheme better, and it has worked out quite well 
We purchased the Ceral Dispenser especially for our guests to serve themselves one of two types of ceral we offer in the mornings. It is a nice design and seems to work very well. The seal seems good enough to insure freshness 
I love this dispenser. It helps keep all of the clutter of cereal boxes off of my refrigerator and out of my cabinets. My 1 year old loves to turn the knob to get the cereal out 
This product seemed like a good idea. I mix my own cereal, and add lots of nuts and seeds. So it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures. The way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure, and when full of heavy cereal, disaster is assured. Also, neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal, so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me, and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor. I had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position. If you take it off first, then some cereal leaks out, causing the problem I was trying to solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests. I tried this product for awhile, but threw it in the trash pretty fast. Went back to a big tupperware container Not as convenient as this could have been, but no awful spills either 
Ordred Feb 25th, recieved a broken one soon after. I returned it right after and now its the middle of April and it is still not here. If you live in Wisconsin they are $15.99 at a pick n' save. I give up! I have bought several things from Amazon and still have yet to recieve them or find out shipping info. I have better things to do with my money. I will now shop somewhere else!!!! 
As a blender, this works really well. It has a lot of power and the stir stick helps knock out air bubbles and keeps things moving. The blades are well set so that I can wash it (carefully) without gloves and I've never cut myself. The lid is good and tight, although at high speeds the suction in the center works the lid right off. Once you've used it you know what blended food is, lesser blenders just mix food. The problem is the cheap aluminum metal covering below the blades in the canister peels off. How about ingesting little shards of aluminum with your food? I use mine every day but I wash it by hand with a soft sponge. I'm not rough on it, but that aluminum covering peeled and little bits found their way into my food. I realized it when I was drinking a smoothie, something hurt my tongue I and went to see where they came from. Supposedly the warranty should cover it, but I have to pay to ship it and I can't get L'Equip on the phone or by e-mail. It would actually be less expensive to just buy a new pitcher/blade assembly than bother with the warranty for it but they have been out of stock on that for months. I would not buy this again. It's too expensive to have had such a problem without a good solution. 
We LOVE this blender. I've never had a blender with power before, I guess, but this one will take a beet or a carrot and chop it up just like it's oatmeal or something. It makes awesome shakes and I use it to chop or puree lots of everything else as well 
I was so happy with my first L'equip that I bought another one to have at work! It's awesome! I have the Other high-speed blender but this one runs circles around it. I use the Other one to chop up food scraps for the compost pile 
These were a perfect fit for my older ionic pro. When I first got them they looked different but they still fit. I got my product faster then I thought I would and that's great service. Very pleased with everything 
Glade we bought them. We do not smoke but are living in an apartment where our neighbors do. Smoke no longer is noticable in our apartment. Even going one day w/o the machine you could smell smoke. Now we don't have to wait for the blades to dry but use the extra set 
I love these pieces. I plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai 
I have four 16-piece sets that I received for my wedding. They are beautiful plates, but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave, going through the dishwasher or serving hot food. Within 3 months, several plates cracked down the middle, making them unusable. A large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added. I did a search on www.epinions.com and found I wasn't the only person having these problems. EVERYONE is having these problems. Plus, it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces. You have to buy another set. What a racket. The clincher is that they are located in Indonesia, so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent. I've gotten nothing but the international run-around 
Despite the picture currently posted above (and I'll edit this should it ever change), the 5 piece completer set contains: A large round platter A serving or "vegetable" bowl Covered sugar bowl Creamer The platter looks exactly like the dinner plates but it is approximately 12" in diameter. The serving bowl is a perfect mid-size for most family meals; I used it more than any other serving bowl in my kitchen. Its shape is similar to the salad bowl, although it seems to sweep out more proportionately from the base. The sugar bowl has a pinch-grip top, and the creamer has a high, relatively narrow spout that doesn't drip. Like the rest of the Nova series, the look is sedate and handcrafted (although it is not), with a hint of Asian. I love the way this line looks, but those seeking out an elegant pattern would best look elsewhere. 
i am still trying to figure out how this fan and the other honeywell fan differ (other than this is 24.99 and the other is 39.99). mine has the exact features as the more expensive one even though this is described as a bargin unit. this has the individual fan controls, directional grills, thermostat.... i would advise since this product is 24.99 to purchase something else too so you can take advantage of the free shipping. i didnt really need anything else so i picked up a 1.99 cat toy and got the free shipping instead of forking out the 14 bucks shipping would have cost without the additional purchase 
I bought this item no more than two months ago. And the motor in the fan already broke. When it arrived the plastic casing was cracked. Well done Amazon 
Sadly I bought this item from a link in google that took me to Amazon and didn't list all the sources ON Amazon that sold it. I ended up paying $15 or so more than necessary for it, since Their price was more than Target's SHIPPED price. I bought it at Beach Audio, through Amazon for $33.07 with a shipping charge of $14.35, for a final price of $47.42. Had I realized I should have RE-searched on Amazon for the brand and model number I would have found it from Target at the $25 listed price and shipping under $7!!! A substantial savings. HOWEVER, sad as I am that I could have saved a few of my Social Security bucks, I'm totally amazed at the job this tiny fan is doing for me. Here's my situation, and though I'm sure yours is quite different, you can see the value of the appliance: I'm a retired person, living upstairs in a tiny living quarters with someone else living downstairs who is in control of the heating and cooling of the house. During the fall and spring when it's nice outside, the house heat is turned on and migrates upward to become trapped in my tiny living quarters. If I open a window, the heat goes out and the heating system comes back on to make more, I'm sure this causes their electric bill to skyrocket. I found that if I become uncomfortable, I can close my door and my air conditioning vent and crack a window for fresh air, allowing the heat transmitted through the floor to warm the room. This works pretty well, but sometimes not much air comes in the window... and occasional birds and insects to find their way in. The little Honeywell fit one of my windows perfectly and can be set to quietly blow air in and out at the same time, and it's thermostatically controlled so it can hold the room at exactly the temperature I like. If I want to smoke a cigar or my pipe, I can set it to exhaust through both fans, or to circulate in and out faster, so I don't have to worry about poluting the air throughout the house (be sure the door and a/c vent are closed before doing this, they WILL notice :). The fan blades are plastic, but well enough made so the low setting is not objectionable at all. I had tried a 20" box fan to exhaust air before, but that was extremely noisy even at the lowest setting. The low setting on this one makes no more noise than my computer fan and still moves air so well I immediately feel the fresh air. I paid too much for it, but it's worth twice the price to me. I'm a happy old man and very pleased with my purchase. I hope it lasts a long time 
I bought this fan to replace one that was broken during moving. This is the second one we have purchased and it is a great product. The ability to vent air with the flick of a switch is very useful, the thermostat works quite well and the twin fans have a good amount of circulation power for a fan this size. I would recommend this fan to anyone 
This is a kitchen item I wouldn't want to be without, it gets constant use. Never used a cooking device that I could brown, steam and cook in such a short time with better results than a slow cooker, microwave or the oven. From Asparagus to Pot Roasts and Soups it never fails. Best purchase I've made in years. The real plus about it is the removable non-stick liner, makes cleanup a snap 
I've been using this pressure cooker for the past 3 years. It is by far the best appliance in the kitchen. I use it to cook chicken and pork stock broth. I store the broth frozen in empty milk plastic containers. This way I always have some available for soup or various usage. In fact, since content of the pressure cooker is essentially sterile (as in canning), I've been able to store the content for up to 2 days if I don't open the lid. It can probably last longer but I've never tried it. YOU WONT REGRET BUYING THIS ONE 
The pressure cooker works really well. The most notable advantages are very quite and big internal space. As suggested by other reviewers, the thermal fuse is a problem. The power off problem also occurred in my cooker. But, you can buy a replacement thermal fuse from RadioShack for $1.49. It took me about 40 minutes to replace the fuse. The fuse is located at the bottom of the cooker. Replacement is not a big job if you know who to do it 
I just now read the reviews of other customers and I agree with everyone who rated this appliance with just one star (which it doesn't even deserve). I can see how if this thing even worked that it would be great, but unfortunately I canNOT recommend this to anyone. Now I am stuck trying to get my money back. My first one (which I got for christmas) also just stopped working (probably overheated and blew a fuse) plugged it in and NOTHING after about the 4th use. So I went through the whole riga-ma-role of sending it back to the manufacturer (Salton) They sent me back another (shipping paid) Nice I thought, but as soon as I opened it I understood that this was not a brand new model. With the very first use it was already a NO-GO! The lid was defective... not able to close properly and steam was escaping. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!!! 
Owned this unit for 8 months. I use it about 5 times a week and I think its the best kitchen gadget ever. However last month it stopped working and I was not happy because I needed it for a dinner party the next day. So in desperation I took it apart and in the bottom of the unit in a plastic box the one that has two spring loaded buttons you will find a fuse like device called a (tco) or thermal cut off. It looks like a diode in a plastic tube. They're installed on alot of appliances that have heating elements like coffee brewers. The (tco) used is rated at 128 degrees fahrenheit. I happen to have the exact (tco) from a Bissle carpet scrubber. Replaced the (tco) with that one and viola I'm back in business. I would not recommend this fix for those who aren't mechanically inclined. 
This product exceeded expectations and has expanded our menu due to ease of operation and cleanup. Cannot go wrong on this one 
This is a great pressure cooker. Only drawbacks, and they're minor, are that it's a little heavy and you have to hold down a button for quick steam release. Other than that, I have no complaints. It's the most used appliance in my kitchen 
I love this pressure cooker. I have tried two others and hated them. The feature that is the best is the digital readout. No more guessing about the pressure. I would highly recommend this to all my friends 
First of all, this thing is huge! Make shure you have the space... All of the features work as advertised, the browning feature works much better than we thought it would, just like a skillet... Quiet compared to a stovetop unit and much safer... Build quality is excellent , easy to clean, just what we wanted.. 
Recieved the cooker VERY promptly, LOVED it, but it quit working after 1 week. This was definitely not the sellers fault and I was refunded the cost quite promptly. The cooker while it worked was absolutely awesome 
Although the lights are very pretty, the information in the box states that the lights are to be used on a short term basis (no more then 90 days) and to be put indoors or dry outdoors. When I was searching for lights I depended on the information given to me in the description. Nowhere, that I saw when I ordered the lights, did it specify those instructions. I bought lights that I cannot use 
I often heard about the benefits of using Reidel crystal to enhance the flavor and bouquet of wine, but never tried it until I bought this set. And it is true--I chose a nice bottle of petit syrah wine, but it was even better than usual in the Reidal stemware. Be prepared--it is a really big piece of stemware 
The Riedel Vinum series of stemware is very good, and the syrah/Rhone glass is no exception. The size and shape of the bowl really do enhance the bouquets of Chateauneuf de Pape, Cornas, Gigondas, and other southern and northern Rhone wines, as well as Australian or Californian shiraz/syrah based wines. (I've also found it to be quite good for brunellos, and some sangiovese-grosso based super-Tuscans. The only drawback is having to buy six, which may be more than some people need. If you do a little searching on the web, you'll find that these glasses are available singly from some retailers. However, that said, this is not a bad glass for everyday use, if you prefer to have just one glass for red wine; I'd probably choose the Spiegelau vino grande magnum bordeaux glass for that purpose, but each to his own 
We currently live in France, a country where wine is etched into the national consciousness. We invited some French friends over to compare Australian and French wines of the same grape varieties (chardonnay, cabernet, merlot), but didn't have enough Riedel glasses to go around. Some of us were consistently rating wines lower - and then we realised that they had the non-Riedel glasses. A quick tour of the table with the same wine in the two types of glass convinced everybody of the merits of this glassware. A TIP ON WASHING: one pain is the need to hand-wash these glasses. A sommelier gave us the tip that to avoid breaking Riedels while washing, do not hold the stem to turn the glass while cleaning it. Hold the whole bowl with one hand, while using a wash cloth with the other 
I attended Tulsa Chef Fest 2002 in November and attended a Riedel conducted seminar sampling a series of wines from around the world. I was skeptical but after the seminar I am rabid convert preaching the word. The effect of these glasses on wine is simply amazing. In the subsequent couple of weeks my wife and I purchased several of the Vinum series - "Bordeaux", "Chablis" (Chardonnay), "Sauvignon Blanc" and "Syrah". We will be adding more in time. The Syrah glasses are particular effective at concentrating the nose of the Australian and South African wines we have already enjoyed. Your satisfaction is guaranteed and the price, even at full retail, is worth every penny for the years you will enjoy with this superb glassware 
There aren't any wine glasses out there that I prefer over the Riedel Vinum series (except the Sommelier of course). I do have one observation though, and this is why I didn't give this glass a 5 star rating: the Vinums that I've purchased in the past 5 months don't seem to be up to the same quality standards of the Vinums I purchased a year ago. The older Vinum, which has the logo etched in the base, has a better/cleaner cut rim and the bowl seems to be thinner - making the entire glass look, feel and sound more elegant. The new Vinum, which has the logo and riedel name etched in the base, has a lip which looks slightly rounded in a side-by-side comparison with the older glass and the bowl/glass itself seems thicker. Maybe Riedel made some changes to improve durability, but I like my old Riedels better. All in all, as I said at the beginning of this review, there is nothing better out there than the Riedel Vinum series (as long as you don't pay full retail)... 
I received the Riedel Syrah glasses as a gift after lusting after them for ages. I now wish I'd just bought them for myself. My husband and I did a side-by-side tasting of a yummy Rhone in our regular glasses and in the Riedels. No comparison, the Riedels are great. Plus, they're beautiful 
I have a kitchen full of gadgets and most my wife just rolls her eyes about but the first time she used this she couldn't say enough about it. Now a year later she still says how much she prefers it over our other pastry cutters (which have all been thrown out... 
The name fits, this is the Best Pastry Blender. It's like a small potato masher, with the strength that suggests. We had two previous pastry blenders that tended to bend and twist. One use of this little brute and the others went to Goodwill, and good riddance 
This is a well-made, mid-sized pot rack. The half-round shape is very adaptable. Compares favorably with racks sold by Williams Sonoma for more than $150.00. One of our best Amazon purchases ever 
I was very please not only with the product once I received it, but the speedy amount of time it took from the time I ordered it until I received it. It is extremely sturdy, and looks exactly as it did on the internet. I am VERY happy with my purchase, and will probably order again from this website: 
This has to be the most beautiful paper towel holder that I have ever seen 
This item was shipped quickly and arrived sooner then promised. It is a beautiful piece and I get compliments from everyone. Thanks 
What a wonderful way to have paper towels in a kitchen! Arthur Court items are so beautiful and look so much like fine pewter.So many people wonder where in the world I found a pewter paper towel holder. And it is a perfect design in actually helping to pull off paper towels,according to my engineer/scientist husband. Do not hesitate on this one 
I have the other tri ply cookware, but wanted a non-stick version pan that was in the tri ply line. I love it! Go with the 12 inch if you are only going to get one non-stick pan as it will cover all your needs. Easy to clean and I love that it matches the tri-ply stainless pans I have- so they can all hang from the pot rack 
This skillet is wonderful. Very well balanced, even heating and extremely easy to clean. I love it and will buy the 10" at a later date 
I tried the regular Calphalon tri-ply stainless steel saute pan and took it back. Too much work to clean and it was very heavy. Then I bought the nonstick tri-ply stainless steel omelet pan. It provided quick even cooking and is very easy to clean. Cheese sauces and eggs just glide off onto the plate and whatever residue is left is a breeze to clean. Also it is not as heavy as regular Calphalon pans. Furthermore, the handle does not get hot. I am now looking for more pieces. My old pots and pans were wedding presents from 39 years ago 
Even when I bought the Fiestawere Cinnabar creamer I loved it right away, but to order the Cinnabar Covered Suger Bowl from a nother seller and have them match so well. I am so happy that my sugar bowl is such a perfect match. Thank 
This sleeping bag is perfect for younger kids. It's certainly not made for heavy outdoor use (it's pretty lightweight) but is perfect for "slumber parties" in my kids' rooms. My only concern is the straps that keep it rolled up while not in use. If the bag is unrolled and you want to keep the straps from tripping someone, etc. you can loop them back and close them with a velcro tab, creating a choking hazard. If you don't reattach them, the velcro can attach itself to the bag itself and interfere with the zipper 
This blender has been emitting a motor-burning smell since the day I got it. I thought it would go away, but it has only gotten worse. Definitely does not do what it says it does, all speeds perform the same. What a waste of money! 
I received this blender as a Chirstmas gift. I use it several times each week to blend bananas and milk, that's it. It is now mid-March and the motor has already burned up. It started with a burning smell and then progressed to bright welding-type light (from the motor sparking) being emitted from the back of the blender. I am quite disappointed and have since bought a new more reliable blender 
This blender is simply just powerful good looking blender that is so simple I bet even George W. Bush can use it (no offense to Republicans, I am one of you anyway). This thing can blend or crush or chop, or anything (depending on the settings) to your will from frozen cranberries to sticky gummy bears (don't ask). And no matter how many foodstuffs you mix in of different types or in different stages of matter it can throughly blend them to make smooth combo drinks or throughly spread flavored salsa or just knock out the lumps in pudding or gravy to the point that it would cause a French chief to weep with jealousy. I'm a person who hates cleaning to be honest but simply this blender is just easy to clean despite what type of mess I make in the blending jar or button counter from sticky milkshake to greasy gravy. I'm a person who when I buy something I don't read the instructions, I just try to get a feel on how to use it and simply all of this blender's vast settings are self-explanatory with no instructions needed, so I got the feel of it in no-time 
Works well, as expected. This is a replacement for the same pan model that served us for over 10 years. We expect the same from this one 
I love the two pans I bought. They are exactly what I need to make Swedish pancakes 2 at a time. They are also the perfect size for omelettes 
I use this item as additional pantry space. The kitchen in my new apartment is small, and didn't have enough space to store everything. I hung this storage rack over the back of a closet door, and use it for boxes of dry goods and some canned foods as well. It holds quite a bit for its size, and is very sturdy. My one caution: if you're going to hang this over the door, use the included screws and clips to mount it to the door. If you don't, when you open/close the door, it rattles around a lot. 
This gadget is wonderful for frothing up low fat milk in the cup before adding your coffee. It gives a lasting froth that adds to the pleasure of your drink. There are other frothers around that have a coiled circle at the bottom, but these don't do as good a job. The battries last a long time and the motor is strong enough for at least 2 years of daily use 
Okay, sorry about the alliteration. Powered by four AA batteries, this little speedster works really, really well, turning a half-cup of milk into a cup of rich, foamy goodness in about 15 seconds. The stand is sturdy and balanced and keeps the little guy within easy reach of your espresso machine. I knocked off one star because I wish the power button atop the handle was an on/off rather than a press-and-hold job (a minor quibble, to be sure) 
With all the great revues on this frother, I thought I couldn't go wrong buying one. Not so though!! After following instructions in detail, the frother I received keeps getting stuck in the 'on' position and also seems to have 2 speeds. Also, just to prove a point more to myself, I frequently have to take the top/cap off and press the button to get it to go fast (I don't actually use it to froth this way) ... or use 2 hands to hold it and press the button which is very awkward and then even that doesn't help sometimes. The bottom line is that it will very seldom operate at it's normal speed or it gets stuck on!! Clearly this frother isn't working the way it should and is somehow getting stuck or the button doesn't go down enough. I was going to keep it anyway, but decided to return it as I seem to have no control over wheather it wants to go fast or slow. I really like that it has it's own stand, so I'm very dissappointed that I can't get it to work properly. This is a real shame as I was prepared to love this little frothing machine 
This is the second frother I've bought and it really has some power to it. Nice and compact. Gives a great quick froth, esp. for the price. Also works well on blending single servings of salad dressing. Just don't get the battery part wet. 
This is an excellent battery powered mixer for items like chocolate milk,protein drinks, cocoa, high fiber drinks,frothing milk for coffee,powdered drinks, and other small mixing jobs. 
This compact unit is comfortable in the hand, attractive on the counter, and works incredibly! Froths even whole milk so fast. Better than more expensive and bulkier units in performance. Yeah 
I bought one a few years ago got hooked--can't drink my morning coffee without frothy milk! It finally broke so I went online to replace it. I've seen other types, but this style is the one I had to have! Found it (new) at Amazon.com for the same price I paid 3-4 years ago. It came in a few days and works beautifully. I'm a happy camper again 
This is a great way to cut back on Starbucks trips. But the blade at the end of the wand was very loose after a few uses. I have to be sure it is tight before each use. But it works well 
This pan is a great value. Sure, it's a little small, but you can see that when you order (it's only 7 1/2", not 12", after all). I've had two of these pans for four years now, and they're wonderful. Buy these, and buy the 12" one too. You won't be sorry 
I only have one All-Clad pan (I'd like to have more). I love this little pan. I use it all the time for cooking different things: a hamburger, some linguicia (portuguese sausage), and eggs. I use some canola oil in it for something that might stick (such as an egg). I have NO problem cleaning it at all! As soon as I am done frying something, I put some water in the pan. Whatever might be stuck to it comes right off...even better than with a non-stick surface. Having used 'cheap' pans my whole life, it was amazing the difference it makes using a pan that works the way it should. It makes cooking fun! Love my little pan 
This is the best saute pan I have ever used. It provides perfectly even heating and is very easy to clean 
I have to say that I am very happy with my All-Clad Ltd pieces, including this little fry pan. Because of the price, I picked up this one and the 1 qt. sauce pan to give them a try. My family used to cook with the all ss line so I knew that these would be quality and I was not let down. Yes, stainless is more difficult to cook with, but have you tried hard anodised pots? impossible. That's why my equally beautiful (IMO) Calphalon professional pots are looking great as kitchen decorations and not much else. Your food will only burn if you are not paying attention to it. If you are having this problem, try non-stick, so you can go do whatever else it is you want to do other than paying attention to your food. If you are looking for top quality cookware that is oven safe, lasts a lifetime, and demands a little more care from the chef......this is it 
We bought 20 of these li'l darlins for the saute' line at work and procceded to attempt their destruction and rapid demise...to no avail. They do a great job on our 500 degree flat top and over our ring burners as well. We cook quickly and efficiently so perhaps our style helps us avoid the previously mentioned problems...(for omlettes/frittatas we do use the 8 non stick version). Crepes...no problem. The adonized finish has held up well after 6 months and hundreds of trips through our commercial dishmachine...don't try that at home...it voids the warranty.  We like 'em!!!  caveat...the stainless or MC2 line would have better suited our needs in the potsink as these don't like to be scrubbed with steel scrubbies...hence 4 mojo*z instead of 
I've tried all types of pans, including Calphalon, and All-Clad has them all beat. Nothing cooks more evenly, and food doesn't stick to the pan as much as it does to Calphalon pans. Consumer Reports also rates the All-Clad frying pan as the best on the market, ahead of other famous brands. Besides this one, I have 7 other All-Clad pans and they're all fabulous. I wouldn't cook on anything else 
The best thing I ever did was buy this pan. Because it was a cheap lesson to learn and I returned my larger set before opening the box. This is terrible cookware. I have this pan and the wok and tried cooking on it for nearly a year but am now so frustrated that I'm giving it up. I understand how to cook on stainless but still, who needs this aggravation of burning food and not being able to clean the pans!!!! You can not cook an egg on this pan, it's a kitchen disaster! Save your money, test with this pan first 
I thought this looked like a nice pan - so I thought I would give it a try. WOW - It cooks and cleans up like a dream. I ordered another one for myself - and one for my friend 
I'm sure there are cutlery snobs out there who would turn up their nose at anything that you can find in the local "Bedding Bathing Further" type store... but this thing is wicked. It's a huge, HUGE step up from the generic Chefmate set I got a while back. I cut a tomato in half quite literally on accident, while the old knife would take enough pressure to deform the poor little fruit or some sort of sawing. Think of this as an introduction to proper knives if you must, but I can't see a reason to get anything else... unless it's the 10" version! Incidentally, I chose this over Wusthof, Henkel, etc because the handle fit my hand the best and I like the "Japanese style" blade with no bolster. I'd recommend going to a brick to get a feel for the options before buying 
Using this knife has turned me into a snob. I have cooked at a few other people's houses since getting my Shun and with their knives it feels like I'm trying to saw through something with my finger. You can't explain how sharp this thing is. A friend of mine concurred and said she too is now annoyed when using a "regular" knife. A few weeks after getting the 8-incher I bought the paring one. With just these two I can do about everything I need a sharp knife for. 
This is my fourth Shun knife and it looks like I'm going for the complete set. Me, and the rest of my crew! You see, I work as a sous chef in a busy restaurant and over the years have amassed two (yes 2!) complete sets of german knives, great knives themselves. But when my exec. chef recently threw over his beloved forschner knives for these shuns, I had to found out why. So I bought my first one, a 7 in. santoku. It instantly became my favorite! I used it for the bulk of my chopping and dicing (and I do alot of that). The d-shaped handles are fabulous; they give you a good grip, comfortable for the long haul and slip-resistant when your fingers are wet or oily. My only complaint about the santoku is that it doesn't seem to keep it's sharp edge as long; it's a little thicker than the other blades and it takes more "steel" time to get it back to razor sharp. Pretty well impressed, I moved on to the big work horse - the 10 in. chef. Ok, it's now my favorite. It handles the bigger slicing jobs with such ease, it's a dream to use. And it was this knife that sold my crew on shuns. Now three out of five of them have at least one shun knife - the 8 in. chef - and looking to buy more. I still use my german knives; they continue to have their place in a restaurant kitchen with all the varied prep tasks that I have to do. But I find that the shuns come out more often than any other. And as we all stand around the prep tables furiously working, every one of us has a shun in our hand. These knives are definitely worth the investment 
My Favorite is the 10-inch model! This Shun knife (like all the others) is a terrific high quality blade. They are perfect! I hate to use the term "Balanced" in a knife review but it really feels great in the hand. The "D shaped grip" feels nice, and the knife really holds an edge 
I purchased this fine piece of cutlerly on some gift money last christmas. Little did I know how good of a purchase this thing was going to be. When I got it home, I instantly noticed the weight of the instrument and how well balanced it is between the handle and blade. I fell in love with it during the first meal I used it to prepare: veggies, meat, even poultry were easy fare. Only downsides I've had: sometimes a little big for delicate or finesse tasks, but that's why god invented the utility and paring knives. Also, I have a horrible fear of dropping this heavy, sharp object on my feet in the kitchen! (I've made it a personal point to always wear a sturdy pair of shoes while using this knife in particular.) Overall, this knife is worth every penny 
I got this knife for my wife who is a Chef. She says it is the best present I have ever given her. The weight and balance are perfect, and the edge is amazing. She just placed the edge of the knife on a piece of paper and suddenly we had two pieces of paper. The knife is also visually impressive. She does a lot of cooking and now wants a whole set of these knifes. At least I know what to get for her next birthday. We hoped that the knife would come with some 'how to care for' type instructions, but it does not 
I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase, then I went to a Williams Sonoma and handled the knife before making a final decision. Many have recommended that you handle the knives before purchasing... I also recommend this. Holding the knife in my hand is what locked the sale for me! I own a set of Trident (Wusthof) Grand Prix kninves, and wonderful knives they are. As I've been trying to teach myself better knife skills, I've been working at forming the proper hold (what chefs call the "pinch" hold). With the Wusthoff, I have to concentrate on it, because the knife never fit in my hand perfectly. The Shun is amazing in this regard. I will also say that I do have small hands... that seems to make a difference in whether many will like the Shun or not, but it definitely felt natural in my hand. I handled the Global alongside the Shun and put it down immediately (don't like the grip at all!). I've only been using the Shun for two days, but have already started thinking about a couple more additions to the ol' knife block. Is it sharp? Absolutely, everything cut like warm butter. Is that design, or the fact that it's brand new? I'll know in a few weeks! Again, before you purchase, handle the knife in a store, or a freinds kitchen or something. The way a knife feels in your hand should be the major decider 
I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives. I finally stepped up and got excellent knives. For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world. Check them out on the Web at kershawknives.com. Great features of the entire line include these cool "D" shaped handles that fit your hand better. Each knife is made in a right- and left-handed version (chefsresource.com for lefties). The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives. The knives are EXTREMELY sharp. One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives. The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle. I have small hands and this knife felt perfect. The weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand. This knife makes quick work of everything because it is so sharp. It is also much lighter than my previous knife, so I feel like I'm using a lot less force to slice and chop. I have the 7" santoku as well, but this is the knife that I will use for the majority of the prep. This is an expensive, but lifetime investment. I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website. For ratings on various brands and types of knives, check out cooksillustrated.coms' equipment ratings. This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of. 
I picked this blade up the other day and am thrilled with it. Though it was moe expensive than the Wustof that I had intended to buy I don't regret it. Lighter, sharper edge, and...wait for it...a left handed handle!!!! All you right handers out there wouldn't understand the novelty of actually having a kitchen gadget/utensil that we can use properly with OUR dominant hand. Pretty hard to find actually. Definitely cuts down on accidents and messes while cooking. According to the clerk that i talked to (very knowledgable) Shun only standardly makes the 8" shef knife and the paring knife for us lefties. The others can be special ordered and the place I went to has no up-charge for that, but if there's a sale the discount isn't as much, probably to cover the upcharge that the store is charge for the order. Don't think I can advertise for them but if you're in Seattle go to the water side of Westlake and turn left down 4th 
No more messy fingers. This is the most awesome tool for peanut butter, Mayo, and even butter. Love it! Also great for scraping out bowls. 
This is the best vacuum on the market for removing cat hair from your furniture and bedspread. It is far above using a pet hair remover (tape). It is great for the quick cleanups of tracked litter as well. I love it. 
I'm an engineer and I cannot believe that any company would, in good conscience, fob off such trash onto the consuming public. The reasons for the faulty performance are all based on fatally flawed design. A product with this many problems does not reach the market by accident. They had to have known it was junk, but chose to sell it anyway. Dirt Devil deserves the strongest form of rebuke and condemnation 
The Dirt Devil M08245 Power Reach sounded just great in the advertisements, but has turned out to be a major disappointment. While the product is easy to clean of dust and debris, the roller assembly if worthless. The brush stops in contact with any surface and does not perform at all. Even very light pressure from your fingers will stop the revolving brush. You are simply left with a suction hand vac without the benefit of a brush. I am sorry I bought this product 
I used this model twice and promptly returned it. The "turbo-driven" brush works only by the suction of the vacuum; it has no additional motor. This means that if the suction is ever less than perfect, the brush stops turning and is useless. Actually it's worse than useless because the non-turning brush then blocks the airflow and hampers suction. So I would not recommend this model 
The old Dirt Devils that I used to own were awesome - they would last forever even when taking lots of abuse. So I bought this updated one with high hopes. What a mistake! The biggest problem is that the agitator brush is air-powered, rather than electric or belt powered. Consequently, the brush stops turning whenever it hits anything soft (high carpet, plush upholstery) and is even less likely to turn if the filter is clogged up from cleaning. Time to find a new hand-vac manufacturer.. 
If there were a rating lower than 1 star, I would have used it, because this vacuum doesn't even deserve 1 star. In a moment of madness, I recently gave my old Dirt Devil to my daughter and bought myself the so-called "new and improved" model as a replacement. Big mistake. My old Dirt Devil was a workhorse and was used to spot clean the upholstery and floors in our RV, truck and car, and home, along with cleaning lots of other things such as draperies, pet beds, etc. I used it daily for 15 years and never, ever had a problem with it. This new bagless Dirt Devil has never worked right. Immediately, the revolving brush quit revolving. I returned the vacuum for a new one; the revolving brush never did revolve on it, even right out of the box. The vacuum loses suction within a minute or two because of the useless filter system. The Dirt Devil company won't take the unit back, and apparently they can't fix the brush problem, either, based on what I heard from appliance repair centers I contacted for service. I've already told my daughter that I want my old Dirt Devil back, but she loves it so much that I may have to bribe her to get it out of her hands. (I told her I'd give her my new one, but she's witnessed the problems I've had and the ineffectiveness of the model, and she said "No deal.") Save your money--this is a totally useless Dirt Devil model. The brush doesn't turn and there's no suction to do your cleaning. If you want to throw away your money, just throw it my way instead of wasting it on this thing. 
I bought the Dirt Devil Power Reach because it was advertised as having such versatile features along with a 6 amp motor. It was the worst vac I ever used! I purchased it specifically for vacuuming stairs and my car. The suction on the tools and hose attachments was great when I used it in my car. It worked well in all the crevices where dirt hides. However, when I switched to the revolving brush to clean the floor mats, it was useless. I guess I thought the revolving brush should actually revolve when in contact with carpet, but this isn't the case. Next I tried it on my carpeted stairs with the same disappointing results. The revolving brush stopped turning once it touched the carpet. The removable head is an interesting idea, however, the hose was too short to make this feature effective. I ended up dragging the whole unit around. I don't mind a bagless vacuum, but the dirt cup on this unit was clumsy to get on and off without spilling and the filter did not shake off easily. Needless to say, I returned it after one use 
I'm quite pleased with the performance of my Power Reach, perhaps because I'm using it strictly on smooth upholstery, to pick up small messes and to vacuum crud out of crevices (it would never have occurred to me to use a handheld - as many of the dissatisfied reviewers seem to have done - for anything more extensive). I like its design: with the detaching hose and head, and the crevice tool stowed in the case. It could be improved by being slightly more powerful, and by having a brush that is engaged by belt or gears; for what I paid, though, I think I got a good deal. My only complaint: it is the loudest vacuum I've ever run across - wear your earplugs with this one! 
i have this fan in my stereo cabinet so it will keep my xbox and equip. cool. on its lowest setting it does that. not really on the noisy side, the whir of the motor is only matched by the sound of the wind comming out of the thing. so far no problems, and is a steal for the price 
I wanted a fan for my desk at the office and it had to be relatively quite. I found it in this item. It doesn't take up much space and does the job. I love it 
We have this in our bedroom and it is awesome. Ours is dead quiet, one of the reasons we love it, and puts out a great amount of air for such a small fan. We also love the timer as it allows us to get the room cool for us to go to sleep and then turns itself off so we don't freeze or jack up the elecric bill. We also have it's big brother the 40" tower in our living room, again it's so quiet we forget it's even on except for the nice cool breeze. Definately A+ 
This fan would be terrific if it were quite. Once it starts to get a rattle it's so obnoxious that it's worthless. 
I have had this chair for 6 months now and I am dissatisfied. The screws were stripped for the legs and after just a little use its rickety and shifts a lot. I cannot keep one of the screws in the leg and that leg falls off shortly after the screw falls out. This is tras 
After looking at local stores and at more expensive brands on line, we decided to take a chance on these. I am glad we did. They are very nice and good quality. My kids love them. We are planning to order another set soon 
I purchased these barstools about a year ago. They were quite simple to assemble (I'm not the best at assembling things). Once put together, they were very sturdy. The seat itself is quite comfy, although the back of the seat does not provide the support that it boasts. Overall, this is a nice set of barstools and can really add a bit of flair and style to a bar or counter 
Beautiful bowls. Cobalt blue on the outside, french white on the inside. These bowls are very heavy, a sign of durability. These bowls are going to last a long time and I plan on ordering more 
First perspective that got the 4 rating: Love the bowls. Feel a bit ripped by the price. Over $20 a bowl is a lot to pay, but for cereal and icecream, these bowls are great. Don't buy enough for a large meal or table setting. These are for you and your favorite book in bed on Saturday morning. Deep bowls but not too large. Perfect for cereal and milk. Can't change the score but adding commentary - bowls do not wear as well as I would like. The insides get scratched up and do not look as good. Plus, you cannot microwave them. I would not recommend versus cheaper bowls at Crate and Barrel that I bought later 
THESE BOWLS ARE GORGEOUS, VERY STURDY,A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO ANYONES KITCHEN 
I find that I use these almost daily. They basically have become my new prep bowls.........for small amounts. Nice quality, easy stacking, even great color. Will probably buy a second set. 
My Grandson purchased the set of bowls for me ,something I keep on the counter at all times just so handy to have for all of my cooking.Have some pieces of Mario Cookware too which I just love. 
I love this set. I held off for a long time since I thought them a bit pricy. THEY ARE WORTH EVERY CENT! I leave them on the counter and use them everyday. I am doing the Weight Watchers point diet and these are great! I measure and often just eat out of them too. The fact each cup has two measures is wonderful. I plan to get some as gifts for friends who also follow a diet. Even if you don't diet they are super measureing cups. Very Heavy duty. You will not regret getting these 
makes preparing meals neater and easier, a must have in the kitche 
Even though the sizes are listed I missed that and from the picture thought they were bigger. After I got over the initial disappointment in size I realized they were really great to have for prep. I am going back to school to be a chef and am really trying to practice Mise En Place in my own kitchen (I think that is how you spell it, I better learn before my final). This set is great for the prep because it has two measuring amounts in one (like 3/4 cup and 1.5 in the same cup), which I came to realize has helped. I bought these and the OXO 4-piece prep bowl set with lids assuming I would try both and give one away, I ended up keeping and using both 
If you believe in preping ingredients before you cook, as I do, these bowls are extremely handy, particularly as they each have a line inside that indicates 1/2 the bowl's measure; e.g. 1 1/2 cup bowl has a 3/4 cup line, etc. This effectively doubles their use. They seem very rugged and easy to clean as well 
I love my bowl set but a little disappointed that there was no 1/3, 2/3 cup in the measurements 
I love, love my set! You have fun colors to choose from and they don't disappoint in person! There is a half way measuring line in each bowl to make it really nifty! When I first got them, I dropped the whole set from counter height. I was worried about cracking the plastic bowls. And was happy to find all were in perfect shape regardless of my little mishap! So, they are durable, stylish and extremely useful! I say buy a set, you won't be disappointed 
Every kitchen should have a set of these measuring bowls. I gave them to all my family for gifts and they love them, too. Great for measuring shortening, peanut butter, etc. because its easy to scrape out the bowl. Also good for nuts, raisens and coconut. I'm so glad I found them in the specialty shop. When no stores in our entire area carried them, I was very happy to find them on Amazon.com. 
I purchased this item for myself and when my husband saw it he wanted a set for his cook on the boat. I use it everynight when cooking. Good job Mario!!!!!!!!! 
I love my new salad bowl set. The color is beautiful, so is the quality and you can't beat the price 
Very lovely! It will accompanying any table service nicely! Amazon did well in getting the set to me in a very timely manner. Completely happy with the purchase 
I get a lot of compliments on this cherry salad bowl set. The bowls have an attractive, smooth texture and are the perfect size for not only side salads but cereal, soup, and snacks because they're deep. I always use the serving bowl when I make a family-size batch of french fries, and it also makes a terrific popcorn bowl. I suggest hand-washing because some of the finish peels off if you leave water in the bowls for an extended period of time 
I love the reidel line of wine glasses, both stemless and with stems. They are delicate though so not for the clumsy (although maybe stemless is better for the klutz since it has less opportunity to fall over). They make great gifts 
The Riedel "O" concept glasses may take a short while to accept, but once one realizes that a quality wine glass does not require a stem the rewards are many. The "O" glass line of products have made legendary glass maker Riedel's products affordable for the masses, while injecting an element of practicality for daily use. As a current owner of both traditional higher- priced Riedel stemware and these newer products, I find our "O" glasses are getting much higher use. They truly do enhance the flavors of good quality wines, while helping the wine drinker collect multiple glass ware designs at reasonable prices. I now have five different "O" styles on the shelf, yet these wide mouth Chardonnay glasses seem to get the biggest workout: they somehow do have the capability of bringing out the nuances of a wine, even for us less sophisticated buyers. Plus, my wife loves popping them in the dishwasher! 
Riedel glasses are great way to give a GREAT gift! Opens the wine wonerful, and I love the feel of the glass too. It the perfect way to drink Napa Valley wine, in a fancy glass. Carry-o 
I love these thin wine glasses....I can not enjoy a glass of wine in a thick glass....I have ordered many sets of these and given them as gifts...but for some reason I break them when drying them with a dish towel...I have never put them in my dish washer and I always make sure the glass is warm when I wash it..but I guess they are super fragile and need to be air dried. In spite of this problem I will again order another set, as I cannot drink a good glass of wine in a thick rimmed glass 
This particular model is simply unsuitable for use, as the girth of this glass is too large to hold securely. Although impressive visually, the execution of this glass is poor as it is impractical for use safely and comfortably. As an owner of many of the Sommeliers series glasses from Riedel, the "O" Chardonnay glass is a blatant disappointment. This selection will be returned to the seller 
While there are many positives to this line of glasses there is one thing that bothers me. When you drink from them you leave fingerprints. Normally on stemmed glasses they are not seen but with these glasses after several sips of your favorite wine the glasses are covered with fingerprints. Still love the shape though 
These glases are too big for practical use. Instead we recommend the Chardonnay/Voigner model. 
Very pleased with the glasses. We already had the cabernet glasses and wanted to add to the collection. they are such delicate crystal I feel like it's a special occasion when I use them. I also like the look as it is different than any other wine glasses we have. They are a great conversation piece 
The Riedel O Chardonnay is just the right size for informal gatherings with friends. It holds just the right amount too. A little more generous than the stem version. All my friends think it is a cool shape and you don't have to worry about breaking the stem when you set it down. I haven't broken one yet while washing them! Thats the best part 
This chair is so nice, and looks more expensive then it really is. Very easy to put togther (this chick did it all by herself in about 20 minutes) Very roomy and comfortable, I also got the matching ottoman, looks great 
Its very roomy. Bigger than I thought it was going to be (not in a bad way). Cozy. And very sleek and stylish. Looks much much more expensive than it is. Highly reccomended 
I was skeptical buying a chair with only a picture to go by. I'm glad I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I have a small room I use for an ofice and was looking for a corner chair that would be comfortable to sit in without a big footprint. This fits the bill. The chair is sturdy, the cushions comfortable and the assembly simple and straight forward. I'd recommend buying the ottoman to go with it. It's as well made as the chair and a perfect companio piece 
I love the end product. Has the appearance and feel of a chair worth twice the price and was exactly what I wanted. However!!! The instructions for assembly leave certain steps to the imagination. At one point in the assembly there were 2 possible ways to go. I guessed correctly and did not have to backtrack and take anything apart. A bit of a frustrating experience to say the least. Is the frustration worth it? Without a doubt 
the sleek clean lines, simplicity, and fabric make this piece of furniture very versatile. i have put it in my living room to coordinate with a modern theme, it can very easily fit into various other styles of design. it was easy to put together and was shipped farely fast. in terms of comfort it is in the moderate range and durabilty seems to be in that range as well. i have received several comments on the chair, all of which have been positive. for the price it is a good buy and recommend it highly. 
My title sums it up - I really had low expectations for this chair, but it performs like a champ. It's in our children's room, and it gets knocked about a good deal, but it still looks reasonably elegant (and much more expensive than it really is). I'd recommend it unconditionally; indeed I just bought another for my office :-) Worth every penny and then some 
Ordered (1) chair (1) Loveseat and (2) ottoman. Recived in 4 seperate shipments at 4 different dates. Chair was first to arrive but did not have hardware or instructions to put it together. Been 3 weeks now and I have called several times. You have to contact the manufacturer directly. At least they have an 800# so as I call EVERY day it's not costing me anything. Loveseat came with a little damage, that I can touch up myself. Overall for the price I paid for all this den furniture, I would have rather seen it in a store and taken delivery myself 
I love these chairs. &lt;br /&gt; They were not as difficult to put together as others have said. I get great compliments. They look like I bought them at one of the more expensive furniture stores. I have an antique wood table that I put in the middle and it looks great. People can't believe that I bought them from Target! I was lucky, I got them when they were on sale so it was a great deal. But the price is still good. My mother-in-law saw them and now I am online to buy her two for her little apt! Target has come a long way with their collection. &lt;br /&gt; 
This is a great little pot for sauteeing onions before adding a 28 oz. can of Italian tomatoes, or for risotto for 1 to 4 people. Don't be put off by the small size; if you cook for one or two people and appreciate QUALITY cookware then this is the pot for you. Worth every penny. 
I got this to use with the Glorious ONE POT MEALS cookbook. It has wonderful recipies, and the pot works wonderful. Cleans up really easy. Try it, you'll love it. Sharon From Colorad 
I started buying Le creuset after watching the cooking shows on the Cooking Netwook. So many of the cooks use this cookware even if they have there own line like Emeril. Very expensive but well worth the money. 
I can't believe how much I actually use this pot. It's great for roasts and braising. It's fantastic for boiling pasta or for deep frying big batches of onion rings for all the neighbors. It takes a while to heat up but once it hit it's temp, it does not cool down. My wife is a klutz and she's dropped the lid several times. Not one ding or chip. It's pretty easy to clean, too. Sometimes it takes a bit of Bar Keepers Friend and a little elbow grease but it looks so nice you can bring it from oven to table. I expect my children to fight over this the day after my funeral. Maybe I need another 
I agree with those reviewers who've said that this 2-quart oven is not something you'll be making stews or casseroles in. It's too small for that. It is, however, absolutely perfect for cooking grains, which is why it gets more daily use in my kitchen than my bigger french ovens do. It's fabulous for rice, oatmeal, grits, you name it. The fact it performs beautifully both on the stovetop and the oven makes it excellent for pilafs, since you can execute every aspect of pilaf production in the same pot. This is a very worthwhile addition to anybody's kitchen 
I so enjoy this pot. It heats evenly and retains heat. I can make a pot of something after school and then turn the stove/oven off and the food is still fairly warm when the kids want dinner. With the two quart size, I can experiment effortlessly with healthier (no salt) dishes for myself while the family enjoys something else. It's a pretty pan that lives on our stove, a gentle reminder to drag out a cookbook and try something new. It's cooking literally outside the box. :- 
I got tired of burning my stocks with thin-walled junk pots and decided to do some research. This pot is a big improvement over the standard Cuisinart line of pots and pans and is on par with the better All-Clad pots and other high-end brands. The fit and finish on this unit is excellent and the lid fits like a glove. This is a true 3 layer walled pot... no welded discs to the bottom of the unit (like the bargain stock-pot in the All-Clad brand line-up). Compare the price of this pot with the 'real' 3-wall constructed pots and you'll see a 2-3x improvement in price. I've used this pot ~20 times since I purchased it (each time for multi-hour stock simmering) and it still looks like new. Highly recommended 
As the description describes, this salt and pepper shaker set is stable and durable especially in the dishwasher. However, if one fills each shaker to capacity they become quite heavy, perhaps too heavy to be passed comfortably at dinner. The shakers are not demarcated and the head design is such that they would look substantially similar. One shaker has four holes and the other has three thus it become confusing as to which condiment is in which container. Still though, I will take durability over the other drawbacks 
This trivet is plastic and not shure how it will stand up to high temperatures. Nothing in the packaging states this also. I know that melamine does burn. I probably would not have purchased if description had stated it was not stoneware 
We ordered this item, and it's not only useful as a trivet to place hot pots on, but also great to use as a oven mitt. It's very flexible so when I pulled out a hot cookie sheet my fingers didn't get burned! I highly recommend it. It is a bit tricky to grasp the hot items, but you just have to arranget it so 
This is the best coffee maker - Had to buy the replacement carafe becasue I foolishly broke the original carafe by leaving it in the sink while washing other dishes. Found it on amazon - had the cheapest price!! 
Used the original for 2 years and broke the carafe in sink. Ordered this replacement. It was perfect. Good price, good delivery, product as promised. 
The carafe was a perfect replacement for the one that I broke. I received the product within a few days. Thank you. 
Krups is the ultimate in coffee makers. A gourmet delight. The flavor and aroma are the chefs delight. The carafe is artistically and designed to please your eye. It is functional and easy to clean. The price is economical. Buy by all means 
The toaster does not seem to cool well between repeated toasting cycles (only 2-3). With the heat control kept the same, the second toasting is much darker than the first and the third will be almost burned 
I read alot of the reviews before buying this toaster. Some of them we not good ones but I bought the toaster anyway because of the features that it offered. First of all the color of the toater is great and it matches my kitchen perfectly. It doesn't take up too much room on the countertop because it is somewhat slim. It does all of the things it professes to do. It does sometimes cook the toast more on one edge so it doesn't look "perfect" but it is not that big of a difference that it ruins the toast. It by no means chars it - it is just a little bit darker. I tried the frozen feature and loved it. I had some homemade frozen waffles and it thawed them and then heated them perfectly. I would buy this toaster again if I needed a toaster. I really like it alot 
This toaster disappointed. Overprized and does not live up to the KitchenAid name. Toasting is uneven and edges burn easy. I still regret ever buying it 
I should have read these reviews instead of trusting the KitchenAid name when I bought this toaster. From day one, it has never toasted evenly any breadlike substance - fresh / frozen / refrigerated, bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it. See the photo I uploaded - toast is burnt and raw at the same time!! Pass on this one 
I had this toaster for under 3 years when I came home one day and it smoked and died. I have to agree that it didn't toast evenly but at least it looked cool and worked. Now, Kitchen Aid wants me to pay $52 for a pro-rated replacement (which is supposed to be Half Price)and I can buy it here for $63. I always thought people paid more for Kitchen Aid because of the reliability factor. A one year warranty on a $100 TOASTER makes no sense. I wanted something better than the $9.99 drugstore models and got a mediocre (though cool looking) toaster that lasted less than 3 years. I am VERY dissatisfied and will not buy another Kitchen Aid product. 
The digital that I have is a great way to get perfect toast. If anyone burns there toast, it's not the toasters fault, they don't know how to cook 
This was a great toaster, until it starting turning itself on. After popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on. KitchenAid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model, YET. Don't Bu 
This is avery attractive and functional product that performs nicely as advertisied. Although, I used the free and slowest shipping option, the product arrived a week eralier than Amazon estimated it would. Good deal. Glen 
I've had this toaster for four years now. It just started going down hill recently. -It started toasting too darkly on the settings I had consistently used for years. -The digital setting knob no longer works, it is stuck on 4. -It only shuts off when manually popped up. I have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even. I've noticed this in my four years of use. So if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it. If not, try another with better reviews 
TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK. EXPENSIVE JUNK AT THAT. ATTACHMENTS HARD TO USE. CAP SEIZED WOULDN'T OPEN FOR REFILL. NO REPLY FROM ONLINE TECH.IT LOOKS STURDY AND WELL MADE BUT IT'S USELESS. I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS IN THIS FORUM BEFORE I WASTED MY MONEY. 
Worked great for one week. Hope I can return it. 
It worked great the first time, but the second time it was absolutely no good. The cap seized after the second use and the whole unit turned when I tried to get the cap off. It's garbage now. I wrote to them and the answer I got was a totally different answer for the question I asked. 
This piece of junk gave out after about 10 uses. Steam shoots out from behind the trigger making it impossible to hold 
Like many of the other reviewers, I have experienced the same problems. At first the steamer appeared to work O.K. However, it soon began to leak steam from the hose and became very dangerous. Today the cap seized and would not come off. The entire unit turns when you try to turn the cap. I will call the company tomorrow, and if I am not satisfied with the response, I will file a complaint with the State Atorney General's office 
I purchased one of the shark pro steamers and used it once. Came back to it a month later and the cap had seized totally shut. They are aware of the problem but fail to document it or do anything about it. The steamer is about 100 buck and to send it back for repair is 25 buck shipping and another 50 to Inspect. For that price I should just toss it in the trash or use it as a $100 paper weight that's all it's good for. Don't buy anything from euro pro!!!! they make junk. 
What a piece of junk. I bought this machine finally today as it was the only one available in any store near me and I didn't want to go with the $250 Fantom one advertised on HSN or QVC so I thought I would try a cheaper one ($100 is not cheap) to see if these products work. Well I agree with anyone else who says it doesn't work. I have used it all this afternoon and get about 10 minutes worth of cleaning done with each load of water. My oven looks still horrible as it didn't even attempt to touch anything caked on. It ripped all the paint off the top of my stove (and I have found out that is about $450 to replace the top of my stove to have it looking nice again, thanks Europro). The only thing it did help with was my gaskets around the fridge. They were black and really disgussting because nothing not even a toothbrush could get in there and they are somewhat clean but while cleaning it sprays filth absolutely everywhere so you end up doing more than double the work to get it looking somewhat clean but the filth it sprays all over your walls is not easy to steam off and I ended up having to use Fantastic to get it off the walls. I am going to take this back to the store tomorrow and get the $250 one as all the reviews I have read for the Fantom is great. Sorry Europro but your products do not seem to last more than a couple of days. I also bought the Shark cordless vaccum and although it was great in the beginning it broke after a few uses. Anyone who says this product actually works must have a spotlessly clean appliance to begin with as it doesn't even come close to what they advertise on tv. I will never be scammed again 
These are the best dog leashes we've owned. Everything about them is high quality and best of all; they are made in the USA! I have two different patterns for my two dogs. The puppy got a hold of the leash and chewed it up, Lupine replaced it promptly. 
I have never been happier with a kitchen knife. It is sharp, weighted perfectly, and elegant to boot. If you purchase this knife, you can throw away all of your other kitchen knives of comparable purpose 
I've been a long time J.A. Henckels user and love there knives, but my Shun classic has quickly made it's way to the most used knife in my bag. When I first got this knife I was afraid to use it in the day to day world of my job because of it's good looks, but unlike most knives that just rely on there good looks for the selling point, this knife is a true work horse. The handle did feel a little strange at first but once you get used to it, you understand why it was made that way. As a Chef, I recomend this knife to any santoku lover, it was well worth the price. 
very good knife, althrough the Hollow Ground was a big deal. But to me 8 inch chief is too big. 
This knife is absolutely amazing. Cuts through chicken and other meat like a hot knife through butter. Be extremely careful while cutting 
This Shun knife (like all the others) is a terrific high quality blade. They are perfect! I hate to use the term "Balanced" in a knife review but it really feels great in the hand. The "D shaped grip" feels nice, and the knife really holds an edge 
The good reviews sum it up aptly, but I would like to add that after owning a set of Henckels I grew to loathe in the extreme (they never hold an edge and sharpening is not cheap!), and after testing every set at Williams-Sonoma, Shun D-shaped handles are the perfect fit for those with hands smaller than the average (seemingly German) male for whom almost all kitchen equipment is designed (nevermind that most people actually cooking in most homes on a daily basis are women). Rant aside, this knife is all that and a bag of chips. Tomatoes are a breeze with this knife - as is everything else I have thrown at it so far. They are insanely sharp, and they really hold an edge. My food prep time has been cut in half since owning this and the Ken Onion chef knife. They're just so much sharper and they don't slip around because they really fit my hand and have the perfect heft. If you can only afford one good knife, I'd probably pick the Shun chef knife although the handle of the santoku is better and it can do most everything the chef's knife can do. But if you can afford it, get them both - you won't need anything else 
This is a great knife, everyone agrees. But is this knife that much better than its cheaper competitors? (MAC, Wustoff etc knives which cost over $40). After purchasing this knife, I am convinced it is not. This knife is very sharp indeed and you won't complain about its sharpness. But some of the reviews in Amazon hype it to a point where it can cut through anything. No, this isn't a Ginsu (not the TV commercial version anyway) and it can't cut through nails. The reviews on other high quality knives (especially MAC knives) are just as good. In fact, one consumer quality magazine rates the MAC knives over the Shun. My guess is that those knives are just as sharp and good since the sharpness of this knife isn't awe inspiring 
I've decided to go with MAC brand santoku after reading several reviews. 
11/11/06 Update: I can say now that I have no regrets. This knife is actually my favorite knife and the one I reach for first. I have to force myself to use my chef's knife. My Shuns are still sharp! I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives. I finally stepped up and got excellent knives. For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world. [...] Great features of the entire line include these cool "D" shaped handles that fit your hand better. Each knife is made in a right- and left-handed version [...]. The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives. The knives are EXTREMELY sharp. One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives. The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle. About the 7" scalloped santoku ... this is my first Shun knife. It is honestly the sharpest knife I have ever used. I minced onion with relatively no effort. I didn't feel any resistance while cutting and the job went amazingly quickly. I have small hands and this knife felt perfect. The weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand. I will have to make adjustments to my grip as I get used to the knife. (I used the traditional grip you would use on a German blade chef's knife my hand slipped toward the blade.) This knife will not replace my chef's knife, but it will see a lot of action. This is an expensive, but lifetime investment. I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website. For ratings on various brands and types of knives[...] This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of. I can't wait until the rest of the set arrives. 
I have a Shun Santoku, and it is very nice -- a good, sharp cutting knive. However, I have found something even better for roughly the same cost -- a Kin. The Kin is more decorative, just as sharp, and offers that extra cache of owning a smaller brand (more exclusive). Try a Kin --[...]-- and get Amazon to carry them. 
AAA+++ This press lives up to it's marketing description. My only concern is how to replace the glass insert. I tried a generic replacement, and although it fit okay, the pouring lip is narrower than the original and leaks at the edges. How do I get an original glass replacement 
This bathmat is a perfect match to the towels. It is a little larger than expected and is a bathmat not a bath rug, therefore there are no rubber grippers. The mat is exactly as pictured, the weave is slightly different on each side 
The Salter 1400 scale is great. I use it for carbohydrate counting and find it very convenient to use. I especially like being able to use the built-in program which gives me the the nutritional information for the exact weight of the item I have put on the scale 
This product is sturdy and has plenty of room for my 9.5 lb shih tzu. It's easy to use, and Lucy loves it. The only thing I wish is that there was an option to purchase a well-made carrying case to put crate in when not in use and we need to tote it from one place to another. For example, I'd like to be able to check it at the airport and feel that it's somewhat protected. (Lucy travels on-board w/ us in an airline approved pet carrier.) 
In the past I have used the old stand by wire crates for my dogs. I recently got a new puppy (a Maltipoo) who is smaller than the dogs I have had in the past, so I was looking for a smaller wire crate, when I found this. I love it! This crate is easy to take up and down. When visiting relatives, it is very easy to pack up and take with us. With soft sides, I frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping. The "walls" on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate. I bought the small, which gives him plenty of room to move around. At night I have him sleeping in a small airline crate. He is getting too big for that, so I am thinking of getting the extra small for night time use. 
Don't plan on using this as an all-purpose crate. Puppies will chew through it if you try to use it as a permanent training crate. It wasn't intended to be treated as airline baggage. I got it primarily to get my puppy through her first long car trip home. I'm now using it as a safe way to take her on short trips and to train her to ride. She seems to find it very secure, comfortable, and reassuring. It sets up and folds quickly and easily. It is light and easy to handle, but very sturdy. I use it mostly in the passenger seat of my car, but wouldn't mind putting it in the back with my adult dog -- something I wouldn't dream of with a hard metal crate. The one time the puppy upchucked, the cleanup was trivial. The bottom pan is held in place by velcro; it got pulled out in a few seconds and then got hosed down. The soft pad got hosed down and thrown into the washer and dryer. I don't plan to use this more than a few months, but at the end of that time I expect to have a sturdy, confident and happy dog traveler 
I bought this soft sided pet crate in hopes that my new Yorkie Terrier, Brando, would have a safe haven to welcome him home. Since he is such a tiny guy, this crate offers both a play area and a bedroom. The construction is very durable and the color (red, my favorite) is fun. I particularly like the three entries and the two storage pouches, one of which is detachable. So far, he is enjoying the crate. I like the fact that the sides are soft, since he is still in his wobbly stage. This was a great buy for us. Be Blessed 
I purchased these sheets for my daughter in law for Christmas. She washed them as directed and went to put them on her bed. Each corner on the fitted sheet the threads were pulling out. Very poorly made 
Sadly these lovely sheets are already showing threads after just 2 washes (in delicate cycle) A good purchase at the time but sadly not a quality keeper 
We love these sheets. You can immediately tell how soft they are. They are the best sheets we've ever owned and plan to get more 
Purchased a set of the 400-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Ivory color before the end of 2005 at the price of $39.99 here at Amazon. The package arrived on schedule. However, the quality of the materials "Egyptian Cotton" is far less satisfactory. Compared this set to a few sets of my other Egyptian Cotton sheets, Elegance's sheet set is rougher and stiffer even after two full-cycle washes. I'd say stay away from this item if you are looking for quality Egyptian Cotton sheet sets. 
Before I bought this item I had been curious as to what it would feel like, and what the big deal was over a 400 thread count, like whats' the big deal right? Well I have a daughter with Aspergers Syndrome and the second I put the sheets on my bed, I had her come in, she noticed the sky blue sheets looked metalic and she sat on the bed. With in seconds she was rolling on my queen sized log bed, happy and not wanting to leave. That is how I knew I had the winning approval. I highly recommend this brand to anyone that wants to sleep comfortably. Now I have to order my daughter a set for Christmas! Carol Hammons WA stat 
the thread count is excellent on these egyptian cotton sheets, really something worth considering. its like sleeping on clouds, in heaven, in the sky, where god lives. 
They were advertised as having deep pockets but found it almost impossible to get the bottom sheet on my queen size mattress-almost sprained a finger getting the last corner on. This was after only one washing in cold water. Smoothness was o.k., but too much work getting them on the mattress. 
I followed the instructions carefully, washed only in cold water, tumble dry extra low, etc. but these sheets still shrank. Also terrible pilling after only a few months. I do not recommend. The sheets were wrinkly, but I could live with that, but not the pilling, which makes them uncomfortable to sleep on 
These sheets are great. They were slightly wrinkled right out of the pack, but wrinkles fell out relatively quickly. They are very soft and will be the best 30 bucks you will ever spend on linen 
Wow are these some soft sheets, even straight out of the package. After I washed them they came out soft and not wrinkled. They dried well and held their shape. Very nice 
this product is not worth its high cost. The bubbles in the water gauge is a hassle--I have to "burp" it with almost every pot. The spring on the filter basket spout broke almost immediately. I also have to agree that the coffee is not very hot. I have used this for 18 months or so. This product needs work 
This was a wedding gift a little over a year ago. With one time daily use the basket is broken (It had been limping along for 6 months) and has always filled the water meter with bubbles so I had to get used to knowing how much water I was putting in by estimation. This is cheap, I am so sorry my grandma paid so much for this unit. She was trilled with it because she thought she was buying me a coffee maker I could have for a long time. I will be buying a bunn. 
I was a bit concerned after reading all the reviews about the plasticy taste. The coffee I made from day one was phenomenal. There was nothing like a plastic taste at all. Yum! I love how long the coffee stays hot in the carafe. It's always hot without being superheated. The carafe has a pretty big lip around the top to help keep everything warm, so it can be a bit difficult to get the last cup or two out. But I am an able bodied person and can work that extra bit to get every last drop out. The bubble in the water gage? The reviews make it sound like it can't be fixed. When the coffee maker is empty (no water or no carafe) just tip the unit back a bit until the bubble goes away. Easy as pie. To prevent the bubble from ever forming, it's a good idea to pour the water smoothly. It sounds silly but it works. I highly recommend this coffee maker. It is just as good as my french press with less grounds in the coffee and less mess to clean up. Enjoy 
This coffee maker is not up to the usual Krups standard. The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work. Everything on this machine looks and feels cheap-plastic. Also, why does Krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase? Older model filters never fit in the newer models. If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out. The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle. I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase 
Granted, I have only had this coffee maker for a whopping three months, but so far, so good. Positive things: it really does brew a nice cup of coffee, and very quickly at that. I have yet to see if it stops dripping if the pot is removed while brewing, because it simply hasn't been necessary. The little "ding ding" it gives when it's finished is a nice touch for me, as it tends to help me snap out of my morning trance. Not so great things: it's solid stainless steel, so you have to rely to a certain degree on the water mark area to see just how much water you're pouring in, and it can bubble up and become useless. I've gotten pretty good at gauging it, though, so it's not a big deal. Also, again, it is stainless steel, which means it gets marked up pretty readily. If you are a clean freak, you'll be rubbing it daily. At this point, though, I'd buy it again 
We have gotten concerned about non-stick coatings so we switched to stainless. After buying my last teflon pan that contained the warning about not using it near a pet bird's cage! They can suffocate from the fumes...whoa, we don't need to be breathing that either! Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless 12-Inch Omelet Pan is wonderful However, it is not rated no. 1 by Martha or America's Test Kitchen like the overpriced All Clad overpriced pan. I spent $75 on the Calphalon and it is the best pan I've ever enjoyed. My sister in law has the All-Clad, she regrets spending too much after trying mine. I don't put it through the dishwasher, and eggs don't stick if you cook on med.-low 
This pan was highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen, and they were not kidding! The wide bottom holds a lot of meat and browns it nicely, with hardly any sticking. Retains heat better than my nonstick pan. Larger cuts such as whole pork tenderloins and thick-cut pork chops can go straight from stove-top searing to oven-roasting. Not too heavy, and very smooth at the bottom - great for glass-top stoves! Cleans up nicely, too. This will be your no. 1 pan for browning meat 
This product renewed my espresso maker to "new" condition. The beverage tastes fresh like it did when the machine was new. And the seller was a pleasure to deal with....Quick to ship 
I didn't know what to get to clean my coffee maker (the coffee was starting to taste really gross), but I'm glad I found this stuff. It worked really well, it's easy to use, and it works for both my drip coffee maker and my espresso machine 
This product works very well. One 'brew' with the cleaner and two brews with plain water to rinse, and the entire coffee maker looks like new. Wish the shipping didn't cost nearly as much as the product itself (which is why I went ahead and bought 2 boxes), but even so, it's worth the price 
I purchased enough to stock up for my espresso machine because I seem to have to descale it quite often.... It was inexpensive and works well 
Revere makes great cookware if you stay away from their budget line. This makes the second 3-quart that I own of theirs 
I only use Revereware cookware with copper bottoms. My husband, who is a mechanical engineer, states that cookware with copper bottoms is the best conductor of surface heat. I totally agree. My Revereware has lasted me for 20 years, at least, and is still going strong. I wanted another pan and couldn't find it in any store in our area. So, I got on-line and bingo! I'll be ordering another smaller pan in the near future, but am happy to have found Revereware through Amazon. 
The pan was very nice and I was very please with the Amazon experienc 
I ordered this pan beacuse I liked the old RevereWare pan I have had and wanted another. I received this pan and could not believe how much lighter and of less quality it was as compared to the original RevereWare pan I have had for years. I looked on the botom of the new pan and it is made in China. IS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I returned the pan. I would not recommend this pan to anyone. 
I bought one of these recently. The bottom warped after the first couple of uses, making it useless on my glass top stove. I tried to contact Revere about it with no response. 
I love the sauce pan. I have one that I had for 20 years. That' sauce pan is still being used. I plan to buy another sauce pan just like it soon 
The other reviewer is right about old Revere Ware; its great stuff that'll last forever. However, newer Revere Ware, like what's being advertised here, is total junk. I own an old 2qt saucepan and a brand new 4.5qt Dutch oven. The Dutch oven is flimsy and the lid doesn't fit well. If you want good Revere Ware make sure it's from the USA (not Indonesia, like the new stuff) and OLD. Try yard sales or ebay. The only thing to recommend new Revere ware is the 25 year warranty. That is the only way the old and new products are comparable. 
I inherited my grandomother's Revereware, which she used when I was little. That was more than 20 years ago, and I still use the pots and pans today! I have no idea how long she had this cookware, but it wasn't new when I got it. Revere backs their lifetime warranty...the handle of one of my lids finally wore out. I called them to buy a replacement, but they sent me one free! I would recommend Revereware to anyone. I just bought my son a new set for his wedding present...I expect it will last his lifetime 
Do not advertise if not available. Have been looking for this product for soom time. My sister ruined the one I had. You advertised this product on a cleareance sale. What is wrong 
This is one great coffee maker. Bunn has don't a great job with this coffee maker 
We purchased this coffee maker to replace a Mr. Coffee that failed after just 4 short months. This coffee maker is great. It brews the coffee in under 3 minutes and the coffee actually tastes good. This is a great coffee maker for anyone who loves coffee 
Bunn makes excellent products and having fresh brewed coffee in three minutes is the cat's meow 
I've had this coffee maker for about a week now and really like it. The speed of the brew is hard to believe. This morning it took less than three minutes to brew a full 10 cup pot of coffee. I'm using a store brand of ground coffee and this brewer makes it taste as good as a coffee shop's! You do have to get used to the higher temperature at first, but that's what makes the coffee taste so good. I also like the simple, basic design of this Bunn. There is another Bunn model that is a redesign that is supposed to be sleeker and more modern, but I actually like this one better because you don't have to slide the lid to pour in the cold water for brewing. This model has a basic flip up lid that I think is easier to use and will last longer. I just noticed that this one is now going for around $80 bucks (I got mine for $88) so it is an even better deal today. Highly recommended 
No clock is needed for automatic brewing. Those that do have clocks and use them, are they really automatic? All the prep has to be done the night before. If you set it wrong, you don't have your coffee in the morn. Anyways, this Bunn coffee maker is simple, FAST and makes the best tasting coffee I have ever had. Bunn has focused on coffee making, not on gadgets with clocks, timers and a bunch of gizmo gimmicks. My stove has a clock my microwave has a clock, there is a clock on the wall, a watch on my wrist and a clock on my phone, etc. etc., Do I need another clock in the kitchen? Hmmmmm. NO! The Bunn machine is durable and reliable. Makes no disgusting noises during brewing like most other machines do. Good for you Bunn! Bunn keeps the water hot at all times, starts spitting out coffee as soon as you close the lid. A full pot of coffee in 3 minutes or less!If you need a coffee maker, this is it. 
This coffee pot (bunns in general)are the cream of the crop. Thank you. 
This is the absolutely best coffee maker that I have ever owned. I bought mine 4 years ago, and it still works as well as the first day I got it. I bought another for a gift for my in-laws. Anyone who loves coffee must invest in a Bunn 
I ran out of butter so I didn't butter these molds. I used them because I had too much batter from Nigella's quadruple chocolate loaf cake. Even though this was not a madeleine recipe and I did not prep the mold, the cakes popped out with a poke from the bottom of the mold. This replaces my wearever tin mini muffin pan as my absolute shape for my homemade baking. I like the way the madeleine shape (even though not a madeleine recipe) fits between my fingers. It's a charming physical movement 
this pump is great i went to the local pet smart and they let me plug it in at the store and listen to the different pumps. price was no option and it just happened to be 19.99 when i bought it for my 10 gallon aquarium price was no option to me just the most silent pump i could find. so far it has been excellent i gave it a four star because after a few weeks it does get louder but i just plugged in another pump for the day and let it cool down and it was back to normal. i have had for 2 months by the day of 9/23/0 
After trying for years to find a suitable rack for a small roaster that we use constantly, I found this little gem. It withstands the oven temps and the dishwasher heat and after many usings, still looks like new! It may outlast the little roaster (now 50 years old!) 
For $7.99 this is such a great pan! It came well seasoned and was ready to use. To my surprise it did NOT stick! I used to use stainless steel pans which stick like crazy. This pan performs as good as those teflon pans, but without the worry about harmful substances. The handle is also long enough so my hand would not be burned 
Purchased this as a gift and was very suprised with the heft and the quality of this pan. If you are looking for a great pan at a great price you won't find better. Would buy another here if I needed one 
I had purchased this on a whim. I was browsing Amazon and noticed that the 10 1/2" skillet was on sale. Knowing that I would eventually need one in the kitchen I picked it up. Am I ever happy I did. I cannot live without this anymore. I use the skillet for everything. On a gas stovetop it evenly distributes the heat and food is ready in minutes. Goes from stovetop to oven easily and cleaning is a breeze thanks to the preseasoning at the factory + my additional preseasoning. With proper care, I expect this to last me a long time in my kitcken 
WELL MADE, WELL DESIGNED CAST IRON SKILLET. WILL LAST FOREVER FOR UNDER 10 BUCKS 
Once you've tried cast iron pans you'll never go back. We have a full set of All-Clad, and since getting our cast iron skillet we basically never use the expensive All-Clad skillet. The key is to season the pan before and after use (wipe down with peanut oil), and never scour it clean. In very short order the seasoning becomes non-stick, but unlike "real" non-stick, it's indestructible, cheap, browns well, and heats incredibly evenly. Yeah it's heavy, and it sounds weird to say my skillet has never been washed with soap, but trust me. At single digit prices, what do you have to lose? (This review applies to ANY and ALL cast iron skillets you see, not just this one. This ain't rocket science. It's a hunk of iron. They're all basically the same.) 
A nice little product, well designed. You can put a container on first, reset to zero, then add content to the container and get weight only for the contents and not the container. Cool. It's attractive, too, and I think it's fairly priced. * The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the little moon-shaped pads, in the lid that doubles as a tray for weighing, came off immediately because they were not securely glued on. I can re-glue them so it's not a big problem and certainly doesn't interfere with the functioning of the scale, but it demotes the product by one star. 8= 
We love the scale and it works great in the kitchen or eating out. It has been used every day, several times a day for the last 8 months. I just replaced the batteries for the first time last week. 
Wasn't sure what to expect for the price, but it works great! I individually portion out my snacks now, and it works perfect for that 
I really like this product! It's small size makes it very portable and the display is easy to operate. Works well with bowls, but a little tougher to use with plates unless you raise the plate slightly with some sort of stand and adjust for the additional weight. Thank heavens for the HOLD feature 
Wonderful little gadget to have around in the house for weighing anything from letters to jewelry! Very accurate. Am quite pleased with it 
After reading over the reviews on this and a couple other scales, I settled on this one and I am very happy I did! It's pocket size has made eating out so much easier. And it's digital readout is absolutely wonderful. I fix many meals at a time and seperate into smaller 'serving size' packets. This scale has made measuring out 2 oz of protein so much easier. The reset key is great too. I can use either the top as a measuring tray or my own plates. What a wonderful kitchen gadget 
a very convenient scale for small quantities in the photo lab. so far is everything I need for this application 
The Polder 932-00 Pocket Size Digital Scale is great for monitoring the calories you eat. I have purchased other scales and returned them because they are not accurate in the ounce range and are too big. The Polder is very accurate and very easy to use. It uses the units of grams and ounces. These units match all ingredient labels on food. The tare feature allows me to weigh more items at the same time. I always use the tray for weighing food since it is so easy to wash. The best part is that I can weigh my food after it is cooked. This allows me to eat more food since food shrinks on cooking. The scale's tray is also a cover for the scale. I have taken it on trips, and it works well. The only shortfall is that the scale is very efficient and turns itself off sometimes before I am done. Now that I know this, I work around it. I also purchased another one for my daughter. 
Great compact size and very accurate reading. I use it for my bodybuilding diet, to measure with I eat and its easy to use and very accurate. Great buy Update: April 2007 I've had this scale for over 1 year now and is still working great. No problems and never even replaced the batteries yet. I use this about 6 times a day measuring all my food. I highly recommend this scale 
I bought it to measure more accurately how much protein powder I use in smoothies I make, but I'm sure I'll put it to use measuring other things as well. I compared it with a larger kitchen scale, and it matches the result but has a finer resolution than the kitchen scale. So it seems fairly accurate. Make sure there is no breeze, because that will throw the measurement off a little. It's a cute little gadget. Fits in the palm of your hand and has all the functionality of a larger weight scale. Very useful, and a good value 
This spatula is super thin (but not flimsy)!!! Unlike many other turners this one is thin so it slides under everything easily. rather than ruining them like many thicker turners. A great buy 
A little more money that the average spatula, but very nice. Another example of "you get what you pay for" 
One of the mortars (3.5" diameter mortars) broke just after a week. I used it for nuts (almonds and walnuts) and hand washed it everyday. 
These mortar and pestles are used mainly for crushing perscription medicines. They work very well for this purpose and are great for traveling, since they are light weight. An excellent product 
These are excellent products for the price and great to have around......even if will never use them 
I shopped around all my local discount stores and drug stores and could not find this item at most, or when I did, it was an overpriced arty (not functional) version. This set was less expensive than the single mortar and pestle I was able to find (which was only one - they're very hard to find)and of much better functional quality (I believe someone else mentioned the non-glazed interior, which keeps stuff from sliding around; that is, easier to pulverize with the pestle). I'm very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it 
I like that you get three different sizes for what you would pay for one mortar and pestle retail. You can use each one for a different purpose if you were afraid of cross contamination. They are ceramic, but very sturdy and heavy. It is a good product. 
I bought this mostly for the smallest mortar, to grind up the dog's pills. Works better than an electric grinder, and it's faster. Excellent value 
I am using these mortars in the kitchen for various purpose such as grinding spices. Excellent quality at reasonable price 
Really nice set for the money. Grinding surfaces are textured just like the more expensive sets. Lots of flexibility with 3 different sizes. Why spend more? Great buy for any cook 
this mortat and pestle do the job i used them right away.. grinding up herbs.. they work wonderfully. i have seen the same item for 39.99 for the set your price seems to low.. but they do the job. thanks Harley Reinbol 
I purchased this ice cream scoop after I ruined one of the antifreeze scoops by washing it in the dishwasher. The scoop works well. However, although it was advertised as dishwasher safe, the inside of the scoop has begun to pit. Also, the handle collects water in the dishwasher, which slowly leaks out in the drawer. I'm tossing it 
This was a great scoop. Worked well, looks nice, flashy, but it started to degrade after a year or so. At first it was juat a little mark inside the scoop but it grew. I put up with it but now it's rusting. Nothing worse then scooping out orange vanilla ice cream. For the price I paid, I would have expected this scoop to last longer. Yeah, it's flashy, but I wanted longevity. Next time I'll buy a cheaper scoop 
My wife and I purchased the black model of this item 4 years ago. We have used the scooper on average once a week and absolutely love it. It's solidly built, has a comfortable grip, and performs as good as the day we bought it. We have never had a problem with ice cream sticking to the scoop surface. After all these years, the only wear-and-tear is a slight abrasion to the chrome scoop on the underside (probably due to the scooper sliding inside our drawer as we open/close it quickly). The abrasion has not caused any sticking. Highly recommend 
This is quite simply the best ice cream scoop ever made. My prior favorite was an ice cream scoop by Tupperware, but this Kitchen Aid ice cream scoop takes the cake and makes serving ice cream effortless. It's sturdy, it's big and it cuts through hard ice cream without any problems. I have the red one and the color is beautiful. Go ahead and buy one, you won't be disappointed and it will be the last ice cream scoop you will ever have to buy (unless you lose it) 
My mother-in-law has this Kitchen Aid "scoop" version. It's good, but not as good as the "spade" version. I give it 4 stars by comparison. If you must have round ice cream balls for an ice cream cone, then you could get this, however the spade works much better for scooping ice cream, cutting through easily and scooping plenty. You could still make a "ball" if you really wanted to with the spade. I've had my Kitchen Aid Spade for 2 years. It is THE best ice cream scoop(spade) ever. No matter how cold or hard the icecream/yogurt is, the spade cuts right through. These Kitchen Aid "scoops" or "spades" are better than the types with anti-freeze type liquid which supposedly helps. Don't bother -- these Kitchen Aid scoops cut through anything. The handle is perfect, and the whole thing is well-balanced (for both the spade and scoop).  5 stars for the Spade, 4 stars for the Scoop. I'd even pay twice as much for the Kitchen Aid Spade if required 
I got this icecream scoop as part of a set. Not only does it look great in my kitchen, I just made banana splits tonight for my kids and it cut through the icecream effortlessly. Love the color, love the product! 
I was amazed how my cat loves to watch this DVD. When he hears the music, he runns in front of the TV and enjoys his show. He follows the bird carefully with his head. He is having a blast 
It meets every expectation for a hot plate. I am using this for a stove top in an area in our house that is being made into an apartment 
The Toastmaster 6432 is very performant, heats up very fast and you can easily cook anything on it i 
Like others - the large burner is out - after less than a year of use. Will look for another brand to replace 
I have had this unit for over 2 years and everything still works just as good as the day I bought it. I use it as my only stove almost daily as I live in a basement apartment. The only problem I have with it is that it takes a while to heat to the point of boiling but once there it stays hot. 
Bad quality, not so durable. Large burner died with 2 months of normal use. I put this product in the trasher 
We bought ours some time ago and have enjoyed it. However, the large burner does not work now. Based on the problems getting it serviced and the real possibility of yet another failure, I plan to break into it and try to fix it, even though it's in warranty. Would definitely not recommend the purchase 
I work in a beautiful old building, with circulation that isn't the best, and we have trouble creating even temperatures across rooms. I bought one of these Duracraft Tower Fans for my office, and then liked it well enough that I convinced our office manager to buy a second one for a small meeting room I sometimes use. The fan is thirty inches tall, and about four inches wide and three inches deep. It is molded white plastic. The fan had three speeds (Low, Medium, High), and can be set to oscillate or not. The fan creates a good strong airflow, and it is very quiet, with conversation needing slightly increased volume only when the fan is set on High. I find it ideal for creating a good airflow in rooms from seventy-five to one hundred fifty square feet, without using much floorspace. I have seen reviews of this product that indicate that it develops a loud, rattling noise, after two or three months of usage. For the two I have, this has not occurred, after almost a year of fairly frequent use. For those of you getting accustomed to my writing style, you might not be surprised by: "She sits quietly in the corner, a tall, slim, fair-skinned beauty. She is quite reserved about speaking, is never loud, and only causes a stir in the subtlest, most welcome fashion. Her sleek styling is quite fitting with her cool personality. She has yet to tell me her name, but I am always pleased with her presence. Perhaps, her name is Grace, after Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie, after Eva Marie Saint, from North by Northwest. Whatever her name might be, I am certainly glad to have her around, and I have met no one yet who objects to her. Who could resist her?" Pros: An effective fan for offices up to at least 150 square feet. Cons: None that I have found, thus far. The Bottom Line: I bought this fan for under $30, and it is easily worth that 
I am happy with the pricing - the plastic is a teeny tiny thinner than littermaid replacements - so not as sturdy as the actual littermaid receptacles and requires getting used to, and otherwise ok. I will buy them again. fast deliver 
Great pan. It's heavy enough not to burn things, easily cleans and measure on side is a help. Would not hesitate to recommend 
When I ordered this saucepan, I didn't realize how high the quality would be. When I opened the box and first lifted the saucepan, I was immediately impressed with the weight and quality. Each time that I use this pan to heat up foods, I am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook. Water boils very quickly. Lastly, the engraved measuring lines for liquids are extremely helpful. All in all, the best saucepan that I've owned 
We replaced our last two skillets because the non-stick surface scratched off rather quickly. I checked the reviews and gave this one a try. We are very happy with it. We were a little concerned at first thinking it would be too small to cook breakfast for our family of four, but it does the job just fine. It is very durable so far, my only problem with it is that the glass lid has no vent, so it steams up and you can't see the food well without lifting the lid. Over all, it is the best skillet we have tried so far 
This skillet is the best. Its shape and size are great. Its quality is remarkable and the non-stick coating is revolutionary. I have never seen non stick coating like this before. I highly recommend this skillet 
Can't beat this skillet for the price. It's a no-frills skillet that does the job well. I bought it based on my shopping around and reading the opinions here. It's heavier and I think better quality than the other Presto electric skillets that you can buy in all the department stores. Heats up quickly, cooks evenly, cleans up easily. A pleasure to use! I have fried fish, fried chicken, cooked omelets, done tempeh-veggie stir fry, etc. and all have turned out well. 
To tell you the truth I have never had this brand of Electric skillet nor have I had a professional brand, even though I have just purchased this electric skillet and have not really had a chance to see it's performance over the long haul but so far the few times I have used it, I have had no problems and I can say it is fast and heats up almost instantly. Does not burn or scorch the food and is a breeze to clean even easier than my Westbend electric skillet with a teflon interior, this Presto brand seems quite sturdy, handles are strong has a nice big handle on top of lid which is nice to hold. Skillet is heavy for heavy duty aluminum which is a very good feature and don't find that kind of quality in electric skillets nowadays, at this point I can tell you I am very happy with the purchase of this skillet and it far outweighed my expectations of the Presto brand. Even though I did not price this skillet anywhere else I believe I paid a lower price than I would have paid in the brick and mortar stores, Sure Source which was the seller of this skillet I might add was fast and my Skillet arrived in tact and working. If you want to purchase a brand that meets the sturdiness and versatility that this brand seems to offer then I would recommend this Professional style Skillet which also doubles as a server 
Presto's Electric Skillet and Server is one of the best! I use electric skillets quite frequently in cooking I find that Presto's electric skillet cooks evenly, washes easily and resists scratches better than the other brands. Reasonably priced, it is a good deal for everyday cooking needs 
We have had the skillet for several weeks, and have used it often. We are very pleased with the operation. My wife is the user, and she likes it very much. She appreciates the ease and convenience of using it. One thing I'm not happy with is, After ever use, I have to tighten the two handles on the pan, and the handle on the lid. They refuse to stay tight. I will probably get some Loctite to see if i can prevent any further loosening. Other than that one problem, we love the pa 
It is March and I still have not used my new electric skillet. It is beautiful - but there are only two of us in the house and it is definitely meant to cook for more people (in other words, quite large). I will critique as soon as I have an occasion to use this skillet. J 
An elegant cooking and serving piece that extends the amount of burners you have access to for entertaining 
I bought this frying pan as a gift for my Mother and had it shipped to California where she is taking care of my 99 year old grandfather. The packaging and papers were accidently thrown away. She tried to use the pan for a roast on Jan. 12th. and set the dial to 220 to roast slowly. When she checked it in a short time, the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer. No matter what setting, it just plain got scortching hot. There is supposed to be a one year warranty, but Amazon only takes returns in the first 30 days and in original packing. I tried to contact them but can find no contact information on the web. Someone should replace the defective part, but I don't know how to accomplish this 
We received one of these for Christmas and we can't stop using it. This skillet heats up fast, is a great size for anything and absolutely nothing sticks to it! It is perfect for making breakfasts which is why we are registering for another one for our upcoming wedding, that way everything we're making is all ready at the same time. It also doubles as a buffet server which is always handy for entertaining. I highly recommend one of these 
the product that is being sent out is NOT the product that is pictured. they are sending out an oblong platter with no handles made from STONEWARE (it's not even corelle). extremely unhappy!!! 
The machine was hard to assemble. It never worked so it will be difficult to tell you how well we liked it 
this thing rocks,if you get it youll have tons of slushie fun and lots o' brain freeze 
I bought this knife to accompany my current knife set well over a year ago. It stays sharp and I think it will last forever 
Easy to install and fits in any door in my house. Perfect for my Chihuahua to go in and out of while the other dogs stay out. 
The product arrived in good condition and arrived on time. The product was adequately packed for shipment 
Yeah, I tried seasoning a cast iron frying pan, never washed it just scrubbed it out with salt. It was much more work than any other gadget I have and it wasn't worth it. This is the perfect solution. The frying pan is perfect for searing rib eyes or filets and then popping them in the oven to roast which gives you a far better result than broiling them. The nonstick interior cleans up with paper towels and water and you don't need to put it in the dishwasher which is forbidden anyway. The pan is so heavy that when you preheat it to sear you are able to completely sear a couple of steaks at a time. It's so heavy you could stop a whole band of coyotes with this thing no matter what they'd purchased from the Acme Corporation. It works very well with an induction cooking top too. The handle is bare porcelain enamel and it gets warm so consider buying a silicone handle cover especially if you have a gas range. Last but not least it has spouts for pouring off deglazing liquids to make those great reduction sauces 
I bought this grill to make lefse but so far I have only used it for tortillas and pancakes. It works wonderfully and cooks 4 -5 pancakes or tortillas at a time. I can cook them in less than half the time it took using a skillet on the stove. It has been easy to clean too. Now I all I need to do is find the time to make lefse 
--and I've used a LOT of grinders. VERY badly designed, and the "custom" thing is a gimmick and a sham: it's a standard rotary grinder. They just added flashing lights and extra buttons, and made it look bulkier. Every day was a misery dealing with this thing: it's designed so that you have no choice but to spill grinds all over the place when you use it 
did not grind well and then after about 4 months died. I won't make the mistake of buying a DeLonghi product aging 
This item has broken on a few people, so I will update this review if it breaks. So far I really like it. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it seems a tad tall for no real reason. Otherwise it is great. The grind indicator works well once you get a feel for it, although you can do about as well by looking at the grinds yourself as it is grinding. It is also nice that is has a skinny middle coated with rubber so it is easy to hold without slipping. I guess making the skinny middle part may be why it is a bit tall. The look is realy cool and the wind up cord is great too. Ok, the update: three years later in 2006 this thing is still going strong, despite my dumping boiling water in it to clean it and doing other non-manufacturer-approved stuff to it. Two thumbs up 
I'm giving up on coffee grinders. I had to buy this thing, which didn't last long enough to grind the 39oz. bag of Eight O'Clock beans I bought, because the expensive, super-duper, Cuisinart Grind N' Brew's motor failed. Save your money on both and grind the beans in the supermarkets machine. You'll be richer and happier for it 
The DeLonghi Electric grinder that I purchased is of excellent quality and recomend it highly for not only coffee bean grinding, but for those who grind hot peppers into powder, I found it excellent for both. A definate great buy 
Item worked for 1 minute before breaking. Very difficult to get the correct grind. Definitely an item to keep away from. Am returning as defective 
This is a great grinder and the resulting grounds smell so delicious. The ability to select coarse, regular, and fine grind is absolutely the best feature. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because the cord is a little short 
Just got this a couple of weeks ago. Love the look and quality. For the price, you can't go wrong 
This grill was recommended by Alton Brown of Good Eats (FoodTV). The grill came with explicit care instructions for seasoning the cast iron grills. I have used it a half dozen times now, including adding an after market rotisserie. Fantastic temperature control by raising or lowering the coals, or banking the coals away from the food in the multiple compartments. More surface area than I've ever had before. Very easy ash removal. I recommend getting a vegetable oil spray and coating the cooking surface after each use. Easy to keep seasoned 
This platter is a must have! I use it everytime we have guests! I especially like that the rim of the platter is raised a little, so when I use it as a meat platter for dinner, none of the juice runs off. The way the fruit in the pattern sometimes trickles down into the solid portion of the platter is very unique! I just love it 
i read all the reviews before i bought this knife, some were pretty helpful and some were pretty inaccurate. For one, this knife is not for professionals. I've only learned how to shuck oysters recently. I only know one technique so far - going straight for the hinge. Just work at the hinge a few runs, and once you feel the hinge giving, slow down and ease back on the force, the gently twist and you're in. I haven't tried to slide the knife along the side of the oyster, but i suppose that would work too. also, three comments mentioned that this knife is "wimpy," "garbage," and a "waste of time." I don't really agree with them. I've purposely tried to bend this knife. the only thing that gave is the "pop" of the oyster. It's fairly sturdy, and for under 10 dollars, i don't think I can complain. I recommend this knife, whether amateur of not. cheers and enjoy your meals 
This was my first time using an oyster knife. Following the instructions on the back of the packaging, I was able to pop open the first oyster in less than a minute, and each successive oyster was even faster. The knife slid between the shells easily once I found the right groove. And a side-to-side motion quickly sliced the muscle holding the shells together. The knife never threatened to twist or bend, but then again, using the technique described did not require huge amounts of force. 
This is an excellent knife but not for the amateur. It is designed to open an oyster from the side by sliding it along the side groove along the top and bottom shell. By entering from the side you can cut the abductor muscle and flip the top-shell off. It is not a "top-popper" that is designed to open the oyster from the hinge. However, if you sharpen this knife it can be used for hinge-entry by moving the knife with a side-to-side motion while applying pressure, once an incision is made you can then turn your wrist while rocking and pop the hinge. In any case, shucking is an art that you develop over time. I shuck for a living and anyone (a previous reviewer) who takes 20 minutes to open 36 oysters is not a professional but is laughable. The bottom line is if you don't open oysters on a regular basis, and don't really know how to open an oyster, then get a top popper knife with a thick shaft. But if you know what you are doing or want to learn the slick and easy way to open an oyster, this knife is exceptional and I use it every day 
i bought this oyster knife because i work in alaska and i have to shuck oysters daily i went to use it on the first oyster and it bent it took me over an hour to shuck 6 orders (36 oysters) which normally would take we 20-25 mins so i suggest that you do not buy this knife go to a local kitchen supply store and purchase one from the 
It is preposterous that they would even call this thing an oyster knife. This piece of garbage was literally destroyed after opening one raw oyster. I could see that was going to happen before I even tried it. It's just a flimsy thin piece of sheet metal. Anyone who has shucked raw oysters knows how much torque it takes and how rigid the blade needs to be. Apparently these guys don't know anything about that. Shame on OXO/Good Grips for calling this thing an oyster knife 
I own a total of three oyster knives and this one is by far the best. The tapering at the tip of this knife is the feature I like the best. Also, unlike some broad bladed knives, the narrow blade is easier to insert into the smaller, and yearling, oysters. The handle is not too thin and even allows a decent grip for my wife's smaller hands. The guard could be slightly larger but it's been good enough to save me during the occasional slip 
Superb, Beautiful, Delicate, Excellent Quality, A must have for your Wine Rack..Your special quests will love them 
This is the first time I have ordered with Amazon and I was very pleased. I needed both red and white wine glasses (none of mine matched anymore) for a Holiday party. The reviews have helped me alot in making a decision. They came fast and none were broken. I think they are nice for every day and special events too 
Spiegelau was acquired by Riedel a year or two ago, and is quite similar to the Riedel Vinum glassware, which sits just below Riedel's high end sommelier series. These glasses offer exceptional value. The difference between the Spiegelau and the Riedel is less in the quality of any individual stems--both are well-made, European machine blown crystal--than in the fact that Riedel offers a broader range of glassware specifically designed to enhance wines from particular varietals (e.g., cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir) or from particular appellations (e.g., Burgundy, Bordeaux). If you are simply looking for a basic red wine glass and a basic white wine glass, the Spiegelau will work just fine. However, if you usually just drink Barolo, for example, you might wish to invest a bit more money in a Riedel stem specifically developed to enhance the bouquet and flavors of that appellation. However, the most important thing to know is that these are excellent quality glassware that offer the major advantages of crystal over regular glass, a thin lip and a microscopic pores in the glass that effectively increase surface area, increasing the area from which the bouquet can launch. 
I was looking for white wine glasses within a budget. When these glasses were delivered I was impressed with their quality. The glasses are delicate, without being overly fragile. After pricing other glasses from several sources, I was happy to be able to find a set of six glasses at the price usually found for four glasses of comparable quality 
We have been using Riedel crystal wine glasses (and still do on occasion with the handful that we have left), but I finally decided to buy Spiegelau glasses for our everyday drinking glasses. Because we drink wine and entertain regularly, our collection of Riedel glasses has been diminishing --- although the crystal Riedel's are beautiful glasses (and still used for the right occasions), they are extremely fragile and I have personally destroyed several while simply hand washing them. At any rate, after years of attrition via visiting friends and family, we needed to stock up on new glasses. Because I hate to hand wash dishes, I began to look into the dishwasher-safe glasses from Riedel and Spiegelau for the new replacements. I was going to just buy the dishwasher-safe Riedel glasses (name recognition of course), but I couldn't get over how much better the Spiegelaus were priced. Moreover, all of my favorite restaurants use Spiegelau (and come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Riedels at a restaurant). Therefore, I took the leap and stocked up on the Chardonnay, Cabernet, Riesling, Port and Champagne glasses. I'm really glad that I did --- all of them are terrific! Although not as elegant as the fine crystal versions, these are excellent for everyday use and large dinner parties. I've already bounced one off of a granite countertop and it survived the collision without incident. I've also washed them all in the dishwasher several times and they've come out great. I am very, very happy with this purchase. I'm sure that the comparable dishwasher-safe Riedel glasses are just as nice (possibly nicer?), but you can't beat Spiegelau's price! 
I have enjoyed wine served in Spiegelau stemware at several of my favorite restaurants, so I decided to give them a try. For the price, these are really amazing. The glass is nice and thin and the bowls are well-shaped. I now own several dozen of the Bordeaux and Burgundy in addition to the Chardonnay. One glass in one shipment had a broken stem, but Amazon sent me a replacement set via second-day air immediately, before I even had a chance to get to the post office and return the broken one. Pottery Barrel sells glasses of significantly inferior quality for a lot more money 
After using Riedel wine glass for many years, and breaking many of them with a flick of my wrist; I decided to go with the better priced spiegelau's. They are great! My wine collector husband, who had previously only wanted to have the Reidel's; loves them too! If you drink lots of wine and want a high quality glass to enjoy it in, these are it 
I've had endless trouble finding good quality but affordable deep-pocket sheets for my queen size mattress. I just added a 3" memory foam pad, making the job even more difficult. I saw these sheets and was amazed at the price, so I thought I'd give them a try. I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality! Soft and solky, with a perfect fit. They have the look and feel of a much more expensive product. 
I was so impressed with these sheets, I immediately ordered a second set. I recently purchased a pillowtop mattress and had to replace all my bed linens to accomodate the deep pockets needed. Out of the 5 sets I purchased, these are the BEST...outranking the Sealy sheets I bought @ $110.00 per set. Obviously, I wish I'd found these first. Outstanding fit, comfort and quality 
Product was great and was just what I ordered. Would use the site again 
I have 2 of these mugs in plum. They are the perfect size for cereal, soup and hot chocolat 
These are the best cups they are really large, and very heavy/sturdy. I love the colors too (this is my favorite of the colors 
Jumbo is right. These cups are perfect for morning Joe, especially when you have houseguests and you want to fill up once and then sit and talk all morning 
I love Fiestaware, and I enjoy the cobalt more than any other color. These Jumbo Cups are lovely and match the rest of my cobalt Fiestaware completely. They are large enough to hold a great amount of tea. My only disappointment is that they come just shy of holding an entire standard can of soup. If you do not remove about four tablespoons worth of soup before cooking in the microwave, the soup will spill. If the cups had been just a little larger, I wouldn't have to worry about wasting soup. Otherwise, they are fantastic 
These mugs hold 16 ounces if filled to the brim, rather than the advertised 18 ounces. It is irksome, because I bought a set of these to replace an old set of 18 ounce Gibson ceramic mugs that we use for everything from cereal to soup. The Fiesta mugs are well made, colorful, and easy to handle. I will keep them because the Gibson mugs don't seem to be made anymore. I would rate the mugs 5 stars, but my huband is going to gripe about the smaller size. Sigh 
I have a schnauzer (they have an undercoat). This is the first grooming tool, I have found that detangles his undercoat. If you are wondering if you should make this purchase, go ahead, you will be glad you did. This is an excellent product, which was delivered sooner than expected 
This brush may not look much at first, but the effectiveness cannot be overstated. I have a long hair husky that we brushed regularly and didn't think much of it until I got this brush. Even without the knot cutter (the long bladed edge), the rake itself is so functional that the first day we removed another bucket hair that we didn't even know was there. I am an online shopaholic, and she said this is the best $10 I spent 
I am so pleased with this product. It does an incredible job on our Great Pyrenees coat and mats, the only problem we had was it broke on our first use. We did superglue it back together, and now it works like a charm. We love it 
Works better than other undercoat tools that cost MUCH more 
Until we bought this tool, we never had an effective comb that would remove our dogs undercoat. It has helped to reduce the amount of dog hair we clean up, especially in the spring when out dog begins to shed 
I can't imagine a better deal for a brightly lighted dog leash! It arrived quickly and works better than I expected. Great product at an unbelievable price! I plan to order more for gifts and back-up leashes for my dog! 
This leash is different with lights for walking your dog in the dark 
I purchased a dozen of these after I recieved my first two! These are the most beautifully crafted leashes in the world! They look so k3wl when walking your dog at night and all my neighbors are in love with them and always are amazed at how they llok! They blink red/blue/white back and forth and shine brightly at night and can be seenn down the street. I sewar my dogs now love going for walks even more now once they see me fire up the leashes as they know everyone that sees them compliments them and gives the dogs attention 
I got the dog leash for a friend in a quick and fast manner 
This is a great item for any night walker. Blight enough for car drivers to notice you are crossing the street. I don't recommend the blinking type. Those are very annoying. I highly recommend the one with solid light. I've tried the glow in the dark leash. The light stop glowing before I could finish the walk. Worst part is, they are double the price of the much better Atomic leash. 5 stars 
My Rottie just LOVES her bolster corner bed. At the end of last year she was operated on both hips for dysplasia and just couldn't find a comfortable spot in the house to lie down. Everytime she'd turn over onto her back, she'd complain. After I got her this bed, all complaints ended and I'm sure it helped her a lot in her recuperation. Whenever she's in the house, she's on her bed, most of the time all four paws in the air. I really don't know how she'd be today if I hadn't gotten this bed for her. On the technical side, I'd say it's very well made with good quality materials. I just pass the vacuum over it weekly to pick up loose hairs and hang it outside every 2 weeks to air it a bit. Other than that, I haven't had to do anything to it yet. Great product! 
Our German Shepherd LOVES this big comfy corner bed. It is big enough for her to stretch out and fluffs up easily to make a very soft spot to curl up in. The bolster is firm enough to support her if she lays against it or props her head up on it. It does not show her white hair that stands out on every other piece of furniture in the house and it washes well. The neutral color that we picked also does not draw attention to it in our bedroom. I would definitely purchase this bed again if I ever need one. 
I love this line of cookware. I strategically waited for these to go on sale and get free shipping. I bought this as a B-day present for myself 
This is my third Calphalon purchase, and is a fantastic value for its low price. I've steamed seafood, braised pot roast, and simmered chicken soup in it. Undoubtedley the most versatile cookware item I've ever owned. It is sturdy, easy to clean, and the bottom disk holds and distributes the heat well.  
found this to be very useful... I make cheesecakes often once they're chilled, I had a problem finding something large enough to accomodate a 10 cheesecake to another plate.... VOILA!!!!! this works wonderful... 
I wish I read the bad review before I bought this. I may return it, but it took me more than an hour to peel the sticker and cut myself in the process. I have never seen something stuck like that before. I got four items from Amazon this time, and the fact that they keep such an item in stock make me wonder. I haven't had enough experience with it but look like someone else had. And it is not good. Also it is a very simple utensil and sells for a good amount so you expect a good one. All what it takes is one bad experience for me and I don't buy again from the same site 
I bought this product from a small retail shop in my hometown recently. I found this product to be very useful when removing a frozen pizza from the oven, that I make once a week or so for my kids. It is a unique idea 
These clips are great for displaying my kids' artwork and posting their chore charts. Only problem -- my 34 yr olds love them too. They keep disappearing off my fridge 
In other words, I can't understand why the two "Spotlight" reviews are negative. My kettle has been used several times a day for years now, and has only just conked out. It boils water extremely quickly because the heating coil is in direct contact with the water; it boils precise amounts and shuts off automatically, which saves time and electricity; and the snap sound when it shuts off is infinitely preferable to the screech of a traditional boiling kettle. My only criticism relates to looks: having lived in England where there is a lot of choice and the kettles are both shapelier and more colorful, I find the Bodum rather a bore to look at. But it does the job: hence the full five stars 
I first used one of these in my hotel room in London. It heats water fast and is easy to clean up. The unit sits on a stationary power base so you don't have to keep plugging it in all of the time. I just love it and highly recommend one to all of my friends. I've bought several now as gifts and everyone comments on how they threw out their stove top water kettle after using this one. Highly recommended. If you French Press Coffee or Drink Tea, Buy One 
I've used one of these for almost a year now and I find it perfect for my needs. Heats up a big mugful of water nice and quick, and that's all I need. It has been very reliable. I suppose if I tried to use it many times in a row without letting it cool down, it might have problems as others here have described, but by the time I'm finished drinking a big cup of tea, and am ready for more, it's ready for service. The manual does say it can be switched on as soon as the thermal elements have cooled, but in defense of these other customers, that doesn't clearly give an idea of how long one should wait. Anyway, I'm very happy with mine and wouldn't hesitate to suggest this product to others 
I like the kettle. I use it in the office with water from a filter pitcher. It boils the water fast and automatic switch off makes it very convenient. The only set back: you have to wiggle to close the lid. It would be nice to have a water level indicator/clear window. 
I have both the mini full-sized kettles, I use the mini size @ work the full-size @ home (all electric high-rise). They last a long, long time as long as you use them properly (fill to cover coil especially important). One thing to note, I try to use either warm or hot water when boiling to speed up the heating process (but hardly a slow kettle to begin with). Also, bottled/filtered water results in less mineral deposits on the coil further prolongs the life 
I bought this product to make hot water for tea and coffee (in a french press) in my cube at work. I've only had it for a few days but so far so good. I am, however, a bit concerned about some of the reports of this unit burning out after a period of time. I guess time will tell... Some things to note about this kettle: 1) It seems to take a while for the water to come to a boil compared to some of the other electric kettles that I've used. I should note that it may hold more water which would be a valid explanation. After the first boil water does stay warm for some time making reheats pretty quick. 2) The handle design on this thing is horrible using a square design instead of a curved found on many other kettles. I'm surprised that such a poor design has come from Bodum. This makes the long walk from the kitchen to my cube with a full kettle a bit awkward. It also makes it a bit uncomfortable to pour from a full pot. In all, it's not a real deal breake 
I have owned this kettle for several days, and it is somewhat quiet. The water boils relatively fast. I like the lid, which makes it easy to put water in from the faucet. I have not had any problems with the kettle yet. I would recommend this kettle 
This is a great product - very basic, but does the job (boiling water) qite efficiently. It's also easy to store in a cupboard. I like the european design. Make sure you order the correct size, because this water kettle comes in two sizes. Water boils FAST 
Boils water faster than the microwave oven. Very handy when you want a quick cup of tea. Great price, too 
I love this pot. It fits easily in my suitcase to boil water anywhere I go. Great for quick instant coffee, tea, soup, noodles. I usually buy a new one every year because I depend so heavily on it. I love the colors, my next one will be purchased on Amazon 
I have had this machine for about a month now, I love it! I have had other slightly lower end espresso machines (pump driven, $250 range) and after repeated issues I felt it was time to upgrade. I drink cappuccino every morning, the espresso from this machine is fantastic and the frother is both easy to use and clean. I just got back from a trip to Italy and the cappuccino I make with this rivals anything I had on vacation. Assuming this machine holds up long term, it is well worth the money 
Probably the single most important investment I have made this year! Delivers deeply satisfying espresso with rich crema every time. I have used the more expensive manual pump machines and the fully automatics--the Gaggia Classic delivers as good or better than those more expensive machines. And, it's built like a tank--very sturdy construction, feels and acts industrial grade, and looks great in the kitchen. Fits under kitchen cabinets nicely. had it for a month and I am completely sold! Oh, and I have not been to Starbucks once...no comparison. 
After much research we were down to the Gaggia Classic vs the Rancilio Silvia. The Gaggia won out for two reasons: a) 20% discount from BB b) Most reviews on the Silvia mentioned finickey coffee grind issues. THE PROS: We just received this machine today (12/21/06). We got an AWESOME cup of coffee right out of the box! If you follow the directions you will too. THE CONS: The plastic parts. Although I can understand they make for easy cleaning (the water tank and the drip tray) they seem to be made of inferior plastic. We will not be using the frothing device except for dispensing hot water. But that too seems to be a flimsy plastic device. I still highly recommend this product as a step up from steam machines. It's also a nice looking design and will look good on the counter 
When I got my Gaggia more than several decades ago, it was not yet called a Classic. It was called a Coffee Gaggia. About 20 years ago, some minor changes were made, and the unit was renamed Classic. The new "Coffee Gaggia" is not the same as this machine. This machine has a robust build, and high quality parts. Its tank heats the water quickly, and to a proper temperature, and the pump is powerful enough to do the job properly. I would strongly recommend using filtered water, especially with a low mineral content, so that deposits do not build up in the tank. My version has an all metal frothing wand, which does as good a job as the skills of the operator will allow for. The newer versions have a "turbo frother," and an optional milk frother that will take the guess work out of frothing and place foamed milk directly into the cup. I can't comment on these newer features, but perhaps they will allow a better job to be done by those with less experience. The newer models are brushed stainless, while the original models had an appliance enamel finish. Since the old finish allowed water to penetrate under any scratches or imperfections in the finish, this was a particular problem near the portafilter holder and underneath the drip tray. The new version should retain its finish far longer, although the old one still does not show any wear in places that are visible with the machine assembled. Minor differences are that the new machine has a more robust looking steam knob that was moved to the side, and the thermostat light, which indicated that the unit was heating, has been replaced with a "ready" light that is integrated into the coffee switch and signals the opposite. In the time that I've had my machine, I've had only minor problems with it. My steam thermostat needed to be replaced once, and the light on my power switch stopped working. These were larger issues before the Internet made it easy to find parts, as these items are hard to find locally. The other problem is that if the unit is not used for extended periods, and the tank is allowed to dry out completely, and the water used was hard, then some parts are subject to clogging. The troubleshooting steps in the manual are not helpful for these sorts of problems. The machine can be disassembled for cleaning by somebody who is mechanically inclined, but unless you feel comfortable with appliance repair, you are better off avoiding the situation by using filtered water, and/or descaling regularly, especially before any long term storage. The other "parts" issue is that the gasket for the filter basket should be considered a consumable part, and should be sold by every dealer as an accessory, rather than just by repair facilities. The machine really should have included an extra one since this is the only part that will definitely wear out with regular use. It might take a few years or longer, and is easy to replace, but it will wear out. Overall, this is a well built machine that should last you many decades. Although it seemed expensive when I bought it, it has averaged out to about 6 cents a day to own it, which was well worth the price, and I'll probably get another few decades out of it. If you have used cheaper espresso makers, you will appreciate the robustness and quality of this unit. Features such as the three way solenoid controlled valve might be transparent to the user, but the lack of them become clear when you use a cheaper machine. This one just keeps going and going. 
For the price, I'd give the espresso making part of this machine 5 stars. The portafilter and brew group are substantial and well-made. I've worked at two espresso shops with commercial machines, and the parts on this moderately priced Gaggia are nearly as heavy and substantial as the big multiple-thousands of dollars machines. I've had the machine for 4 days and have been brewing shots with Starbuck$ pods. The toggle switches are easy to use, the reservoir is easy to fill, and the shots are aromatic and full of crema every time. However, the steaming wand takes a star away from this machine. It does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced Starbucks machine. This makes it hard to remove a cup full of frothed milk from under the wand without spilling. Also, the plastic frother contraption is silly. Actual frothing capability is pretty good, though the plain metal tips on the commercial machines produced finer microfroth, and were more fine-tuned to the trained barista's hand. Overall, it's a good-looking machine, and I'm satisfied with it for my main purposes - iced lattes and americanos, and straight double shots, all of which do not require use of the steaming attachment. This is a good entry-level machine that will brew you good shots, and look good on your countertop. However, I'm expecting to outgrow it and move up to an Isomac with more refined steaming capability within a few years 
The machine produces an extremely wonderful cup of espresso. It's main and constantly irritating flaw is this turbo frother sleeve. It has too many pieces to clean, and worst of all, the sleeve does not remain securely attached to the the metal steam pipe. Several times I've had the frother explode off the machine in a cloud burst of half-steamed milk that sprayed all over the kitchen. I've had various other problems with this complicated design. In fact, the company provides a detailed, additional page of instructions on how to troubleshoot with the frother sleeve, which suggests to me that the company is already aware that the design is flawed. I have to ask the question: why not produce a simple, metal frother that doesn't break and require such special care? This is the second Gaggia machine that I have purchased this year (the previous was a full automatic with a faulty sensor), and this is the second Gaggia that has left me disappointed. I agree that the espresso quality is very good - but I remain underwhelmed for the prices I've paid, given the design flaws I've encountered 
I just bought a Gaggia Classic after extensively reading online about which machines were the best pick (thanks to N. Caine for his excellent reviews and suggestions - you made the choice a lot easier). After much research, I chose the Gaggia Classic and I'm glad that I did. This machine is very impressive: sturdy housing, 3 way solenoid valve and crema laden expresso that's liquid gold. It's easy to use and clean up is also a breeze. Although I looked at the Gaggia Carezza as a possible candidate, I was turned off by the plastic housing and the lack of the solenoid valve. The Gaggia Classic is worth the extra money and is a pleasure to use. I highly recommend this machine for anyone who is looking to upgrade from otherwise disappointing machines such as Krups or Delonghi. Look no further: the Gaggia doesn't disappoint 
This was a nicely made block, with very good fit and finish. Good variety of spaces for a wide variety of knife sizes. As was noted by another reviewer, the slot for kitchen shears is small - only about 2" of the blades fit in the hole. Still, if in the market again for this, I would re-purchase 
Plenty of room for all knifes of all shapes and lengths. Good construction. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the kitchen shear slot. To small 
Even though I am a fan of the Calphalon cutlery line (I really think they beat the pants off of the German competition), this block leaves a lot to be desired. The block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice, and I ordered this block to house the additional knives that I bought. It appears to be the same design, but the quality control is awfull. Several glue joints were split open when I recieved the block, and the finish was not quite up to par. Given the low cost, I chose to glue and clamp the block into submission, rather than to send it back, but you might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with 
I love that there is nothing to clean. The tray is non stick, so the pizza just slides right off. There are no coils and metal trays to clean off. We LOVE this pizza maker!! 
I bought this for work so I could eat non-microwaved food for once. It works as intended and very handy. I might buy one for home. 
We bought this for my sons family as a Christmas Gift and they totally love it, it works just as stated so when they are in a hurry they just take out a frozen 12" pizza and put it on the Pizzazz Pizza Oven and in minutes the pizza is hot and ready to eat. 
Being able to cook the top and bottom separately is what makes this a great product 
Not sure if I would spend the money on this myself, but my roommate has one and we both use it all the time for those cheap frozen pizzas. Once you figure out how long to cook each pizza type, its a breeze to throw a pizza on there and set the timer. The pizzas come out with a nice crispy crust but not overcooked toppings, and this can be further controlled by changing which element is on. It is fairly easy to clean. If you more often buy more expensive and thicker/larger frozen pizzas, it may be more difficult to get them to come out correctly with this device. (Big-chain store deli pizzas come to mind) I was surprised to see this or a similar machine on BoingBoing as a recent news item when we have owned this for over a year now 
We've had the Pizzazz for about 5 years and its incredible, we use it for just about anything frozen. Don't think twice about buying one 
Is this a fast and easy way to take a pizza from freezer to perfect in minutes? The product features are not clear 
I was concerned about dead counter space when buying this item. I was very wrong!! You cannot go wrong with this item as it does not require preheating the oven + it cooks pizza an average of 4 minutes quicker than the oven. The Pizzas taste better because they are evenly heated. (this is my first Amazon rating after being a consumer for over 5 years 
the pizzazz pizza oven works like no regular oven can. i recommend this product highly 
Hands down, this is an all time fav of mine. It is great for family use 
This is our third Floormate in about 10 years. The only complaint I have about it is that the lifespan of the machine only seems to be about 3 years. All three of our Floormates stopped suctioning up the water, and we could never seem to fix the problem. We ended up just buying a new one. That said, the Floormate is a terrific cleaner. We have tile floors, six dogs, and eight cats - all indoor animals - two with cronic health problems. Needless to say, someone is always throwing up, peeing, or pooping. We use the Floormate on a daily basis and have never had a problem with it cleaning properly until it get old and stops vacuuming up the dirty water 
I bought this last night and immediately tried it when I got home on my filthy kitchen floor. I am so pleased, I can't wait to use it again. It was quick, easy, a back saver and the floor dried almost instantly. The best thing is that you're not pushing dirty water around on the floor. I would highly recommend this product 
I really like my Floormate. I've been using it for about 2 years now and would never go back to mopping with dirty water again. I have 3000 square feet of ceramic tile and 3 big dogs who drool a lot, not to mention that they track dirt in from outside. This machine gets the dirt right up, but the drool has to be gone over 4 or 5 times before the spot is completely gone. I noticed that a lot of other reviewers stated that they didn't like the cost or cleaning abilitly of the recommended Hoover cleaning solution. I didn't care for it either. I use cheap Fabuloso ($[...] or so per bottle) and it works just fine. I have used Lysol and other mopping liquids in the past. They all did just fine in my machine. I know the manufacturer says not to use anything but their product, but I do it anyway. I mop once a week and my machine is 2 years old. I guess the cheap cleaner is just fine. I also fill the tank with very hot water....I think that helps loosen the dirt on the floor. Overall this is a great product. I probably wouldn't be as happy with it if I had to use the Hoover floor cleaning solution. I thought that was awful 
Let me describe my floors... I turn 30 tomorrow. I'm a bachelor with a dog and cat. I'm also an avid (messy) cook and I bought the Hoover for my kitchen. The floor is a lightly textured vinyl. My main hobby is brewing beer which tends to leave lots of sticky wort and beer on the floor. Another side-effect is that lots of drunken people parade through my kitchen which is between my bar and the bathroom. It's also winter time and I've been putting a sand salt mix on the walkways. In summary, my floors are disgusting!! I read the instructions today at work and I couldn't wait to get home and try my floor mate. It assembled quickly and easily. I used the dry setting first and it actually impressed me. I was planning on using my normal vacuum, but I was too lazy to get it out. It was also a lot quieter than my vacuum (a kenmore model) I set the hoover up for wet mode. It did what it promised- it put down the liquid, scrubbed, and sucked it up. At first, I didn't think it was sucking up the wetness as much as I would have hoped; but as I was rinsing out the floor mate (which was quick and easy), I turned around to find 90% of the floor was already bone dry. As I was cleaning out the wet container- wow! The water was jet black with dirt. Well, it's taken me a few minutes to write this, so let me check on the results... The floor is 99.99% dry and immaculate! It hasn't been that clean, since... well, ever! I have one complaint- the container you put the solution in could be bigger. I ran out just before finishing the kitchen (and it's pretty small). Luckily the brushes were wet enough to finish the job. I love my floor mate! Thank you Hoover! For all the writers of the bad reviews- I think you need to read your manual. 
I bought this machine because I HATE to mop, I have a bad back and mopping will leave me useless for the rest of the day. I used this machine on my linoleum floors in my kitchen, WHAT A LIFESAVER. Not only was it easy to use but got up even the most caked on dirt near the front door. When I was done the floor was clean, DRY, and I didn't have the back pain that I'd come to associate with a clean floor 
I've used my Floor Mate over two years on my hard wood floors and I've only used a light mix of Shaklee Basic H and water. Yes it can leave some water streaks if you go too fast, so move slowly and your floors are sparkling clean and dry 
The machine leaves water at the grout line, I ha use a mop to clean the floor after using the floormate. I have stopped using this. I hope someone makes a machine to clean til 
I bought this so I could easily bake small items without having to heat up a regular oven, and because my trusty toaster finally bit the dust. I can not get the lower heating elements to work, so toasting takes twice as long because you have to flip it over. I baked a small batch of cookies that would have turned out great except I had the tray in the wrong position (too high to the upper elements) and the tops were burned. Bagel Bites I cook for my kids come out ok, not crisp on the bottom, but that makes it easier for my girls to eat. I tried baking a small loaf of banana bread today and it looked beautiful, until I turned the loaf out to cool. It was completely raw on the bottom. I ended up turning it over in the pan and cooking it again, and it came out fine after that. My comment is "why have the lower heating elements if they never turn on?!?" I have read the manual over and over and can't find anything that tells me about the lower elements. I sent an email to DeLonghi, but I doubt I'll get anything useful back from them. Don't waste your money on this. On the other hand, it sure is pretty, but that's not what counts in my book. 
We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the "Always On" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames. You were warned. Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product. Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse 
This machine is an accident waiting to happen. In order to pull out the (very hot) toasting rack, you have to attach a separate handle. Not only is this awkward and inconvenient, we found after many attempts to attach the handle safely, we were unable to do so, since it attaches at an angle that requires on's hand to come very near to or actually touch the EXTREMELY HOT frame of the oven. Avoid this item at all costs 
We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the lsat time I buy a toaster based on appearance 
I owned two DeLonghi's previously and after a brief affair with a Cuisinart TOB-30 I am back for good. None of these ovens are perfect but the DeLonghi does more things right than anything else on the market. First, let me address some comments of the previous reviewers. Yes, the timer is a little weird. But it is like the ignition system on a Saab, a little quirk that you put up with in light of the rest of the machine. The earlier reviewer misspoke when saying you could only bake by cylcling through the timer in 4-minute intervals. They didn't know how to work it properly. You just turn the dial to the LEFT to the ON position and it stays on as long as you like. (The windup timer is primarily for toasting.) The timer is noisy and sounds old fashioned, which is the main reason I tried the Cuisinart with an electronic timer system. Guess what? -It broke in less than six months in a smoky and dangerous fog. The wind up timers on my DeLonghi's have all lasted about ten years... Two previous reviewers also commented on the door hitting the counter. Funny, when I got the Cuisinart I thought it was strange that the door didn't hit the counter. I believe DeLonghi does this intentionally so the toaster oven won't tip if you need to rest a hot and heavy pan on the open door. If you are like me and keep stuff on top of the oven that you're not supposed to, the firmly anchored door will prevent that stuff from flying into your Mac Cheese, as happened with me on the less stable Cuisinart. The oven comes with a heavy enameled broiling pan and tray, which seems a miracle given the low price. The wire shelf doesn't need to be re-positioned constantly like the Cuisinarts, but when needed it slides in and out easily. Because I still think the timer could be better designed and the new looks don't compare to the discontinued classic Alfredo (white oven with clean round red dials) I'll rate it a 4 instead of a 5. But for baking, broiling, and toasting this oven is still the best. It will come closer to cooking food like a full sized oven than anything near its price.
