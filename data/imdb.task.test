1	this film is a masterpiece to put it simply .  especially the double exposure made by the cameraman julius jaenzon .  it is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later .  viktor sjöström ,  the director ,  also plays the main character ,  david holm .  on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight ,  and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year ,  will have to work as a soul-collector in the form of a transparent ghost .  there is a new soul-collector to be appointed every year .   the scene in which the alcoholic ,  david holm ,  rises up from his dead body  ( like the soul is leaving his earthly body )  in the churchyard  ( where the fight took place )  is a real award for a filmloving eye .  also when the present soul-collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene .  david holm recognizes this soul-collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life .  it is now his turn to take over .  just like scrooge in dickens story  " a christmas tale "  ,  david is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him .   the film is about the danger of abusing drugs ,  in this case alcohol .  it is based upon a book by nobel prize winner selma lagerlöf .  viktor sjöström filmed a few more of her books ,  but this is the one with the best outcome ,  maybe because this book is the most filmic of them .   
0	this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible .  the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen .   normally i don't write reviews ,  but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got .  while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts ,  the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting .  the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it ,  introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made ,  judging by the trailer .  we were not disappointed in the least .  its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line :   brandon :  i just want to get to know you .   girl :  you just want to get into my pants .   brandon :  i want to get into your mind ,  your heart ,  your soul .  i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation .   overall ,  i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously . 
0	that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising .  in our post-enron era ,  do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed ?  the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort ,  but will respond with barely concealed rage .  it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces .   what's really irksome with these kinds of films ,  including  " purpose "  ,  is their pretense that behind the glitter ,  there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile .  in  " purpose "  ,  i found no such meaningful message .  what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth .  the two main characters ,  nauseating in their glibness ,  do very little actual work .  instead ,  they party ,  they play golf ,  they strut their coolness ,  they sound  " hip "  with dialogue straight out of mtv-culture-speak :   " rock my world "  ,  and  " now get back to partying ;  that's an order "  .  john is smug ,  self-important ,  shallow ,  and smirks a lot .  robert ,  who wears funky little glasses ,  is even worse .   the film includes two youthful garage geeks ,  who look and sound like they're right out of the film  " antitrust "   ( 2001 )  .  stereotypes are played for all they're worth ,  and in this film also include chic-looking computer equipment ,  and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can-do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-duty partying .  and with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates ,  can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years ?   about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco .  the film would have been a lot more enjoyable ,  a lot more entertaining ,  if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story ,  and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration . 
0	this  " film ,  "  and i use that term loosely ,  reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote ,  at eighteen months :   " p . u .  ,  stinky poopies !  "    like that joke ,  this movie can only appeal to the very young ,  the very immature ,  or the very stupid .    that said ,  there are a few bright spots .    the effects ,  where the majority of the reputed $100 million went ,  are kinetic and convincing -- i mean ,  as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be .  the cgi baby effects are not great ,  but i imagine those are very hard to do well .  .  .  although for a hundred-million bucks ,  they could have been better !   moose ,  the dog from  " frasier ,  "  phoned in his usual exemplary performance .  steven wright did well with a small part .  alan cummings was ,  well ,  alan cummings-as-villain ,  which we've seen before ,  and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable ,  but enjoyable .    the actress playing mrs .  avery was cute-as-a-button ,  as you'd expect ,  and jamie kennedy stunk ,  as you'd expect .  his best role so far was in the scream trilogy  ( not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy )  ,  and in three kings .  he should stick ,  perhaps ,  to more subtle forms of comedy .  jim carrey ,  he ain't .   the writing and direction were ,  if anything ,  worse than kennedy's performance .  i semi-remember one clever  ( though seven-year-old clever )  line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the  " memorable quotes "  section .  something about avery's proposed costume being the  " crappiest crap in craptown ,  "  it was a second-grade joke ,  but sort of funny in context .   over all ,  since there's nothing lower than a  " one ,  "  i give this film a  " one .  " 
0	the plot for black mama white mama ,  revolves around two female inmates ,  at a women's prison in the phillipines .  one black ,  and one white .  these two women ,  are thrown together in the prison .  pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison ,  for dancing as a harem girl .    lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits ,  from his drug-dealing activities .  lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money ,  so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life .  margaret markov plays karen brent ,  a white women from a privileged background ,  who is also a revolutionary .  karen has joined a group of revolutionaries ,  determined to change the corrupt phillipino political system .  she's captured by phillipino authorities ,  and held as a political prisoner .   the story-line takes-off ,  when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together .  the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist .  as they flee ,  they also fight with each other ,  because they have different goals to pursue .  naturally ,  they hate being chained together .  but they also realize that they must put aside their differences ,  to help each other survive while they evade capture .   if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage ,  it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same ,  as well as their location in the phillipines .  roger corman ,  has always had a consistent stable of actors ,  that he used in all of his 70s b movies .  besides pam grier ,  sid haig ,  roberta collins ,  claudia jennings ,  betty anne rees ,  and william smith ,  were also among the many actors that were frequently cast ,  in corman's aip films .   like the big bird cage ,  black mama white mama ,  relies on too much gory violence to be palatable .  pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film ,  and shows her competence as a female action heroine .  margaret markov is less effect ,  in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen .  she just seems to fragile and well-coiffed ,  to be a dedicated political guerrilla .  except for sid haig ,  as the colorful ruben ,  the rest of the cast is forgettable .   this film has little entertainment value ,  unless excessive ,  heinous acts of violence are your thing .  only the performances by pam grier and sig haig ,  make this film worth watching . 
1	this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why .   ( a few spoilers - but for the ending ,  you'll have to watch the movie !  )  a simple story - in moscow on the eve of war between russia and germany in ww ii veronika  ( tatiana samoilova )  is in love with boris  ( aleksei batalov )  but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army .  boris leaves for the front before veronika can tell him she loves him .  boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to veronika or his family .  mark ,  boris' cousin ,  rapes veronika who feels obligated to marry him .  degraded and demeaned by the cowardly mark ,  veronika clings to the hope that someday boris will return .  superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director kalatozov .   ( for anyone interested in film technique another movie by kalatozov ,  i am cuba ,  has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of havana ,  rises two stories to a cigar factory ,  tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long ,  long avenue - all without a cut .  )  superb acting ,  particularly by samoilova and vasili merkuryev  ( as boris' uncle )  that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement .  a devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by samoilova .   ( this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic ballad of a soldier .  ) 
0	supposedly ,  a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie ,  a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense .  it's all a crock ,  some kind of money making racket .   turns out this movie is actually a deceit ,  and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos ,  one i've heard before .  this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology .  the paranormal ?  it's real ,  just demonic ,  unless it takes place in a christian context ,  then of course ,  it is of god .  simple ,  if it isn't of god ,  it's the of the devil ,  stupid !  so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god ,  it must have been written under demonic influence .  or so would the logic lead ad absurdum .   we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe ,  therefore there is none  ( a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy )  and that god created the universe so huge ,  so grand to show us his almighty power .  i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space .   so what are ufos ?  they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event ,  the rupture .  .  . i mean rapture .  before the tribulation ,  the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic ,  confusion ,  car and plane crashes .  .  . whatever .  therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event .  all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist .   this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another ,  in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown ,  the strange ,  and the mysterious in as much as possible ,  first by the known ,  if not solely by the known .   it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for .  i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away ,  gotten lost ,  or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens ,  or the supernatural or satan or some such .   this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new ,  as young people are often lured to free rock concerts ,  that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music ,  followed by a sermon and an altar call .  this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame .  but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes ,  these guys feel that anything goes ,  any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive ,  which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam ,  the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity ,  as islam is far more cohesive and unified ,  and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism .  although this should offer little advantage to mankind ,  as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another .   and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal's wager .  the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told .  well ,  if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave ,  no worry .  .  . but what if you're wrong ?   basically ,  statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy ,  is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy .  even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default ,  nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology ,  that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default .   for all we know ,  native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better .   this movie should be stamped right on the box :  caution :  contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes . 
0	admittedly ,  you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci-fi ,  and thats enough to get me interested ,  so if you are like that ,  black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it .  the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch .   the movie plays like the naked gun series ,  spoofing cop dramas with bad clichés and bad acting .  unfortunately ,  i don't think they meant to be funny ,  the actors really are made of cardboard ,  the dialog really does suck ,  so well just have to laugh at them ,  and not with them .   on a side note ,  it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space ,  half on earth ,  and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events .  i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors . 
1	a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business .  it's easy watching ,  and even offers blethyn & molina stealing a scene from an old fred & ginger movie .  walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of molina in the undertaking business ,  trying to bring a new style to an old welsh town .  we see a couple of very funny examples of the  " new style "  .  the plot thickens with pugh having an affair with watts ,  and her suggesting that they do blethyn in .  meanwhile molina has rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for blethyn ,  and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south seas ,  and dance away their days together .  during the  " fake "  funeral blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge .  watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be--a celebration of life ! 
0	i have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life !  as stated in other commentaries ,  a who's who of talent ,  such as ,  christopher plummer ,  faye dunaway ,  donald sutherland ,  and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an agatha christie story .  i keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast ,  done the right way .    the film has even less intimacy than the christopher reeves 'superman' movies .  the large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films ,  because there is not enough time to get to know anyone .  dave brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store .  the music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed .  it's hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes ,  was more offensive .  from someone who has seen most christie films  ( that's what attracted me to this ,  it was one of the few i hadn't seen )  miss this one .  it is not an agatha christie movie .  golan-globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling ,  rather than the snug atmosphere of english mystery . 
1	the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s .  ephata merkerson .  ms .  merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny ,  the woman who believes in doing good ,  no matter to whom ,  with no strings attached .  this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing .   thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together .  this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place .   of course ,  none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn't written his wonderful play .  working with mr .  wolf ,  perhaps the best theater director of this generation ,  they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms .  crosby ,  when his own parents are not around to take care of him .  ms .  crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben ;  in a way ,  he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter .   unfortunately ,  there is no time to develop some of the characters ,  as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben ,  played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin ,  who is a natural .  the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive ,  as it doesn't clarify ,  or justify what one is seeing .  frankly ,  just by watching the interaction of the players ,  is self explanatory .   in the background there is always music .  no matter what hard times these people are going through ,  but nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era .   aside from ms .  merkerson ,  other notable performances are given by terrence dashon howard ,  one of the rising stars of the moment .  mos def ,  jeffrey wright ,  marcy gray ,  louis gossett jr .  , delroy lindo ,  rosie perez ,  carmen ejogo ,  jimmy smits and the rest .   ms .  s .  ephata merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience .  in  " lackawanna blues "  ,  she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma . 
1	like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down ,  so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity .  donna reed is a case in point .   i don't think donna reed ever thought that donna stone was anything challenging ,  not to a woman who had won an oscar for playing a very different type in from here to eternity .  she was certainly better prepared to play wife ,  mother ,  and homemaker donna stone after having played mary bailey in it's a wonderful life .    donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband .  carl betz was not an idiot ,  he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house .  talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis .   though this was the donna reed show because donna's husband at the time ,  tony owen produced it .  yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children ,  shelley fabares and paul petersen .  fabares had that best selling teen record johnny angel which she introduced on the show .  she successfully made the transition to adult star ,  most known for her role in coach as craig t .  nelson's wife .   but petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day .  the donna reed show dare i say got most of its viewers because of him .  it's forgotten now ,  but petersen also had a best selling record ,  my dad .  didn't do half as well as johnny angel .    now paul petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself .  so many of them end so tragically ,  it's good work that he's doing .    the stone family was the quintessence of middle america .  they lived in a suburb near chicago ,  they led wholesome lives .  mom and dad were always there for the kids .  of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew .    it's this series i believe was the model for the tv town of pleasantville where tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are sucked into .    i have pleasant memories of the donna reed show .  easy to take ,  but not too seriously . 
1	i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made .  when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie .  i'd read about the highland team in the newspapers ,  but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me .   last night i viewed it  " on-demand "  and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies .  ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job .  neil mcdonough was especially convincing .  as the  " bad dad "  he displayed fine range and a subtle ,  but moving character arc .   i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors .  i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture .  a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of highland's team would have been a excellent addition to the film .   some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently .  it's good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state . 
0	i picked out this dvd out of the cheepo bin at walmart because the cover showed one of the planes i flew during viet-nam  ( c-123k )  .  i did not fly for air america ,  but knew being a c-123 pilot ,  i knew a lot who did ,  including those who flew in my reserve unit back home .  i am not a movie critic ,  but wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this .  the best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman .  the flying shots and stunts  ( although totally cartoon like )  are excellent .  the movie begins with hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969 .  but the fact is ,  nixon did not start air america ,  he did not begin the lies .  johnson was responsible for air america and nixon inherited the lies ,  the war ,  and air america .  its not fair or accurate to portray nixon as a liar on the subject of air america .  all president's have inherited the lies of their predecessors .  nobody smart enough to fly a c-123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining .  that makes the downey character unbelievable .  a c-123 was a rugged airplane .  it could easily fly on one engine ,  or the two auxiliary jet engines .  the three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely .  pilots who flew with air america were civilian employees of the cia ,  they were not reckless soldiers of fortune .  they had a good reason to behave and believe in a future ,  if they survived their extremely dangerous job .  they were given double time towards a retirement pension .  they weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension .  dope was legal and a way of life in sea ,  as it still is today in afganistan .  if individual pilots tried to make money on the side ,  it was not cia policy .  the cia was fighting a war on communism ,  not drugs .  the writer based his story on  " war stories "  .  pilots love to bs anybody who will buy them a beer and listen .  the writer and director who had an ax to grind about viet-nam and nixon .  see the movie ,  and remember how it starts - it blames nixon for what existed for years .  remember ,  he didn't become president until jan 20 ,  1969 .   my favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle .  air america pilots put planes in places the aircraft designers never thought possible .  their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown .  instead ,  the director chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how dumb the cia was .  this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them .    mds fort valley virginia . 
0	there was some good build up of suspense throughout .  the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget .  we witness occasional spells of good acting ,  however ,  this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines .  understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had ,  sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you .  silence would have been golden here .  there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering ,   " i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother .  .  .  "  something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc .  you decide .  throughout the film i can't seem to find a connection or for that matter ,  sympathy with the characters ,  perhaps thats because they don't develop one throughout the film ,  character that is .  there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters ,  overshadowed again by some questionable scenes .  in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated ,  limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger .  a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic . 
1	okay ,  i grew up on who ,  but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker .  christopher eccleston made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving .    the writing is grand ,  the acting superb ,  the directing  ( which was dreadful in the old days )  is just fantastic .  i was very skeptical about this programme ,  and watched it merely out of being forced ,  but am now a huge fan and love it  ( i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming  " exterminate "  then )  .    a few of the things i love about the new programme -- 1 )  people actually notice when rose  ( billie piper )  disappears off the planet .  some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while ,  and then come home like nothing has happened ,  no one noticed .  2 )  chris eccleston's doc loves rose -- romantic or not will be debated ,  but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion .  he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her ,  which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again .  3 )  they talk and think like real people -- when rose is shown something outlandish or new  ( such as aliens )  she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked .  i never liked it when an assistant from the old show ,  who never saw anything alien ,  would just fit right in and adapt instantly .  i want to see the surprise on rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life .  she gives that to me .    the few things i don't like about this series :  1 ) nearly everything happens on earth  ( london or cardiff )  and i was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show .  2 )  that eccleston left so quickly ,  he really made the show brilliant .    but i can let those few things go -- i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to ,  so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth .    just don't take this show seriously -- it's fun ,  it's smart ,  it's entertaining ,  but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show .  it's pure fun ,  and pure british ,  and i can't get enough .  watch it with an open mind ,  and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy !   ps -- don't watch series 2 or later .  series 1 was brilliant ,  the first few episodes of series 2 were good ,  but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters .  utter rubbish ,  completely destroys the show . 
1	to start with ,  i have done some further research on the film .  firslty ,  jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film .  secondly ,  this was a very low budget film ,  created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir .  thirdly ,  the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers .  the producers of rififi asked them to film their ,  surprisingly ,   ( i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject ,   " surprisingly ,  for some not very obvious reason ,  they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop )  .    it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings .  to add on to my praise i will say this ;  some might say that this was a typical hollywood film ,  on the contrary ,  this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film .    laslty ,  i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins ,  and that side doesn't always have to be the good one .  for once ,  i can say that a film is not predictable !  ten stars ! 
0	thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery ,  it could have been an even worst disaster .  shots were slow & very repetitive .  different scenes ,  same shots ,  medium shot ,  medium shot ,  medium shot ,  snooze .  story line was rather empty .  william hurt was the worst .  where did he get that stupid accent from ?  random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much .  there were more shots of arbour traveling in her car than anything else .  the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes & it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters .  i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option .  great sedative if you can't sleep .  there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back . 
0	don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny .  it was a complete disaster ,  and one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show .  after watching his performance ,  all i can say is he is not made for movies .  with a daft script ,  or more like no storyline ,  there's nothing to keep you entertained .  full of annoying ,  unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way .  at the end of the film ,  ali g gives a speech .  he mentions ,  if you hated this film ,  tell people it was good .  not even the speech could save the movie ,  he probably knew its gonna be a stinker .  i would of given this a 0/10 ,  but the minimum start is 1 .  overall ,  don't even waste your time on this rubbish . 
1	this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen .  i really enjoyed the characters in the movie .  they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves .  it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie .   the story is almost non-stop from beginning to the end .  there are no boring moments .  i was totally captured by the movie .  and i thought the acting was great .   so if you want to see a fun movie .  you should look for the green butchers .  a great movie .   i give it 10/10
0	the biggest problem with  " in search of historic jesus "  is that there is very little search to it at all .  shick-sunn produced these  " documentary "  films in the 1970s and just into the '80s ,  which featured interviews with  " experts "  and discussion of  " science "  and  " facts "  to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on .   sadly ,   " historic jesus "  is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of christ .  unlike shick-sunn's more superior  " in search of noah's ark "  which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be ,  this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence .  the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned ,  but little other detective work is given much screen time .   for fans of these quasi-documentary films like  " jupiter menace "  and  " in search of bigfoot "  ,  etc .  ,  this movie doesn't offer much . 
0	on the scale of 1 to 10 ,  i gave this a 4 .  i thought the film was not very good ,  with too much violence and not one character to like .   on an erotic scale ,  i give this a 6 .  many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness .  i always enjoy nudity ,  and nancy travis and faye grant come through ,  but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic . 
1	this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in kings cross ,  sydney .  the plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss .  very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown .  the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist .  the setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done .  eg .  when one crim is searching for bullets for his gun .  i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies ,  and in this regard ,  the movie did not offend .  it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown .  the rest of the cast did an ok job ,  without any real stand-outs that i remember .  the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment .  the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification ,  thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake .  the director ,  gregor jordan ,  deserves special mention .  rating in my book - 7  ( of 10 )  . 
0	 " committed "  ,  as in heather graham being committed to saving her husband/marriage ,  and then being committed to a psychiatric ward in failure to do so :  what a clever ,  clever use of words .   one of those meaningless wanna-be philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh-so wise observations that verge on poetry  ( 90s chique club-poetry ,  better known as  " chit-chique poetry "  )  .  oh ,  it's so je-ne-sais-quoi .  .  .  written/directed  ( or  " auteured "  )  by a woman  ( lisa krueger ,  whoever the hell you are )  ,  this is a pointless ,  lethargically directed road-movie full of new age spiritualistic nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are merely seen-before or just plain dull .  the latinos in this movie ,  as part of the poor urban minority ,  are typically glorified in all their mysticism-obsessed primitivism as a  " spiritually superior "  people ,  which is the  " highlight "  of this film's political correctness .   the whole affair is lifeless ,  and ceases to be so only when occasional good cast members appear  ( kay place ,  baker ,  wilson )  .  on the other hand we have casey affleck ,  who is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is on par with first-degree murder as a crime .  i have rarely seen a more apathetic  " actor "  ;  a skinny ,  ugly moron who goes through his lines in a sleepy manner ,  almost as if he were uttering them in a half-awake quasi-dream ,  plus that weak voice ,  one of the weakest male voices i've heard in my life .   ( he must have gone to the tobey maguire lethargy school of acting .  )  to cast this idiot in anything speaks volumes about any movie ,  i . e .  about any director or producer .  hence ,  lisa krueger is a talentless waste of space .  we've also got that moron who had the lead role in the mst3k-spoofed  " werewolf "  ;  i think his name is goran vishnjic ,  but i'm not sure .  check out his ridiculous accent and the dumb speech . 
1	george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn .   " they died with their boots on ,  "  paints a different picture of general custer .  in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes ,  and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure .   errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point .  custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble .  somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments .  in spite of his poor standing ,  he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army .  through an error ,  custer receives a promotion in rank .  before this can be corrected ,  he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates .  his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero .  custer returns to his hometown ,  marries his sweetheart ,  libby who is played by olivia de havilland .  libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry .  custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans .  to prove his intentions ,  he enters into a treaty with crazy horse ,  the leader of the sioux  .  when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills ,  custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers .   errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears .  he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant ,  arrogant ,  romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene .  olivia de havilland's depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender ,  more gentle side .  the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn ,  who had acted together in several other movies ,  is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife .  the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland .  anthony quinn as crazy horse ,  sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott  ,  arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining .   the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie .  while it is not historically accurate ,  it is very entertaining .  the movie has a little bit of everything .  it has adventure ,  comedy and romance ,  so it appeals to a large variety of audiences .  the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact .  the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land .   
1	i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it ,  i had seen it when i was younger and loved it ,  after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do .   this is a love/hate film ,  if you like bottom ,  young ones ,  the comic strip ,  then you will find this funny .  if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother .  i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes ,  for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen .  .  it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it !   the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work .   yes ,  the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film . 
0	 "  while sporadically engrossing  ( including a few effectively tender moments )  and humorous ,  the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling .  with material like this ,  timing is everything  ( michael moore knew to release  " fahrenheit 9/11 "  before the 2004 elections )  ,  and the real tragedy of dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago ,  when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further .  in 2006 ,  mockery of the well-settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling  ( or imperiled )  as it did then .  "   frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence .    and if you didn't notice ,  michael moore didn't exactly help to defeat bush .   there was nothing engrossing about this film .  i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was ,  it was painful to watch .  if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit .  sadly this has none .  a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect .  as they say ,  with friends like these who needs enemies . 
0	put simply ,  this mini-series was terrible .  let me count the ways .  1 .  absurd plotting .  2 .  over-acting .  3 .  scattershot approach to characters .  4 .  annoying narration .  5 .  inability to create viewer interest .   this film can't even pass the  " soap opera for dummies "  test .  i'm sorry i have not read this award-winning novel ,  so i am judging it only as a film ,  but it really stinks .  imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers .  you look at the wide variety and want to taste them ,  but suddenly they are withdrawn ,  and you wonder where they went .  that's like this film ,  with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out .  there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series ,  yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all .   there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10 , 000 monkeys .  the pace is extraordinarily slow .    dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over-the-top that their characters are not believable .  joanne woodward's character is one-dimensional .    the persistent river metaphor becomes trite .   and ,  probably the most absurd part of the film--the cat .  this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers--well ,  come on now---it's not even good stephen king !   probably the most interesting character in the film ,  and one who is not drawn well ,  is john voss ,  the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film .   just about everyone in this film is unbelievable .   to sum up ,  there's little here to inspire .  the drama is poor melodrama .  it's just a terrible effort . 
0	this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons .  soulless ,  technically good and the usual in-jokes for adults .  maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa :  castle in the sky ,  but it was quite disappointing .   the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and obelix going to the viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well .  oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship .  .  .  yadda yadda .   the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes .  the vikings get all the best ones .  such as vikea  ( the viking's chief's wife )  giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid .  or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy  ( literally )  .  oh ,  and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious  ( as much for the voice acting as the dialogue )  .   for example ,  aboard the viking ship :   ( after a speech by abba ,  the captain's daughter )  olaf :  who is this new guy ?  captain :  that's my daughter ,  cod-brain !  olaf :  your .  .  .  daughter's .  .  .  a man ? 
1	it is clear this film's value far supersedes the cost with which the format  ( mini-dv )  implies .  in fact ,  the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so craftily into the storyline that i forgot the fact that i was not seeing the typical 35 millimeter film .  it has the core appeal of indie movies like clerks & the work of robert rodriguez combined with a fantastic  " new take "  on the romantic comedy genre .   " this is not a film "  is an honest film with honest portrayals and ,  it is a superbly paced narrative .  there is not one point in this film where i felt a scene could have  ( or should have )  been omitted .  on the contrary ,  the director pulls amazing performances out of truly gifted actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances .  from page to screen ,  this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits on so many levels  ( creative ,  technical or otherwise )  .  i highly recommend it for all who enjoy cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium . 
0	okay ,  i like to give the benefit of the doubt .  i watched his show .   it isn't funny to me .  all i remember was a lot of  " weird "  noises and yelling .  i don't think i even cracked a smile .  the only thing that somewhat resembled humour was his anjelina jolie/jennifer aniston bit .  i think you can get dumber by the minute watching it though .   also ,  what's with the  " ask whitey ?  "  section ?  is that a ripoff of  " ask a gay dude ? /black man ?  "  from chappelle's show ?  isn't it that obvious ?  but when chappelle did it ,  he was exposing the ignorance of the subject .  like borat .  but what's up with picking random white people and yelling stuff at them ?  that's not funny ,  its just plain dumb .   and i'm pretty sure i heard certain  " jokes "  of his somewhere else .  .  .  it seems abit like he's 'plagerising' bits & pieces ,  throwing in some  " loud "  yelling .   anyway ,  it wasn't funny .  seriously .  don't even waste your time . 
1	iron eagle may not be the most believable film plot-wise ,  but the characters are well written and very well acted .  if you cannot believe the characters ,  the film is a flop .   i believe the photography ,  especially the aerial photography is superb .  i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is endlessly compared .  it is one of the best pieces of aerial photography i have seen .  the soundtrack by basil paledouros  ( forgive the spelling ) is great ,  and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes .  i wish that portion of the soundtrack were available .   jason gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life ,  death ,  and responsibilities .  lou gossett is fab as chappy ,  both hard-bitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deaths .   there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and don't care to watch again .  then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again !  iron eagle is that kind of movie ! 
0	ignoring rocky 3 ,  this is easily hulk hogan's best film ,  and it still rates as one of the worst films ever .  hulk hogan essentially plays hulk hogan ,  bringing his wrestling buddies in for a film ,  with all the cliches to go along with it - the crooked promoter ,  the unstoppable monster ,  the injured kid ,  the sexy woman and .  .  .   " dookie "  . 
0	a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect .  dull ,  banal film bored the hell out of me .  more an idea then a film .  i was half way into this 77 minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was .  it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character .  certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center ,  there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough .  its not .  and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it ,  especially if one has seen the other ,  better films of a similar ilk  ( rendition with reese witherspoon for example ) 
1	 " icky flix "  is an excellent starting point for anybody with even a vague interest in the residents .  most of their classic videos are present  ( although  " earth vs .  flying saucers "  and  " don't be cruel "  are curiously missing )  ,  and the  " concentrates "  of their various cd-rom projects offer tantalizing glimpses into how the orbed ones have been spending their time since they realized mtv was no longer putting them in heavy rotation  ( or ,  indeed ,  showing videos period )  .   all of the videos on this compilation feature striking imagery and idiosyncratic music  ( with a choice of the original tracks and newly-recorded ones )  .  and two of them --  " the third reich 'n' roll "  and  " one minute movies "  -- are in the museum of modern art's permanent collection .  check out this dvd and find out why . 
0	this movie was not very well directed .  they almost totally disregarded the book . i guess they were trying 2 save time .  the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute .  some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book .  major parts of the book were once again chopped out . you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely .  also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary .  also i was surprised  (  not pleasantly )  by a new character that was no where in the book . one of my favorite characters  ( leper )  was poorly interpreted and portrayed .  he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book .  over all disappointing . 
0	man ,  is this lousy .  it doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so ,  keeping it brief ,  rebecca demornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store ,  he of the ponytail and jail-house tats .  when she cuts loose ,  she really cuts loose .  other than this torrid affair she's having  ( and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps )  she's a pretty cold fish .  her broke ,  ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out .  she's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor  ( dennis miller )  at bay .  and there's prisoner harry dean stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed .   all these people ,  and perhaps more ,  are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her .  somebody sends her dead flowers .  somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat .   ( the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot ,  i'm going to puke .  )  so who's doing it ?  guess .  no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending ,  but maybe a hint will help :  childhood abuse .   the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself ,  far more interesting than the movie .  what does  " childhood abuse "  mean ?  do we mean sexual abuse ?  physical ?  both ?  how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon ,  hard enough to break it ?  that's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids ,  just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood .  sexual abuse ?  that never happened to any of us ,  as far as i know ,  although i'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation .  in the samoan village i studied for two years ,  there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl .  the girl's family beat hell out of him .  the boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village ,  an exile that lasted two years .  by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone ,  including the child .   ( by the way ,  the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember dad's night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn't really established until about that time .  )  demornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called  " the social construction of trauma .  "  it's not there unless we put it there .  enough of the psychiatric lecture .  that will be fifteen cents .   you want trauma ?  i'll give you trauma .  the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca demornay's character ,  right from the beginning .  then ,  when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas ,  and pio donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads ,  the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest .  now that's traumatic .  it makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the california men's colony in san luis obispo .  don't get me wrong .  i don't dislike antonio banderas .  it's just that i'm not in love with him .  there aren't enough nude shots of rebecca demornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety .   here's an engaging way of surviving this movie .  instead of just sitting there puling ,  try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest .  it's a challenge ,  really ,  and may ,  for all we know ,  preserve your sanity . 
1	when i was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie .  we watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs .  but then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless .  i think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered  " oh dude .  .  .  .  .  "  it goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard .  i have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it - and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend - so it seems .  but now it is available !  i highly suggest renting it and brace yourself . 
1	i love this movie !  !  sure i love it because of madonna but who cares - it's damn funny !  !  !  *alanis rocks* .  when i first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987 ,  i thought it was all out hilarious !  madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look .  the all-time funniest part is when madonna ( nikki )  screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi .  and also when griffin dunne ( louden ) trips and falls at the apartment interview scene .  **alanis rocks** .  madonna's character nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time .   " didn't rob nothin' ,  when you rob a store you stick up the cashier .  we busted a few tapes ,  there's a bit of a difference "  i love that !  !  !  it's classic .  ***alanis rocks*** .  i don't know why this movie got slammed the way it did .  i see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if you're a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome .  anyone out there who wants to see some funny ,  classic entertainment then watch  " who's that girl ?  "  and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist ,  alanis will always  " rock ya "  completely to the end !  so does madonna in this film ,  and just entirely !  her acting is superb ! 
0	i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen .  my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time .  boy was i wrong and disappointed .   one touch of venus which starred mary martin ,  kenny baker ,  and john boles on broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and gardner ,  walker ,  and tom conway play the roles that martin ,  baker ,  and boles did on stage .  the kurt weill-ogden nash musical with book by nash and s . j .  perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood .    look at the names that went into this show .  given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production .  instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay ,  it was like all the wit was drained out of it .  doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway ,  but it's even too much for eve .   the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner .  of course when the statue goes missing ,  conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker ,  the last person to be with the statue .    the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them .  for reasons i don't understand ,  ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines .  the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker's friends and coworkers .  of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker .  you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker's role at least .  it was awkward to say the least .   only three songs survived from the score ,  don't look now ,  but my heart is showing ,  that's him ,  and the incomparable speak low .  haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway .  for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century ,  ogden nash ,  were done over by ann ronnell .  i suspect the infamous code was at work here .   in lee server's biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man ,  howard duff .  when duff and gardner reunited ,  walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to gardner off camera .  i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either .   hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you'll get to see it the way ,  weill ,  nash ,  and perelman wrote it . 
0	great premise ,  poor execution .  cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written ,  poorly directed ,  poorly edited ,  waste of film .  only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food .   joan chen ,  mercedes ruehl ,  kyra sedgwick ,  and alfre woodard should fire their agents . 
0	i love this show .  i watched every episode last year .  i bought the dvds .  and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have retooled this great show .  and you have taken what made it work and ruined it .  you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends .  sam ,  sully ,  lizzy and piper .  i love the other characters as well ,  but they are good in small dozes like derek ,  darcy and even sully .  it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in .  it is overdose .  while things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying .  i was so looking forward to the return of this show .  so please bring back the charm .  even if you could not fit piper into the show at least bring lizzy back .  but i loved those girls .  they brought the fun .  the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well .  that was the charm .  and that great dog as well .   i hope the network  ( fox )  forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show .  i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up ,  but tonight's episodes were bad .  i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool ,  because no one was laughing except 2-3 times .  i apologized to them and said i don't know what happened .  and about 10 minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show piper or lizzy and this was no longer a must see tv comedy . 
0	a terminally dull mystery-thriller ,  which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly .  the ludicrous script is full of  ( minor spoiler )  people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to ,  and the director doesn't seem able to work up any energy and suspense .  the gooey sequence that kind of  " explains "  the film's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film .   ( *1/2 ) 
1	this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection ,  one of nine - the only one done in black and white ,  and the only one featuring trinity .  richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way ,  and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice .  if you're a fan of the matrix ,  you will need to put this on your short list . 
1	just watched this on dvd three times - once the 'normal' way ,  once with the scenes in consecutive order  ( in this doozy of a film noir ,  the beginning ,  middle and end of the story intertwine )  ,  and once with the director's commentary running .  quite amazing .  a bare-bones tale ,  told with more flair ,  energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today .    i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento ,  which turned me on to nolan in the first place .  can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget  ( and bigger box-office stars )  in his next film ,  insomnia . 
1	david lynch shot his first film ,  'erasurehead' ,  over several years ,  adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash .  kevin smith made 'clerks' at work ,  while working as a clerk ,  and robert rodriguez has boasted that 'from dusk till dawn' cost precisely $30 , 000 .  but $30 , 000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery .  and what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries ,  and all the dorkishness of smith ,  but absolutely none of the talent .  such a figure is mark borchardt ,  the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years .  borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day ;  one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that he's simply  ( on the evidence presented in 'american movie' )  not very good .  and like a modern day ed wood ,  he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers ,  his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature .  the collection includes his warring parents ,  his best friends  ( one a criminal ,  the other a reformed drug addict )  ,  his own hapless children and best of all his aged uncle bill .  bill may live in a trailer park ,  and just about have given up on life ,  but he is the owner of a small fortune  ( $280 , 000 to be precise )  and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film .  borchardt manages to enlist a few actors to perform  ( alongside himself ,  of course )  but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work  ( even bill has a role on camera )  .  on british tv ,  the bbc brilliantly scheduled a screening of 'american movie' back-to-back with 'lost in la mancha' ,  the story of terry gilliam's ill fated attempt to film 'don quixote' .  in that film ,  one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display  ( inadequate as it was to the task in hand )  ,  and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film ;  whereas borschadt is not only penniless ,  but also such a clown that he can't even pronounce the name of his own work  ( 'coven' )  properly .  ultimately ,  borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed ,  but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures .  if this film was fiction ,  you'd dismiss it as unbelievable ;  but as it is ,  it's one of the funniest documentaries you're likely to see . 
1	i do love b- horror films .  i however ,  am generally not a huge fan of  " so stupid it's funny "  films .  i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed :  the bed that eats ,  is so one of a kind ,  and so original .  there are plenty of question marks ,  plenty of plot holes ,  and the wtf factor is cranked up to 11 ,  but i was really not bored for a second .  i really couldn't call it creepy at any point ,  every minute i was saying to myself  " what the hell is this bed/film going to do next !  "  i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b- movies ,  and even she was pretty into it .  the effects were actually very inventive and the colors ,  and atmosphere were quite good .  it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film ,   ( albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency )  and the acting wasn't terrible .  i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible ,  but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept ,  that that fact didn't really bother me .  seriously ,  for me ,  this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget ,  but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future .  does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre ?  totally fantastic . 
1	i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie , late night about 8 years ago .  what a wild and funny 45 minutes . i was absolutely knocked out by chase-shoot-out at the end that takes place at night  , inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a wrecking ball .  .  .  . incredible .  i vaguely remember stacy keach  , stealing a cop car ,  faking being a cop and strong arming some winos .  .  .  . wino to keach " hey , why ya hasslin us ?  .  .  . keach " it's my job "  . you're correct .  they don't make them like that anymore . great movie .  the golden70's .  .  . hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost treasures .  .  . hickey and boggs being one such . 
0	besides the fact that this guy is a liar ,  he is also a total idiot ,  and a thief in the comedy community .  once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show ,  i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little .  i can't help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno 911 and american body shop .  it shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind .  it's hard to believe that even joe rogan can make someone look like an moron .  please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible .  haven't we suffered enough ? 
1	first of all - i hardly ever watch swedish movies ,  and this is actually the second time in my life i watch a swedish movie on cinema !  therefor ,  i believe it's one of the best swedish movies ever !  the combination of thrill and humour is outstanding ,  and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh !  the plot is about this man ,  a writer who wants to go to germany after world war ii and help the germans to start over .  on the way to germany ,  he is trying to help his friends on the train ,  which is however a bad idea .  what a clumsy jerk !  and poor robert gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always get in the way  .  .  .  ouch !  !  !  but he still got his great mood .  a positive guy .  robert gustafsson have done some less great movies the last years or so ,  and this is really a relief .  he is great in this movie .  after all - this is one of the best swedish movies ever ,  and peter dalle has made an excellent job !  congratulations ! 
0	there were but two reasons for me to see this film .  first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it  ( who are both good actors )  and i had nothing better to do .  while seeing the film though ,  i immediately thought of something better to do :  sleep !  this film is a complete waste of time .  it is a standard ex-cop flick .  the ex-copper is the best there ever was ,  but he was fired .  he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day .  all big surprises  ( not !  !  !  )  .  go to sleep ,  or if you have insomnia ,  try this one .   4 out of 10
1	this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow' .  it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here ,  more or less without exception ,  were perfect in their parts .  in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell .  what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's dottiness ,  tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact ,  lucy is not really all that nice !  megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda .  john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him .   as i said ,  the script follows the story quite faithfully .  the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor !  theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done .  the whole thing looks beautiful as well ,  really capturing a perfect english autumn .   its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing . 
1	i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boringno fights or shooting ,  cops ,  robbers ,  cowboys or indians .  it was definitely not a cool film to like .  so i didn't see trc until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful ,  captivating films i have seen .  all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene .  the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story .  my two favourite scenes are bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end ,  directed and edited to perfection .  the quality and phrasing of jenny agutter's voice when she calls :  'daddy !  my daddy ! ' wrenches emotion from the viewer .  tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it .   this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art ,  as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achievecreation of an emotional experience . 
0	if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors ,  eating non-ants ,  and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative ,  then this is the movie for you .  basically ,  a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants  ( the most intelligent actors in this film )  in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination .  throughout the movie the two scientists  ( and a girl they rescued from the ants )  use everything at their disposal  ( computers ,  green dye ,  and horrid acting )  ,  but to no avail .  i guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly .   the title of the movie  " phase iv "  is something of a mystery .  this is not a spoiler ,  but  " phase i "  starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach  " phase iv "  until the end credits roll .  apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report :   " hang in there buddy !  only 1 more phase until final credits !  "  as a mst3k episode ,  this one wasn't very good for two reasons :  1 )  this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons ;  and 2 )  this movie is so bad not even j&tb can lighten it up .  there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies .   the movie does have a trick/surprise ending ,  but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me . 
1	meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count .   in what was merely a precursor of what was to come ,  murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery .  tripper harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years .  sarcastic all the time ,  smart when he has to be ,  stern when he needs to be ,  and caring when it suits him ,  murray infuses tripper with that snl glint in the eye .   the c . i . t's are merely in awe as they cower beneath the comic genius that is mr .  murray .   summer isn't summer without a viewing of meatballs .  one of the best comedies to ever grace the screen . 
1	during world war ii ,  two byelorussian  ( soviet russian )  soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis ,  as they trudge through snowy terrain ,  searching for food and safety .  if you happen not to like black-and-white  " foreign "  films ,  you may still enjoy  " voskhozhdeniye "   ( retiled in english  " the ascent "  )  .  director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well ,  despite its being a largely introspective piece of work .  her untimely death ,  in a car accident ,  made this ms .  shepitko's final film ,  unfortunately .   after the opening mission is declared ,  there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods ,  but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting .  leading players vladimir gostyukhin  ( as the spiritually wounded  " rybak "  )  and boris plotnikov  ( as the physically wounded 'sotnikov "  )  successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism .  their allegorical performances ,  under shepitko's sharp direction ,  provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story .   ******** voskhozhdeniye  ( 4/2/77 )  larisa shepitko ~ vladimir gostyukhin ,  boris plotnikov ,  lyudmila polyakova ,  anatoli solonitsyn
1	being a d . b .  sweeney fan ,  i've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time .  i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable .  it had some really hilarious scenes .  the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling ,  but i think the movie also showed that it's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it's been derailed . 
1	apart from the low budget ,  there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time ,  plus the same 2 half tracks ,  this film is absolute top class .  everything is accurate .  that is the point ,  i think ,  from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment . everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms .  grey men with the life drained out of them .  forget us made gung ho rubbish like blackhawk down and private ryan .  this is one of the best war films ever .  only cross of iron beats this for tension and story .  please could we have a proper un-dubbed german language with english subtitles version in the uk  ?  without having to pay ridiculous import charges from europe .  most other dvd's are multilingual .  why not this one  ? 
1	this is possibly the most perfect film i have ever seen - in acting ,  adaptation and direction .  it is self-contained and of a kind ,  so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films ,  just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art .   and it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out ! 
1	this movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers ,  actors ,  actresses ,  and dancers .  many who are no longer with us .  those which we are blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999 ,  through this film lets us recognize the talents that existed then .  this is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons .  due to the educational history in music ,  drama ,  filming ,  design ,  singing ,  etc .  ,  this movie alone belongs to the people of this country .   i viewed this movie recently .  the sound was excellent !  the movie appeared to be complete ,  color and clarity was fare ,  but good considering how old this movie is without any repairs on frames .  i agree with all prior positive reviews .  i do not have any negative views .   i only would like to make one request .  please to whom it my concern ,  please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience . 
1	i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films .  i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - i was a little drunk and tired .   i went to bed ,  and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep .  i couldn't stop thinking about why ,  so i got up ,  switched the tv back on ,  loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie .   well done alex frayne sir ,  you've managed to implant your film into this old ,  cynical movie goers head ,  and that takes doing .  so 10 out of 10 to you .   i can't say i 'love' this film of yours ,  but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc . 
1	while it's not  " perfect "  ,  it's close .  love barbara stanwyck ,  sz sakall ,  sidney greenstreet ,  dennis morgan ,  robert shayne  ( superman's police chief )  ,  the housekeeper ,  the waiter at restaurant felix ,  and the judge .  .  .  .  .  . i can go on and on .  this movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since i was a youngster ,  and my children grew up with it ,  too !   " the baby swallowed the watch "  was always my son's favorite line .   sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly ,  funny s .  z .  sakall .  dennis morgan has a few great songs ,  too .   i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake  ( blah )  . 
1	action packed , with my favorite type of creature . i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it , cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film . it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled , where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out , probably the mood i was in at the time . special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls . of course there'es a duschload of movies out there exactly like this , the film still has it's own style and flavor , which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways . 
0	this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa rica .  although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in costa rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil  ( -he he ,  right )   .  .  . well ,  this is all a lie .  this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos salazar herrera about a love triangle  ( super cliché soap opera-like subject )  and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of costa rica with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region ,  but at the end it never was approved by the government .  now ,  it may have some nice footage about the beaches ,  but that's it ;  nothing bigger than that .  .  .  it is all in the camera .  most of the actors are lousy ,  except for two or three .  the rest lack of sense of what acting means :  they overact most of the time .  the story is completely common and cliché ,  worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said .  .  because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil ,  but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle .  the script is nothing impressing ,  it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought .  it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes .  .  .  but besides that is pretty decent .  the director did an alright job ,  i mean ,  he is not like an oliver stone , but he did his job with the resources he had handy .  i would like to question him why instead of using costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones .  .  i mean after all they bragged about being an 100% costarican production .  .  .  that's what you at least expect .  final the end is is not well done ,  there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless .  besides being the most elaborated movie in all costarican history ,  i think it's mediocre .  you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash .  never heard of  " pi "  ?  anyway ,  if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies ,  this one will do ,  but you are definitively not missing anything . 
1	chuck jones's 'rabbit seasoning' ,  the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy ,  is often considered to be the best of the three .  while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons ,  i would have to concede that 'rabbit seasoning' is the most finely honed script .  here ,  the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello's 'who's on next' routine .  as a long term daffy fan ,  i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines  ( the famous  " pronoun trouble "  being one of the all time classics )  and does most of the work .  bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer ,  as always ,  is the befuddled dupe .  part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs .  elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst ,  being shot in the face again and again ,  his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions .  it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration  " you're despicable "  .  as intricate an example of chuck jones's impeccable timing as you'll come across ,  'rabbit seasoning' is a true classic . 
0	 " i remember waiting to be born .  .  .  "     " vision quest that was the american west .  "     " we went to a psychic .  .  .  "     " i'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo "     "  .  .  . the place is haunted .  .  .  "     " i think there's another dimension right here .  "    an artist  ( marta becket )  and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley .  there ,  they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner .  and ,  once finished ,  she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one .  in many ways ,  it's highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film fitzcarraldo or field of dreams--though amargosa is a documentary of a real person--not a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner .  her husband eventually leaves--much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose .  so ,  today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion ,  tom .   what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives .  if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities ,  then you'll more likely appreciate the film .  her talking about how she remembers her birth ,  ghosts ,  vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people .  in addition ,  her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers ,  though with my background in environmental concerns and biology ,  i see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals .  so on two different accounts ,  i tend to think quite the opposite of marta--who is more of a  " feeler "  and  " sensing "  individual .  depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions--and i am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut !  you'll just have to guess what i think .   now despite all this ,  the film is interesting and marta's life is definitely not dull--particularly since in recent years ,  people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform .  there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world .  while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews ,  i also can't be as negative as the one review ,  as there is definite merit to this odd documentary .  i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual !  i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life--that is a rare gift .    i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff--where i am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film--probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum !  it sure would be interesting .   by the way ,  and i am not trying to be sarcastic ,  but when marta's husband was having affairs ,  with whom did this occur ?  !  after all ,  they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he'd find partners .   by the way ,  if you'd like to see her perform and/or stay at her hotel ,  it can be found at www . amargosaoperahouse . com/  .  the site is in english ,  french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices . 
0	like almost everyone else ,  i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 .  it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time .  i really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . it's really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really ,  really bad .   miles o'keeffe stars as ator ,  a muscle-bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men .  we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang-glider in about 5 minutes .  yeah ,  right !  there's also a fairly attractive actress  ( can't remember her name )  who wears a hub-cap as a chest shield .  oh ,  and i can't forget that wacky asian side-kick thong .  he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie .  he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking .  .  .  .  . and he failed miserably .   the film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper mst3k format .  if you watch that version ,  you'll laugh yourself silly !    " i'm huge !  !  !  !  "   rating : 1
1	ok ,  so maybe it's because i'm from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film ,  but i found this great fun .  cheap fun to be sure ,  but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all .  i was actually quite effected when they died .  in particulare when the captain finally fell .  the script ?  well it ; s a game of 2 halfs .  the opening half of the film is well written and sharp .  the last half hour is not so great ,  with many questions left unanswered .  this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me .  but nevertheless ,  good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton . 
0	i am astonished at the major comments here for this ok surf film .  it really stems from the  " california dreamin "  school of barnyard to beach antics and isn't really plausible .  the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean ,  is just plain silly .  in australia where most urban teens do surf ,  this film was laughed at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt .  made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s ,  it is fun to watch and looks and sounds good ,  but it is not a in a classic class at all .  even the actors didn't outlast this .  we're seriously in liquid bridge or ride the wild surf or beach blanket bingo land here .  oz stars like occy and big wednesday hero gerry lopez are drafted in to add head nodding recognition to our farm boy's wave prowess ,  but it only made the crowd in the cinema guffaw .  it is for 10 years olds who do not question much .  it's not even in gods hands and that was silly too . 
0	outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie .  happy you .  the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history .  and still .  .    seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes .  robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie ,  trying to copy a younger gösta ekman .  ekman ,  by the way ,  is the only actor fulfilling the expectations .    credit that can be given is for the photo ,  splendid idea using black and white .  music is ok .   but over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience . 
1	i love movies that take you into them .  a movie that actually leaves you feeling weak when its over and this kind of movie is rare .   damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen .  this movie has a cutting edge to it .  a main stream cast for such a low budget .  why is it that a man with this much talent and charisma  ,   (  not to mention sex appeal in ways beyond most other actors  )  can do this with so little money to work with ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  these actors really believe in his script and raw talent as a director ,  writer and actor .  i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  ,  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him .  damian i have heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world get to you .  martin gets this  ,  fellini got it and you will always get it .  the fire and passion in you is what we love to watch on screen .  thankyou for being different and having the guts to write like you do .  you are a one of a kind director ,  do not listen to the empty vessels . 
1	yul brynner is major surov ,  a singing ,  dancing ,  vodka-drinking russian officer stationed near the austrian -hungarian border during the hungarian uprising of 1956 in anatole litvak's the journey .  though the film has yet to be released on video or dvd ,  it remains one of brynner's most compelling performances .  because of the political unrest ,  a group of travelers cannot fly out of budapest but are put on a bus to vienna .  before they can reach the border ,  however ,  their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the russians led by major surov .   the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country .  indeed lady ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger ,  paul fleming  ( jason robards ,  jr .  )  who pretends to be an american but fools no one .  she is helping fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him .  among the other passengers are a british journalist played by robert morley ,  an american family played by e . g .  marshall ,  his wife anne jackson and their two children ,  one of which is the screen debut of little ron howard .   major surov takes a romantic interest in lady diana ashmore  ( deborah kerr )  ,  and a romance of sorts develops between them .  she offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip ,  however ,  though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats .  the cold war intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing .  it remains ,  however ,  one of my favorite yul brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance . 
0	i found this movie to be a big disappointment ,  especially considering the cast .  the characters are not believable ,  as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves .  the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed .  the special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies .  a typical unimaginative slasher flick .   it's hard to believe ,  make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy ,  noisy idiots .  equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly were to find it ,  in spite of the fact the creature has evaded capture ,  or even photographing .   the man that pulls off the impossible in capturing the chupacabra alive is our one dimensional dr .  pena  ( giancarlo esposito )  .  the only thing dr .  pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his dart gun .  a dart gun that works were mere bullets fail .   the captain of the ship  ( john rhys-davies )  is introduced as a 'war veteran' .  he employs his military prowess by having his men shoot at the creature ,  regardless of were on the ship they happen to be .  the navy seals that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything .   dylan neal plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to catch a thief .  he spends most of the movie tagging along with whomever is trying to kill the creature at the moment .   the creature doesn't even closely resemble a chupacabra .  it doesn't behave like one either .  instead of a small ,  shy ,  secretive animal that hunts by stealth at night ,  we get a bulletproof freddy kruger ,  killing everything in sight .  a simple search on google would have been very helpful to the writers and the special effects crew . 
0	i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13 .  the ice cream scene haunts me to this day .  i'm 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child .  when i heard they were remaking it ,  i thought it might be good but when i saw the film ,  it's 100% not the same film .  it's not a remake .  it's a bad stolen idea .  it was completely ruined .  the cast ,  maria bello ,  laurence fishburne ,  ethan hawke ,  gabriel burne ,  john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film .  it was just wrong .  even the setting was completely opposite .  and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door ?  why didn't help show up sooner ?  stupid .  no sense . 
0	cave dwellers ,  or the blade mater ,  or whatever it's called ,  is in one word :  vile !  i saw this on mst and i laughed not only at the great running commentary ,  but at the inept film making that was demonstrated .  sunglasses ,  tire tracks and where did ator get a hang glider ?  then they lift a few shots from another movie ,  where eagles dare as tom servo points out .  to show just how cheap this movie really is ,  watch the scene where ator and thong have to battle invisible swordsmen .  or even better ,  look for the giant hose dressed up like a snake that ator must wrestle !  and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie ? 
0	steve smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie .  poor actors thrashing a horrible script pretty much sums this one up .  two hours of your life you'll never get back !  go get a root canal instead - you'll enjoy it more . 
1	a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution .  ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won't  "  go along with the program  "  and sets out to let the world know what they're missing .  the supporting cast is great as well ,  and the music is the  " soul "  of the film .  i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library . 
1	due to its predictable ,  second-rate title ,   ( the one it was distributed under in italy ,  at least )  i didn't expect much from this movie .  thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house  (  " la casa maledetta "  means  " the cursed house "  )  .  well ,  i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene !  the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres ,  reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip-offs ,  but this was going to be something completely different .  .  .  this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller !  very well written and directed ,  good actors ,  interesting plot .  .  .  ok ,  i've tried not to spoil the viewing of  " 7 hyden park "  for you ,  which i'd highly recommend to everyone .    p . s .  am i wrong ,  or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand  ( she's paralyzed from the waist down )  her feet and legs move a little too much ?   (  .  .  .  and i'm not talking of the  " bad dream "  sequence .  ) 
0	i clicked onto the encore mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see ,  island of dr .  moreau .  i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy .  an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm .  suddenly ,  an assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head  ( with a side arm )  from across the street .  after waiting for  " c "  to turn around and look ,  the  " a "  tries to shoot  " c "  and clearly misses .   " c "  was a much easier target ,  the old man couldn't have run far .  duh !  there is a chase and  " c "  is on an elevator  " a "  is on the roof ,  so he tries to shoot the cable ,  which is parallel to the  " a "  .  he hits and severs the cable ,  impossible .  later ,  this time with a specialized rifle ,  the  " a "  lines up on  " c "  from maybe 50 meters ,  but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead .  how does charlie get his parts ?  does daddy go to the producers and say  " look ,  my kid needs work .  .  .  "  it reminds me of his stupid sit - com .  all the actors are good except ,  yup  .  .  .  you got it .  i usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c . s . i .  to come on .  let's see ,  what can i do for the next hour .  i know ,  i'll trim my toenails !  much better use of my time . 
1	the creative team that brought us police squad - and the naked gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled ,  after their delivery of the first episode .  basically ,  the show was never given any chance .  typical hollywood .  the contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that ,  for the show to be funny ,  the viewer would actually need to watch it ;  most shows are presented on tv with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food ,  or going to the toilet ,  etc .   the humor of the show is extremely dry  ( it uses no laugh-track )  ,  and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen ,  regardless of logic ,  as long as it was totally unbelievable ;  so ,  for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery .   those familiar with the naked gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films .  in the films ,  nielsen developed a particular  " take "  approach - that is ,  eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected .  this doesn't happen in the show ,  where nielsen's drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him .  also ,  there are no romances in the show ,  and no parodies of mtv .  finally ,  the show takes certain risks that the films avoid ;  in the first episode ,  drebin ,  to  " re-enact the crime "  ,  has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way .  this is actually a risky bit of humor ,  since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime ,  for no other reason than experimentation .  this sort of thing rarely happens in the films .   taken individually ,  each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the naked gun films ,  since they are both more compact  ( more happens in a shorter time-frame )  ,  yet more leisurely paced  ( there's not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films )  .  there are some inconsistencies that happen in the films  ( primarily  " 2 "  and  " 3 "  )  that never occur in the show's shorter time-frame .   of course ,  there's no doubt that naked gun  ( the first film )  is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema .  and if you watch the tv show episode after episode in one sitting ,  the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance .   none the less ,  it would be useful to have a dvd of this ,  and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - if laughter has ,  as some claim ,  medicinal value ,  watching this show is good for one's health . 
0	i wanted to like this movie ,  but there is very little to like about it .  it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa  ( northwest iowa ,  i guess )  ,  reminiscent of norman lear's cold turkey ,  which was one of the best movies ever made ,  according to people on imdb .  so far ,  so good .  and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbank's motel on earth ?  well ,  give it a chance ,  it's supposed to be a comedy .  okay ,  so far ,  so good .  but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do ,  and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had .  the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal ,  either .  michael brings a dog back to life ,  and we're supposed to be in awe of that .  the people make up corny country songs .  in the end ,  stapleton dances with travolta .  big deal .  if she was smart ,  she wouldn't even be in this movie .  when it was over ,  i thought ,   " gee ,  what a stupid ,  tasteless ,  boring ,  corny ,  sacrilegious movie !  "  it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else . 
1	all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come .  you have the stellar cast - michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career ,  fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib ,  and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence .  give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous ,  and that's encouraging for a kickoff ,  but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream .   the script is impressively taut ,  intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum ,  and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock .  if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas ,  then this is not quite as good as  " the insider "  ,  but the whole thing is more than nervy enough . 
0	somebody decided to make a  " black version "  of airplane .   somebody decided to make a really ,  really bad  " black version "  of airplane .   somebody decided to make a really ,  really bad  " black version "  of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes .   somebody decided to make a really ,  really bad  " black version "  of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast .   this movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time .  if nothing else ,  it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment .   it's not a black thing ,  it's not a white thing ,  it's just a bad thing .  a really ,  really bad thing .  picking it apart point-by-point would be a waste of time .  the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it .  do yourself a favor .  .  .  go buy a picture of a purple airplane ,  and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer .   this one definitely goes under the category of  " what the  ! ^@@&* !  were they thinking ?  ?  ?  ?  " 
1	i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true .  i found  " mission cléopâtre "  better than it's predecessor for different reasons ,  but the major one is this  :  it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie .  the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy  ( who's name is escaping me ,  but he's the other architect )  .  i don't know how this movie played in english ;  my first language is french so i didn't have that problem .  .  .  i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate .  i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said ,  but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too .  i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves  " astérix et obélix "  . 
0	copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 hindi movie called  " call girl "  !   " call girl "  had an identical story line .  the way in which the protagonists fall in love ,  then rebel and the climax all same in both these films !   " call girl "  is better than water ,  at least from the story telling point of view .  it was not as agonizingly slow as water !  water on the contrary does not progresses at all .  the aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with kalyani for ever !  are indian film makers any better than just being great copiers these days ?  well they call it  " being inspired "  .  in their language it is :   " getting inspired  ( without any citation that is !  )  "  !   :  ) 
0	this show reminds me of an episode of  " the simpsons ,  "  where smithers had just been fired by mr .  burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed .  all he did to while the way the hours was to drink and watch comedy central .  the implication was that comedy central was a pathetic tv channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time .   " mind of mencia "  is slightly better than most of comedy central's programming ,  but it still serves as an example of why this channel is low-quality filler for people with absolutely no lives .    truth be told ,  mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws out trite ,  soft-ball ethnic jokes and cashes in on bland stereotypes of people based on their race ,  gender ,  or economic status ,  or a combination of two out of three of these characteristics .  if you've heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work ,  believe me ,  you've heard what passes as comedy on  " mind of mencia .  "  carlos also tries to make fun of current events ,  but lacks creativity or originality .  this is not to say that carlos is a washout all the time .  i found some of his skits amusing ,  such as his rap video portrayal as an oil sheik .  if you find bland ,  run-of-the-mill comedy up your alley ,  you'll probably enjoy  " mind of mencia .  "  for those people who are tired of repetitive ,  pedestrian comedians trotting out the same old time-worn jokes ,  stay away . 
0	what a shocker .  for starters ,  i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time .  it didn't make me scared ,  horrified ,  or make me sympathetic towards the characters ;  it was simply annoying .  the jerky camera movements were also annoying .  the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror .  there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth ,  but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot .  and then there's the ending .  i'm still not really sure what to make of it .  i guess it was supposed to be clever twist ,  then shed some light on the situation ,  but it was just stupid .   the case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it ,  so i figured it couldn't be too bad .  i was wrong .  if you see it ,  you should probably just leave it on the shelf . 
1	rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun ,  fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly .  rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star .  unfortunately ,  her career is getting no where in danny mcguire's night club .  when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest ,  she decides to follow her dreams and enters .  she reminds the publisher of her grandma ,  who he was deeply in love with many years ago .  but when she finds this success ,  her boyfriend is not happy about it .   i had never seen rita before this ,  and i am so glad i did !  she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress .  there are some good numbers in here ,  not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to .  one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character .  he should have supported his girlfriend !  but anyway ,  that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie .  cover girl is a glorious ,  fluffy film - perfect escapism .  not everyone's ideal movie ,  but a wonderful movie nonetheless ,  due to rita hayworth's star power .  great movie ,  truly impressed . 
0	i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie .  .  . ever . i could stand to watch this movie ,  and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just .  .  . a downgrade .  the first is open water ,  that just had no point whatsoever .  the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel ( correct me if i'm wrong ,  please .  )  , and that ending line came as a shock .  it was like ,   " if must fight .  .  . win .  "  then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing ,  and i was like ,  oh .  okay ,  so it'll take a while for this next part .  and then the credits hit the screen .   geez man !  !  hopefully ,  i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again ,  i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid ,  i really ,  really do .  .  . 
0	i did not quite get barnens o  it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched .  the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was .  i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me ,  or boring  or confusing .  there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up  .  probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be  " when you are alone ,  you can control things  "  and  " i will show them  " - or something like that  . the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up   " the last summer as a child  " he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max .  so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't .

0	let's see ,  cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped .  you'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts !  turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world .  .  .  . the world of religious fantasy ! --complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of papier mache .  everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor chap who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this masterpiece of the absurd .  i think i'd opt for hellfire myself .  go see something else ,  unless you are stoned ,  in which case ,  you might actually like it !  couldn't hurt ! 
1	anna christie  ( 1930 )   anna christie has some terrific parts ,  and some amazing performances ,  and yet it should be even better than it is .  it has drama .  some of the scenes are really atmospheric ,  and if the interior shots around the table are a bore ,  other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting .  then there are the nearly historical ,  lively scenes set in coney island  ( even a brief jittery roller coaster ride )  ,  and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds ,  and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over ,  and the women  ( scantily dressed )  egg the men on is weirdly sexual come-on kind of way .  all the while garbo  ( at the front of the crowd )  watches .   garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie .  she plays all sides of her character .  she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish .  she laughs and cries ,  withdraws and pushes outward .  in some ways it's a forward looking ,  remarkable movie  ( directed by clarence brown ,  who has a whole series of significant films from this pre-code sound era )  .   though based on a successful eugene o'neil play ,  it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times .  marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked .  and then there is greta garbo ,  who really does have a natural presence ,  even if it seems she's overacting ,  just slightly ,  at times  ( but then ,  so is everyone else )  .  garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress ,  and this is her talking film debut .  audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year . 
0	i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works  ( e . g .  linda grant's when i lived in modern times ) usually from the israeli side of the fence .  also ,  a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year ,  so with such a recommendation .  .  .   however i actually found myself nodding off at points !  admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters .  once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes ,  i went with it ,  but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film .  i liked the concept of a restrained ,  almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl ,  the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter .  but personally i think the film has been over hyped .  i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything  ( it's definitely not )  but even a little more dialogue would have helped . 
0	from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules  ( 1983 )  ,  comes its even more preposterous  ( read goofier )  sequel :  right off the bat ,  we get another unwieldy  " beginning of time "  prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film !  ;  a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman-like scrolling credits sequence .  narrative-wise ,  here we have four rebellious gods who steal zeus' seven all-important  ( but poorly animated )  thunderbolts  a crime which ,  for one thing ,  sets the moon careening on a collision course with planet earth !  faster than you can say  " nepotism "  ,  zeus  ( once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young claudio cassinelli )  sends his champion  who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to ,  one presumes ,  the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store .   no sooner has hercules  ( lou ferrigno  as if you didn't know )  touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels  ( milly carlucci and sonia viviani )  in need of his getting them out of distress !  ;  the former  ( who would go on to become an italian tv personality )  seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people (  !  )   which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs .  mothra  ( 1964 )  !  !  just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible ,  the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol' king minos  ( william berger again )  from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy .  typically ,  hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a gorgon  an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior clash of the titans  ( 1981 )  bothered to watch this flick  ( complete with the same  " reflection in a shield "  come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is )  !  !  and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve ,  cozzi has hercules and minos turn into a cosmic version of  " king kong vs .  godzilla "  for one of their battles and later still ,  king kong gets to grips with a large snake ,  an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original .  i swear it :  this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth !    as had been the case with the first film ,  the cast is full of old reliables like the afore-mentioned berger ,  cassinelli and venantino venantini  ( as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day )  and up-and-coming starlets  not just carlucci but also maria rosaria omaggio  ( as a younger hera !  )  ,  serena grandi ,  pamela prati and ,  once again ,  eva robbins  ( whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film )  ;  for what it's worth ,  pino donaggio's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film .  if you have stuck with this review so far ,  you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take :  either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws .  i'm sure i've left out some of its ineptitudes but i wouldn't forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair  ( yes ,  it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me )  ,  namely the décor of the rebellious gods' lair which is in the shape of a giant marblekettle !  !   at this stage ,  one might well wonder why i gave this film  ( and its predecessor )  a rating instead of a  ( not entirely unjustified )  bomb ;  in the past ,  i've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating .  i don't know :  maybe it's because i'm in a  " sword-and-sandal "  state-of-mind at the moment  ( with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days !  )  but ,  after all ,  uncharacteristically for me ,  i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something ,  no ? 
0	at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final executioner' .  .  at least where i come from .  a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood .  .  and that's about it .  lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue .  has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while ,  and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people .  great job on the dubbing too guys (  !  )  best moment :  when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck ,  he just gets out his gun and bang !  why not do that earlier ?  it's a mystery .  as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place .  i'm still puzzling over that one myself now .  .  2/10
1	-it has carla gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo*   - " jaded "  is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past .  whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun .  but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down .  she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital .  after that ,  we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past .   -director and co-writer caryn krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget .  it hand-held and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it .  the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it .  the standout feature in the movie is of course carla gugino who bares it all in this movie .  she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in  " sin city "  .  christopher mcdonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless ,  but he is fun to watch .  i didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got .  the movie is r rated and it's that for a very good reason .  it's very sexual and very graphic at times .  it's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there .  although there is one pointless scene where we see chris mcdonald getting it on ,  that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem i guess .  the only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie .  it's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something   -it's a shame that the talented caryn krooth has never made a feature film since this .  this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget .  i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director .  jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema ,  instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making .   -hide the kids and close the curtains ,  you don't want people to think you're watching porn whiles watching this movie . 
0	would be promising if it were a student film .  never seems to know where it's going next ,  as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film .  as a result ,  much repetition and a deadening pace .  there's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world :  it involves the internet ,  phone calls ,  a computer science experiment ,  a suspicious grad student ,  withdrawn behavior ,  red rooms ,  dark stains ,  and _then_ suicides .  good luck figuring out the connections ,  or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely .  characters are barely sketched ,  which could be ok ,  but they're completely uninteresting .  it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario ,  although the conclusion is nonsensical .  weakest moment :  when  " the boss "  sits down to give some incoherent advice . 
0	i caught this on hbo under its category of  " guilty pleasures "  ,  and i would agree that i felt guilty  ( and pleasured )  watching it .  one ,  it's trash ,  and really raunchy trash .  two ,  the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn  " who did it "  ,  you think ,   " so what ?  "  .  however ,  i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie ,  if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times .  do i feel dirty for having watched it ?  yes .  am i sorry i watched it ?  no .  so ,  there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy ,  even when in a poor movie .  sigh ! 
0	i'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity .  the shock to me ,  though ,  is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film .  erika eleniak ,  never anything you'd call a thespian anyway ,  seems to have morphed into anna nicole smith  ( in her big period )  .  daniel bernhardt - i almost shed a tear .  he's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess ,  as seen in the bloodsport series  ( also b movies but ,  if you like martial arts ,  eminently watchable )  .  here ,  he is a shell of his former self - sure ,  he's older ,  but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested  .  .  .  i just don't get it .  don't these people invest ?  william forsythe is another  " heavy "  that i've always liked ,  but his last several roles are what you would call  " mailing it in "  .  i'm not going to even mention mr .  reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway ,  nothing more .  the only winner is andrew divoff ,  as usual a creepy ,  evil ,  pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind !  this is a movie you watch for laughs .  there's nothing else to it . 
1	this is a weird and compelling film .  the topic ,  about the atom bombs created at los alamos ,  nm in the usa and used on japan during the latter part of world war ii ,  is huge ,  and of course deeply disturbing .  the film's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension .  i had never seen the film ,  or was much interested in it i have to admit ,  until i read the book  " smoking in bed :  conversations with bruce robinson .  "  robinson wrote the story and screenplay .  i think the film was better than i expected from reading robinson's point of view in the conversations about it ,  but i can see how he thought it got derailed .  i think paul newman is pretty good ,  but is somehow at bottom ,  miscast .  he's too hollywood .  at one point ,  a big ,  mean-looking guy storms into newman's office and has such a striking presence ,  i immediately thought he should be playing the character newman is playing .  the other lead ,  who plays the head scientist ,  is also fairly good ,  but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part - the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction .  one of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality ,  played by john cusack .  he is oddly affecting throughout ,  and in the end ,  is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200 , 000 japanese people in hiroshima and nagasaki . 
0	schieder delivers a semi-believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president .  the movie just stinks .  with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on .  relegated to late night hbo time schedules ,  this film is not worth seeing at all .  10 minutes into it ,  you are asking yourself why it was written .  40 minutes into it ,  you are wondering why you are watching it .  save the effort and watch a re-run of hee haw or something .  anything is better than this clunker . 
0	like another user i got this cheap - i thought .  85 kroners  ( £8 )  .  although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i - like the other users - first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after .  the story is amazingly thin  ( which is why it might have worked for kids )  ,  but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it .  it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come .  first viewing  ( 1980 )  :  10/10 .  second viewing  ( 2002 )  :  4/10
0	let's get things straight .  i was raised catholic ,  and in a very religious family ,  and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home .  that was useful for two things :  to make a convinced atheist out of me ,  and to give me deep ,  insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas .  and i say :  if a catholic priest witnesses a murder ,  and clearly sees the face of the killer ,  he can report it to the police ,  even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards .  he can not reveal what he's told in confession ,  but he can talk about anything he sees outside that ,  and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut .  so ,  here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie .  and another lie is there's no absolution for murder .  according to the catholic church ,  there's absolution for any sin as long as there's sincere repentance .  so far ,  the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller .   as people frequently say ,  this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles .  hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters  ( i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro's weakest performances in  " the untouchables "  )  and bates' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past .  but above that ,  i think the film would have been much better had real-life ulster native liam neeson  ( back then mostly unknown to big audiences )  played mickey rourke's part .  not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters ,  but he'd make us believe the character as real ,  something rourke just can't .  back in the 80s ,  rourke was not a bad actor  ( afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks )  ,  but he was one of those performers ,  like brad dourif ,  who's as good as the director he works with .  and as a former ira terrorist ,  rourke's acting comes across more like a pimp .  sad to think that ,  had this movie been made just some three to six years later  ( when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi's enjoyable  " darkman "  ,  and superstardom in 1993 with  " schindler's list "  ,  while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been )  ,  liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit  ( rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty ,  but just can't carry this movie along as the lead )  .  yet another missed opportunity ,  and yet another film with the potential of being a classic ,  that became instantly forgettable fare .   ironically enough ,  the often criticized score  ( by underrated composer bill conti )  worked for me .  i didn't find it overly-melodramatic ,  but suitably gritty and beautiful .  it reminded me of howard shore's score for  " the silence of the lambs "  .  here's to mike hodges' talent ,  who made  " get carter "  ,  yes ,  but don't forget he's the mastermind behind  " flash gordon "  as well .  .  .   it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room  ( it shows ,  as some parts are really choppy and confusing ,  and others just don't glue )  and a director's cut is waiting to see the light .  ok ,  but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie ,  as we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there .  4/10 . 
1	a touching story told with tenderness :  awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german pow who is hiding out in her clubhouse .  they discuss their lives and beliefs  ( he's anti-hitler )  ,  she sneaks him food ,  he becomes her only friend and ally .  all this reminded me of the much-better theatrical film  " whistle down the wind "  ,  where hayley mills befriends convict alan bates ,  but you certainly can't fault the direction here ,  which is smooth ,  or the performances ,  which are sterling .  mature in her pre-teen years ,  kristy mcnichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note .  suddenly ,  when the prisoner is discovered  ( and kristy is found out as well )  ,  the movie gets very tough .  her father ,  shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with  " that nazi "  ,  lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before  ( he tells her  " you are dead to me ,  "  which must be devastating for a little girl to hear )  .  the final scenes don't cop out ;  there are no big reunions ,  no hand-holding climaxes .  the girl has to face the world ,  and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors ,  friends ,  and family .  a startling film . 
1	i smiled through the whole film .  the music is great .  the story-telling is great .  it's a wonderful film .  this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties . 
0	this is strictly for pryor fans .  just because he was a great ,  funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a b-movie .  the script is awful ,  it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war .  it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither .    first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic ,  uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point .  .  .  how more can you pander to your audience ?  .  .  .  that prison time is boring ,  unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep .    back in the u . s .  the guy for no real reason at all is considered a  " war hero "  .  yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps .  or are they really ?  we will soon find out .  yawn .  there are annoying clichés :  his sick mother ,  his little daughter he never meets ,  a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc .  it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant .  doesn't work at all .    overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war .  just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian ,  played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly ,  unconvincing ,  unfunny comedy .  but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of dadaist poetry . 
1	i love this movie !  when i saw this movie on tv when i was a kid , it scared the hell out of me . probably because mannequins give me the creeps too . jocelyn jones ( molly ) is an excellent actress . she uses her facial expressions , especially her eyes , at playing terrified . chuck connors is great as mr . slausen . i was happy to see him play such a different roll . the other actors in this movie are great too !  tanya roberts ( becky ) and robin sherwood ( eileen )  are great actresses and i hope to see them in future films , especially jocelyn jones !    so if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing , check this movie out ! 
0	this is the first and as far as i can tell ,  the only completed production of  " heart of darkness "  ever released .  prior to starting on  " citizen kane ,  "  orson welles shot some test footage for a version of  " heart of darkness "  that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called  " pov "  ,  where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow ;  he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors ,  windows ,  water ,  etc .  the film was never made .  the  " pov "  technique was used ,  not too successfully ,  in 1947 in  " the lady in the lake ,  "  with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe .  presumably ,  the coincidence of the two  " marlow ( e )  "  characters is just that .  of course ,  francis coppola's  " apocalypse now "  was based on  " heart of darkness .  "   the short novel  " heart of darkness "  by the polish-born british writer joseph conrad ,  first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 ,  features one of his favorite alter egos ,  ship captain charlie marlow ,  who also narrates the short story  " youth "  and indirectly tells the story of  " lord jim .  "  marlow ,  temporarily out of work ,  decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii's personal fiefdom ,  the cruelly misnamed congo free state .  marlow travels from london to brussels ,  signs on with the company ,  and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony ,  a german named kurtz .  shipments of ivory ,  latex  ( for the production of rubber )  and other products from kurtz's station have ceased ,  and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time .  there are rumors that he has  " gone native .  "  marlow is to investigate ,  take any necessary action ,  and make a report on his return .  he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo ,  is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast ,  and finally sets out upriver to find kurtz's station .  the river ,  the heat ,  the vegetation ,  the wildlife ,  the insects ,  the people ,  all take their toll on his endurance ,  his imagination ,  and his mental resources .  he finds kurtz ill ,  half-mad ,  and close to death .  the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax ,  especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves .  this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics .   this  " heart of darkness "  was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa .  it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage :  actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like .  but the rest of the film was forgettable .  tim roth does his best as marlow ,  but so much about the plot ,  characterizations ,  and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered .  if the aim was to make conrad's story for the screen ,  why didn't they leave it alone ?  it's unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie ,  but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers .  most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz .  he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role .  everything about him is wrong :  his looks ,  his acting style ,  his voice ,  his accent ,  everything .  a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz  ( unlike malkovich ,  an actual german ,  like the character )  .   this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you've read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900 . 
0	the comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies ,  and let me just tell you-it is not a good one .  tom brady  ( the director )  probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films  ( from gridiron gang ,  invincible and even miracle !  to the longest yard and dodgeball-yes dodgeball !  )  and tossing in a couple of sex jokes ,  would be the funniest thing since airplane !  well ,  he was wrong .  they did such a slipshod job ,  you'd thought it was written in a week .  i have found it that if a director loves the genre ,  the movie will be good .  obviously ,  brady does not love the genre he is spoofing .  this movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing ,  so don't see it ! 
1	when i first heard that this movie was going to be made ,  i was very excited to see it .  the ideas to make a movie of this caliber ,  as good as it was ,  must have been very difficult .  i wasn't really sure if anyone could encompass all of the pope's many amazing qualities in a movie ,  but the movie did his memory justice .  in my opinion the most important task was to reveal to the people who the pope started out as .  to his days in poland ,  all the way to his last days in the vatican ,  this movie followed every aspect of his life .  thomas kretschmann ,  the man who played the pope in his adult life and on ,  did a very good job at getting the emotion across .  overall this movie was educational ,  but also very entertaining . 
0	snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo  ( a . j .  castro )  & alma  ( julia ruiz )  cross the boarder into the us ,  they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles .  however alma's family didn't approve of her & brujo's relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes ,  ain't life a b*tch ?  as the snakes pour out of alma's mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment .  .  .   edited & directed by the mallachi brothers  ( although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym ,  peter mervis )  one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap ,  it's as simple as that really .  it seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the samuel l .  jackson cult flick snakes on a plane  ( 2006 )  by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train ,  making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point .  the script by eric forsberg is rubbish ,  for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted .  in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie  ( 2000 )  type spoof .  you know something ,  i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad .  for a start the character's are rubbish & it's impossible to emote with anyone ,  the story is downright awful & makes no sense  ( if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from ?  why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end ?  why did bujo kill the train driver ?  how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles ?  where did that typhoon come from at the end ?  )  ,  it takes itself far too seriously ,  the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake & it's just a very ,  very poor film on just about every level .   director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch .  there's barely any blood or gore ,  there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin ,  someone gets shot & that's about it .  the special effects are rubbish too ,  the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better .  it's not scary ,  there's zero atmosphere & it's a bit of a bore from start to finish .  the real live snakes are a problem too ,  they are just so docile & nonthreatening .  if you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction .   shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget & it show's ,  basically it looks cheap because it is .  the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with .   snakes on a train is rubbish ,  i am sorry but that's how i feel & i don't quite know how else to describe it .  i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train ,  it really is that bad . 
1	i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies .  she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does .  and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie .   however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non-speaking .  i have to single out jamie bartlett and chiwetel ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings .  the whole movie ran almost like a documentary .   i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion .  the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography .   why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award .  it seems to me to hit the high-rating button on all counts .  it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid .  a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit . 
1	 " five fingers of death "  is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema .  as the film that  " broke out "  hk cinema to the west ,  this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre .  it's also a damn entertaining film ,  with hard-hitting ,  non-stop action ,  solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over-the-top 70's era dubbing  (  " oh i see  .  .  .  so you want it the hard way !  !  hwaa !  !  "  )  .    " five fingers "  is an eye-for-an-eye revenge tale  .  .  .  and i mean literally ,  eye for an eye !  it's great to see lo lieh portraying a hero .  he played so many great villains later in his career - including pai mei in the classic fist of the white lotus ,  which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the pai mei of kill bill .   my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd - mine looks like it was a vhs transfer .  overall this is a great film - don't miss it !   bart blackstone film club - hollywood ,  ca

1	the love letter  ( 1999 )  :  starring kate capshaw ,  tom everett scott ,  tom selleck ,  ellen de generes ,  gloria stuart ,  blythe danner ,  jessica capshaw ,  alice drummond ,  bill buell ,  erik jensen ,  margaret ann brady ,  walter covell ,  patrick donnelly ,  lucas hall ,  christian harmony ,  christopher nee ,  breanne smith ,  marilyn rockafellow ,  sasha spielberg ,  jack black .  .  .  .  . director peter chan ,  screenplay maria maggenti .   based on the novel  " the love letter "  by cathleen schine ,  director peter chan's film version ,  released in 1999 ,  was not a big box-office draw ,  not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements .  while it was not as popular in theaters ,  it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on vhs/dvd .  set in a seaport town in the good old usa  ( i forget the exact location )  ,  this is the story of a mysterious ,  passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters ,  each who think the letter is personally addressed to them .  by the end of the film ,  we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town .  the cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on tv and film ,  among them kate capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty helen ,  a bookstore owner ,  comedienne ellen degeneres as her friend/employee janet hall ,  young hottie tom everett scott as johnny ,  the young 20 something guy who falls for the older hellen and an older tom selleck as the firefighter george matthias who must compete with johnny for helen's affections .  there are cameo roles by veteran old hollywood actress gloria stuart ,  who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly rose in  " titanic "   ( 1997 )  and a cameo by kate capshaw's own daughter  ( with husband steven spielberg )  jessica capshaw .  the love triangle is between a middle-aged woman ,  an older man and a young man ,  each of whom feel as passionately for helen as the writer of the mysterious letter .  the conflict lies in helen's indecision .  will she choose the right person  ?  which man has the most to offer her  ?  johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own ,  and is in fact ,  a kind of reminder of what helen was like at her age .  george is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life .  a cultured intellectual ,  he takes helen on an opera date ,  where the tragic death of puccini's ultra-italian heroine tosca moves helen to explosive tears .  there are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town ,  rendered beautifully by cinematographer tami reiker .  the score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs -  "  i've never been in love before "  ,   " i'm in the mood for love "  and  " only the lonely "  .  ellen degeneres as janet hall ,  who is consistently late to her job at helen's bookshop ,  who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy  ,  is simply wonderful .  she has not lost her comedic flair ,  even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on tv or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's tv show  " ellen "  was cancelled because of her  " coming out "  as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show .  here you even find comedian jack black ,  long before he made it big ,  in the bit part of a fisherman .  this is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant ,  about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books ,  letters ,  and music ,  but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship .  this is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit . 
0	first off ,  i am a huge fan of tolkien ,  and as one i will base most of my critic on his books .   the movie is a standard adventure movie ,  well made with nifty special effects ,  nice sound track and fine acting .  now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here .   the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and  " hollywoods "  everything it can ,  numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot ,  the characters are changed from the book also ,  a thing that i think should be punishable  !  what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it ,  i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book ,  and it didn't work here eighter ,  mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best .   as a adventure movie it would rate 7+ / 10 as a adaptation of tolkien it rates 2 / 10  i mean honestly ,  what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford  ?  and as for the comments that this movie  " is the best ever "  i can only say that eighter you are very young ,  or you havent seen good movies .  .  .   peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings . 
0	this movie sucked .  the problem was not with the cast .  i think the cast was great ,  lots of good talent ,  lots of great acting .  but the script was terrible !  it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his improv .  and that is what he does best ,  but it just didn't work here .  the script was hard to follow ,  the story was non-sensical ,  and scenes were random and lacked direction .  also ,  much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out .  it was a good effort ,  but as max says ,  they missed it by that much !  i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the imdb .  obviously ,  the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb .  if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews ,  it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users .   this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work .  i loved steve carrell in anchor man ,  and i like his comedy and style .  but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie .  yes ,  i had a couple of light moments ,  a couple of chuckles ,  but no real laughs .  nothing that struck me at all .   spoiler alert !  one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape .  he uses his special swiss army knife .  .  . but instead of just using the blade of the knife ,  he tries to shoot the binding with his miniature crossbow .  and as the crossbow miss-fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again  ( almost putting out his eye )  ,  max doesn't give up or try the blade instead .  .  . no ,  he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow .  what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow ?  it seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the bindings .  it just made absolutely no sense .   that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie .  they were ridiculous ,  poorly thought out ,  poorly motivated ,  and made of pure nonsense .  and that was truly distracting .   as i said ,  this movie was a big let-down ,  and i recommend you avoid it .  a note to the imdb :  you should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving .  it degrades the authenticity of the site . 
1	the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible .  i've seen a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly ,   " sensory overload .  "  the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to  " subtly "  explain it .  the creatures in this movie are also very interesting .  you don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through .  overall ,  a very entertaining movie . 
1	everyone told me to see  " cactus flower ,  "  and i finally did .  what a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a sunday night/dreading monday morning .  matthau and hawn were good ,  but ingrid bergman really made this movie -- after all ,  it was really about her .  the truly great actors can do anything ,  and miss bergman proves it .  she shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career .  the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching .  even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion ,  i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox .  thankfully ,  she made out  ( no pun intended )  much better .   ;  ) 
1	apparently a b movie  .  .  . b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget  " a "  pictures today .  modern-day movies aimed at young women ,  surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self-serving behavior .  .  .  or increase the self-esteem of young girls who don't conform to  " feminine "  standards .   ( after all ,  criticizing the fake and flashy ,  like this movie does ,  ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls *not* being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty .  )    laraine day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who  " bounds "  into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt .  she bonds with robert cummings due to similar interests ,  a shared sense of humour ,  and her honesty ,  loyalty and good friendship ,  which he gradually comes to value over the superficial  " charms "  of her selfish glamour-girl sister  ( who only brings out his own selfish ,  reckless playboy tendencies )  .   although laraine is outwardly beautiful as well ,  it's refreshing to see inner beauty valued more ,  and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship .  i wish young girls  ( and guys )  were getting this kind of down-to-earth message today .   maybe if hollywood returns to making  " b "  movies again ,  with modest budgets ,  and tries to be content with modest profits .  .  .  what am i saying ?  sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller-scale ,  would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him .  that's crazy talk .   please ,  somebody invent a time machine already !  i belong in 1940 .   i'd rate this movie higher ,  but the ending is a bit too abrupt ,  and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert cummings' change of heart .   ( i like the fact that b movies are short & snappy ,  not bloated & self-indulgent ,  but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes .  )  also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their family .  .  . or be so forgiving of the one who caused it .  i mean ,  i guess it's *nice* ,  but a little more grieving or bitterness would've been only natural .  maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss ,  to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure *we* forgive those involved in the death - since it's just a plot device anyway ,  not the real point of the film .  still strange though . 
1	this movie was definitely scripted with ff vii fans only in mind .  i am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan .  from a visual and technical standpoint this movie is just as good as  " the spirits within "  ,  if not better ,  but from a story standpoint ,  i was pretty lost .  one major plot weakness that stood out to me was the scene where  " all "  of the children dying of geostigma were brought to the healing  " reunion "  by the three jenovites .  all told there were about 15 kids in all .  .  .  hmmmm .  .  .  i thought that this geostigma was an illness of pandemic proportions .  .  .  i understand why they did it that way  ( time ,  budget , cpu )  ,  but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to collect all of those who had jenova cells so that jenova could be reincarnated .  the subtitle version that we had  ( some fan sub from the internet )  was a pretty direct translation and therefore probably added to my confusion .   it did prick my interest in ff vii however ,  and i spent a few hours on the ff vii wiki reading about the main characters and the plot .  once i read the advent children wiki ,  things made a lot more sense .  if you are a video game or sci-fi fan this movie is a pretty good flick ,  but like a previous review said ,  it comes off like a 90 minute fight scene .  you never really get to know any of the characters ,  and the story does just seem to jump from scene to scene without much explanation ,  even though some explanation just might be required .  thank goodness for wikpedia . 
0	'bloody birthday' is an odd and ,  at times ,  humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'the good son' .   set in a small californian town ,  three babies are born at the height of an eclipse ,  where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions .  ten years later ,  our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree ,  doing away with parents ,  siblings ,  teachers and anyone else who irritates them .  only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them .  there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go !   for a slasher film ,  it's very tame in terms of violence and gore ,  which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to .  instead ,  it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns ,  knives and crossbows .  the main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth .   'bloody birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick ,  with few scares and little blood ,  but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers ,  it is a bit unique in that way .  one to watch if there's nothing else on . 
1	my girlfriend ,  as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square ,  after the movie ,  says :  if they didn't speak english and they didn't show the stadium ,  you could have thought this was the slums of a south american city or some other slum anywhere in the world , not queens in nyc .   ramin bahrani is  ,  right now ,  my official hero ,  because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american ,  but the real face of america .   ramin bahrani's movies are like ladri di biciclette ,  or germania anno zero ,  or roma citta' aperta .  chop shop is reality turned into a movie ,  is more realistic than a documentary ,  in fact i think ramin bahrani's movies are more realistic than documentaries .  this is a great movies ,  but don't expect any car chase or shooting .  this movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest  ,  richest country in the world . 
1	this may be one of the best movies i have ever seen .  it has anything but a trite plot ,  and leaves one wondering which way it will go next .  it is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth ,  youth who are interested in more than immediate gratification ,  youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others . 
1	some days ago ,  in rome ,  a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping .  a romanian girl ,  who had seen everything ,  reported what happened .   therefore ,  it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania ,  generalizing them as criminals ,  everyone ,  indiscriminately .   i'm only 15 ,  but i thought :  what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people ?  how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty ?  yesterday evening i finally saw nuovomondo ,  and my question had an answer .  when you have only a donkey and some goats ,  those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables ,  makes such an impression .   nuovomondo is really a must-see film .  it balances an ethereal symbolism  ( milk rivers ,  glances' play ,  hard and rocky mountains ,  the name and character lucy/luce )  and a cruel realism  ( the mass of hopeful people on the ship ,  the procedures at ellis island )  .  there's a mixed cast ,  going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato ,  till a bitter and smashing aurora quattrocchi as the mother .  but was it really so hard to enter in the new world ? 
1	after the return of  " horror movies "   ( come on scream isn't scary !  )  i didn't have very high hopes for this low-budget three story horror movie .  but i was positively surprised !  man this is scary !  !  !  the first 2 stories are simply brilliant .  the first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their rv ,  when they bump into a fierce .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ( watch the movie )  !  the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl ,  who is home alone for one night .  .  .  .  i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary .  i promise you .  the last story isn't scary but atleast not bad .  it's about a biker and a ghosthouse .  in fact the stories are based on real urban legends ( i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too )  . rent this movie it is good !  !  !  i'd say i'ts the scariest three-short-story-horror-movie ever made ! 
0	the adventures of sebastian cole is about a boy named sebastian  ( adrian grenier )  who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point ,  given he actually puts effort into it .  this movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing ,  the adventure years ,  hence the title and the previous quote .  in it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves ,  drugs ,  and sex .  .  . changes .  yeah ,  there's a slight twist here that is very interesting ,  and that is that sebastian's step dad  ( clark gregg )  very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex-change that has a huge impact on sebastian's family and his relationship with his step-dad .   clark gregg plays hank/henrietta ,  sebastian's step-father and is very good in the part ,  very believable without being over the top ,  which is a route this film could've taken rather easily .  thankfully they didn't .  adrien grenier ,  who i'm only familiar with from entourage ,  is also very good in his part as sebastian ,  and together ,  he and gregg have a great relationship on screen .  it's always quite engaging to watch these guys  (  ?  )  relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times .   and that's the best of what this film has to offer .  unfortunately ,  it brings with it some mediocre camera work ,  direction ,  and cinematography .  it's not bad ,  but it's a far cry from being good ,  or memorable in the slightest .  the characters are also thinly written ,  and it's clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out .  the only truly fascinating character through and through is clark gregg's hank/henrietta .  i've already said grenier did well acting-wise ,  but the character of sebastian is not only not engaging ,  but is completely unlikeable .  i don't honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does .  he mopes ,  whines ,  cheats ,  lies ,  and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker .  it'd be different if he was maybe a side-character or comic relief ,  but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously ?  come on .   and i don't really hold it against this film ,  but i just want to say .  .  . pick a different song in all these films ,  hollywood !  no more  " where is my mind "  by the pixies ,  we all know it's a good song ,  stop using it in every other film !   i feel like i could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart ,  but in all honesty i didn't hate it .  i just didn't really care for it ,  and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone .  the adventures of sebastian cole isn't a bad or boring film ,  it's just not a very good or engaging one either .  it's very uneven and the script could've used quite a bit of work .  i guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it ,  and it worked .  .  . if that writer put out pieces of fiction that i wouldn't want to read . 
0	let's just say that it might be the worst movie i've ever seen .  on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling reservoir dogs .  i fell for it hook ,  line ,  and sinker .  this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this .  it's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at . 
1	caught this flick as one of a five-for-$5 deal from a local video store ,  and it was a most pleasant surprise .  it's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up .  they tell each other these stories to kill time ,  and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o .  henry-esque ending that left me gleeful .  a real discovery .  blood  ( and plenty of it )  ,  breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely .  .  . jacinda barrett is worth the price of admission alone .  this one is a keeper--jim bob says check it out .   oddly enough ,   " pumpkinhead "  was one of our five choices too ,  and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes  " campfire tales "  .  i'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one .  joyeux samhain ! 
1	when the trailer for accepted first came up ,  many people began to get excited about seeing it .  .  .  really excited .  who could blame them ,  it looked like fun .  but that's exactly the thing .  people went into accepted looking for a good movie ,  but if you think about it ,  accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie .  it's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given .  that being said ,  for those of you who expected a great film ,  you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one .  think that ,  and you will truly enjoy the film  ( because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic .  )  bottom line :  watch the movie ,  and have fun ,  but don't look for anything groundbreaking . 
1	it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer .  while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves ,  i embrace  " uzumaki "  for its irreverence .  there is a plot ,  it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer .  this is a film that invites numerous interpretations ,  as all great art does - however ,  this film is also very entertaining ,  making it a rare film experience .  it's simultaneously provocative and fun . 
1	how important is the director ,  anyway ?  in this film ,  made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts ,  asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director ,  william greaves .  it is an important work ,  as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking ,  organizing ,  and setting the scene ;  it reveals the role of the crew ,  something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief ;  and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match/don't match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality  ( if at all )  .   the documentary ,  or pseudo-documentary ,  or fictional narrative  ( whichever you prefer ,  via your interpretations of the themes )  has its brain in the over-educated ,  over-intellectual crew ,  its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions ,  and its heart in the director ,  who stands in as the desire to portray ,  to represent ,  to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it .  it's a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities .  it's a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously ,  just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective .   it's an important work ,  and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film-making should watch and understand .  it ,  like many experimental films ,  has no real mass-audience appeal--it's not for them .  it's for the industry ,  and its for the 60s ,  asking what to do with a group-effort medium that still relies on a single  " voice "  and  " author "  .   --polarisdib
1	i absolutely fell in love with  " living in a big way "  when i first saw it !  reason #1 is because i love ,  adore ,  and am a huge fan of gene kelly .  he was such a wonderful dancer ,  actor ,  and choreographer .  not to mention his extremely handsome looks and his sensual personality .  i love his role in this movie .  he was such a gentleman .  this movie showcased his wonderful talent for acting .  i enjoyed marie macdonald as well .  it was my first time of ever seeing or knowing anything about her ,  and this excellent movie made me a fan of her's as well .  actually ,  the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great .  the humor between the butler ,  " everette hanover smythe "  ,  and the father ,  mr .  morgan ;  mrs .  morgan's courtroom humor ,  and especially grandmother morgan's immediate attachment to ,  and concern for  " leo gogarty .  "  and gene's number  " fido and me "  is adorable .  the opening dance number with gene and marie is very nice too .  i would recommend that anyone see this movie .  it will truly remain dear to your heart forever .  or at least it has to mine .  and you'll fall in love with gene all over again .  i rate it my #2 favorite gene kelly movie ,  and i've seen and own a quite many of his movies .  they're a part of my daily routine !  so trust me when i tell you ,  you'll love this movie !  watch it and enjoy !  ! 
0	when a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger ,  less known brother stars in it ,  you know it's not gonna' be a real good one .   " soultaker "  is a low budget ,  silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death .  it's a stupid movie ,  but it is pretty entertaining ,  and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity .   the plot in the film is very small ,  and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be .  joe estevez isn't much of an actor ,  so luckily for the audience ,  he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking .  this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise ,  considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher .  4 characters ,  each dies one at a time .  .  . will any live ?  who really cares .  though it sounds like i hated this ,  i didn't .  i just didn't like it very well ,  but i was interested through most of it ,  so i guess that counts for something .   my rating :  * 1/2 out of **** .  90 mins .  pg-13 for language ,  violence and nudity . 
1	to be honest fellow imdb reviewers ,  i enjoyed this show a lot .  the reason ?  well ,  it didn't try to be more than it is ;  i mean ,  a sitcom with regular expectations ,  with a well known and repeated plot ,  funny and talented actors ,  and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience .   this is what grown ups is all about :  trying to be mature but in a funny way .   jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty ,  and hilarious sex oriented jokes .  the humor is very 90's without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success .  it got stuck in the 90's .   oh and mrs .  ribisi was really funny and perky .   my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass !  not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia . 
0	this is by far the most vapid ,  idiotic ,  insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air ,  and this is coming from someone who remembers  " san pedro beach bums "  .   my wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a  " walk "  .  the end result was straight out of monty python's  " ministry of silly walks "  sketch .  i couldn't laugh hard enough .   and then there's the ubiquitous ms .  banks  ( as in laughing all the way to the .  .  .  )  .  she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left  " the view "  .  as if modeling was doing great things for mankind .  please .  i've never found her attractive ,  and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth .   someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women . 
1	i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie .  the acting is astonishing ,  the movie itself is powerful and clear ,  and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth .   this is an important movie .  it could be profoundly transformative .   i would pay good money never ,  ever to see it again .  because it *is* so good and so complex ,  it is extremely difficult to watch .  i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment ;  the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important .  those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle .   but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once .  preferably with others ,  so you can talk to each other ,  and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie . 
1	i think this movie is underrated .  to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air .  some people complain about the implausibility of the plot ,  overlong sequences and lack of sex  ( the latter being ,  i believe ,  the main reason for  " implausibility "  ;  and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty ?  !  )  ;  but it's just not their thing ,  and good for them if they can't relate to the story .  the performances are great ;  i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies .  the emotions are genuine .  the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety .  and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie . 
1	fame was released in the u . s .  a year before i was born ;  i was too young to ever remember the original version of fame- and yet i heard and read numerous things about it .  such as the fact that it spawned a tv series and that its soundtrack was led by the irene cara ,  giogio moroder hit ,  'fame' .   fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film .  the lives ,  the struggles ,  the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers .   the performances were great ,  yet one which caught my eye in particular was gene anthony ray ,  who played the troublesome yet promising leroy .  angry ,  frustrated and at first rude ,  his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too .  irene cara was good as coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch- ,  as well as paul mccrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in new york ,  after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay .  ralph played by barry miller was interesting but at times ,  his character did grate on my nerves .   the choreography was excellent ,  there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching .  another scene that was great was when the 'fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of new york and danced wildly and without a care in the world .  it was a street jam like no other .   the only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is debbie allen- she later became a producer ,  director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as everybody hates chris and the fresh prince of bel air .  paul mccrane later went on to star alongside peter weller in the movie ,  'robocop' ,  where he played a villain and e . r .  as the judgemental ,  obnoxious doctor romano .   british director alan parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance ,  act ,  sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles .   throughout the duration of the movie ,  we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year ,  all the way up to graduation in new york's high school for the arts .   fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely not for everyone .   i for one enjoyed it because i have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because i am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work ,  commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents .  therefore ,  if you are an aspiring dancer ,  actor- or just someone who is creative ,  you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college/school in real life ,  then that is a completely different matter altogether .   the 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly ,  it virtually pales by comparison .    as for the original fame ,  almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie ,  nonetheless .   it's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic ,  in line with other 80s dance hit movies ,  such as footloose and flashdance ,  fame hits the spot .  isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'f' ?    gritty ,  moving and intriguing ,  this one is worth a watch . 
1	i have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie ,  and i understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about ponyo ,  whether it be the story line ,  animation ,  dialogue ,  and so forth .  and i believe the most simple way i can answer to this ,  is that it's a movie for a much ,  much younger age bracket .  an age bracket much younger than that of tonarino totoro  ( my neighbor totoro )  .   being a miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site ,  i expected the wonderful animation ,  music composition ,  complex story telling ,  the great steady development of characters ,  how the story intertwines with today's society ,  etc etc etc of a typical miyazaki film that we grew up with .  and to tell you the truth ,  i didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes  ( with twenty minutes left in the movie )  ,  that this movie is not for the deep thinkers and hard core ghibli-ists ,  but for the toddlers and youngins' and happy go lucky japanese people .  also ,  i believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation ;  straight-up grass roots ghibli studios style .    the fact that a villain is not present really surprised me ,  other than the father and maybe that crazy-ass typhoon .  but other than that ,  this movie is just plain fun ;  to stimulate a young one's mind ,  and to make happy good time feeling .  that's all .    the animation goes back to the old-school mid-80s early-90s era of miyazaki's films ,  where very specific detail wasn't a big focus ,  unlike mononoke hime  ( princess mononoke )  and the latter .  i admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when i first watched ghibli movies like tonarino totoro when i was a child .  the reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids ,  and a lot of studio ghibli's body language is very noticeable .  studio ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators ,  but it probably won't take the ritual ghibli-ist in awe .   the japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very ,  very relative from what japanese kids and mothers would say and act .  the music if very hoppy and  " fluffy "  i guess you could say  ( similar to totoro )  from beginning to end .  even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive .   in the end this movie is one of a kind .  just about every aspect of this movie is for children .  and i waited a whole 80 mins to realize that .  quite frankly ,  i have never seen a movie told or shown it the way miyazaki did .  it's refreshing to see that studio ghibli can still tell a story for a wider ,  and much different scale of audience ,  and still keep that trademark ghibli impression . 
0	i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan .  i figured it couldn't be that bad .  boy was i wrong !  at the 15 minute mark  ,  i was begiing the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store ,  but they refused .  they swore it had to get better .   they were wrong !  this movie was lacking everything .  the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock !  the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it .  none of the characters interacted very well with each other .  ice-t gives one of his worst performances here .   after watching footage of the wrong plane ,  bad guys standing up to get shot ,  and clips being emptied and missing everything ,  i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete .  the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel .  space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say .   i didn't finish this movie and hated it .  i don't want to finish this movie .  this is slow suicide .  i could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture i put it through . 
0	it was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic ,  i mean ,  come on ,  like a pop star would just show up at a public high school and fall in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him ?  come on ,  people !   everyone but the lead girl were completely horrendous at acting .  the dialog was cheesy ,  the premise was stupid ,  and the camera work was poorly done .  i felt like i was watching a badly made home video .    i feel as if i've wasted almost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back .    i don't have anything else to say ,  except that i'd rather punch myself in the face multiple times ,  than watch this movie again . 
0	the gate to hell has opened up under moscow .  a priest ,  played by vincent gallo ,  goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway .  wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic .  good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting .  i've watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms .  nothing is clear and honestly i didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved  ( second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film .  )  the idea is really good ,  the performances are fine ,  the script goes nowhere .  take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this . 
1	another asian horror movie packed with intense ,  and creepy moments .  another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot ,  which is here as well .  major spoiler warning !   the movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself .  the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father .  all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father .  then it hits you ,   " your sister has been dead for years now "  it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well . as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother  ( actually the sister's alter ego )  is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in !  i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there .   finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack .  very creepy !  7 out of 10
0	this movie was a complete waste of time .  the soundtrack was bad ,  story was lame and predictable ,  and the acting was terrible .  one of the worst 25 movies i have ever seen .  after the first ten minutes ,  the rest of the film was completely obvious . 
1	ruthless evil warlord samanosuke  ( superbly played to the hateful hilt by yutaro gomi )  cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village .  the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy samanosuke and his wicked minions .  director kimiyoshi yasudo and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale :  there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place  ( it's specifically set in feudal japan )  ,  the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable ,  the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto ,  the special effects are fine and impressive ,  the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute ,  and majin's last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively ,  exciting ,  and more than a little scary .  moreover ,  the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark ,  harsh and gritty world .  this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good .  veteran composer akira ifukube supplies a typically rich ,  robust and rousing score .  fujio morita's sharp ,  moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye .  the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances ,  with especially praiseworthy work by jun fujimaki as the valiant ,  protective kogenta and tatsuo endo as mean henchman gunjuro .  highly recommended . 
1	i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas .   naturally here in the uk we are about 2/3rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3  (  via other means  )  i'm still glued every friday at 9pm .   from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd ,  yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october .   so why do i love this show so much ,  well i have to agree with the last poster .  .  .  .  james caan ,  i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around ,  i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline .  .  .  .  do'h no way !  !  !  i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft ,  i also preferred the tough take no sh*t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 & 2 ,  he seems to have mellowed out .   as i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members josh duhamel/danny ,  james lesure/mike ,  vanessa marcil/sam ,  nikki cox/mary ,  molly sims/delinda all contribute well ,  even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline ,  harry groener as gunther ,  dean caine as casey ,  mitchell longley as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one .   this show has everything ,  drama ,  action ,  suspense ,  laughs ,  romance ,  glitz's ,  glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's .   many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4 . 
1	 .  .  .  .  . and it's a good one ,  too .  in fact ,  this may be one of the best studies of sexual repression ever made .  it's extremely well-acted and has some downright chilling moments .  an often overlooked film in clint eastwood's filmography ,  and atypical of him ,  to be sure ,  but if you're willing to accept him in such an ambiguous role ,  it's certainly very gripping .   ( *** ) 
0	with nbc's  " thank god you're here "  ,  the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abc's improv sitcom ,   " who's line is it anyway ?  "  in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind .  in the nbc show ,  dave foley and co-host dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with  " thank god you're here .  "  it takes itself far too seriously  ( why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before )  ,  both co-hosts seem less then enthused .  after watching the continuously sub-par ,  unfunny attempts by the actors to solicit some laughs ,  i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires ,  or whether they ,  too ,  are improvising .  expect this time slot filler to be a very short-lived one . 
0	i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show ,  and most of them i was forced to watch .  and i did not like the episodes i saw .  what happened to dan schneider ?  after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh ,  why did he decide to create a stupid show like this ?  my problem is not just with dan ,  it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy ,  were they drunk that day ,  or what's the problem ?  drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy ,  but it's way better than zoey 101 .  the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show ,  let's just hope the pregnancy of you know who will affect the show ,  or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled . 
1	  horror movie time ,  japanese style .  uzumaki/spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish .  a fun freakfest at that ,  but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror .  the story is difficult to summarize succinctly :  a carefree ,  normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w/ extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals .  the spirals are everywhere ,  in the air ,  clouds ,  dirt and everyday objects .  the spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them .  oh ,  another thing ,  people are randomly turning into snails .  why ?  who knows or cares ,  people are turning into snails ,  that's enough for me .  this wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do .  uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl  ( like a snail might !  )  rather than to jolt .  a favorite scene :  a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long ,  thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post ,  across the sheets ,  over the pillow and into her sleeping ear .  i cringed and curled my toes .  uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well .  for example ,  a man is obsessed w/ spirals ,  he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins ,  he commits spiral suicide inside the washer .  the last shot we see of him is w/ his body all coiled & rubber like ,  a human flesh spiral w/ a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer .  a bizarre image .  uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which adds to its charm and fun .  i love horror movies like this .  it's not about killing ,  a la slasher films ,  it's about a force of evil  ( the spirals !  )  taking over you and trying to kill you ,  force you to kill others .  films like uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that
0	katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch .  kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick  ( named trigger hicks !  )  ,  but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario .  constantly-smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes trigger's first crush .  .  . but alas ,  he's married !  no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula ,  based on a play and brought to the screen by r . k . o .  with too broad a hillbilly flourish .  it is ungodly ,  and just about unwatchable .  *1/2 from ****
0	overall it was a watchable movie .  i didn't pause it or stop it to come back to it--a clear sign of a boring movie--so it passed the first test .  best of all ,  it got into the story fast ,  no boring unneeded back story for the characters .   it will never go down as a great movie .  nor as a great b movie .  i would recommend this movie to slasher/horror fans who don't mind straight to video releases .   unlike some movies of it's ilk ,  there is no nudity ,  only moderate language and rather subdued gore .  there is violence though .  the deaths were rather dry and unimaginative sadly .  the computer special effects were actually pretty good .  the way the 'creature' wielded his chains in some scenes reminded me of 'spawn' and the 'ghost rider' comic books .   a little pet peeve .  .  . it's set in lousinia ,  but no one seems to talk with any accent .  i had to watch the credits to even realize it was filmed in lousinia .   like most low budget movies ,  there are small goofs in the filming .  lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs .  for example in one scene it went from mid afternoon to pitch black in seconds .  .  . during a short car ride .  the other instance was the stunt double for the 'creature' didn't have on the 'creature' makeup when falling out of the tow truck .  .  . it also looks like he's wearing a shirt in the scene .   in summary ,  i didn't hate this movie but i also didn't love it .  i probably will never rent it again ,  but if a buddy owned it ,  i may watch it again in a few years . 
0	if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie .  if you are renting it for whatever other reason .  .  .  . dont !  .  .  .  . this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen .  the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason .  i cant even write about this movie anymore .  .  . get it away from me !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
1	i've seen jimmy stewart in all the regular roles ,  but the  " spirit of st .  louis "  was reported to be one of his favorites .  a poor box-office performer when released ,  this film has been largely forgotten today .  telling the well-known story of lindberg's famous flight in 1927 ,  stewart seems to be badly miss-cast at first ,  and his well known voice never lets you forget who you're watching ;  it feels like george baily all over again .  but stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right ,  so before long you don't care anymore that stewart was 20 years older than the man he's portraying .  stewart's lindberg is so gosh-darn ,  all-american ,  apple-pie likable that you get caught up in the story ,  and you realize that stewart intended to portray lindberg with all of the aw-shucks ,  yankee-know-how he could muster up .  lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the u . s .  ,  and stewart seems determined to keep up appearances .   flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along ,  and i was struck by the subtle references to faith that were scattered through the film ;  lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly ,  only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs ,  or lindberg refusing to carry a proffered st .  christopher medal to save weight on the plane ,  only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after he'd crossed the atlantic .  for me ,  this is a film not about a man's epic journey into the unknown ,  but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel . 
0	addle-brained stupidity that the cartoon  " bullwinkle "  made fun of a quarter-century beforehand ,  no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie  ( the manchurian candidate )  without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder .  the acting barely registers on the cable-access tv scale ,  the plot is less nuanced than an old  " sgt .  rock "  comic ,  and only boris j .  badanov-style  " bad guy "  mustaches are missing from the commies .  this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad ,  too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs . 
0	aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  when does the hurting stop ?  that's what i said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked .  this film nearly sapped all the life out of me and i have sat through some really bad movies .  coming from a true puppet master fan ,  i would expect to hear myself say this ,  but it's true .  the plot is inane ,  the special effects awful ,  the sound track the most benawl ,  infernal tootling i have ever heard .  oh !  i almost forgot about the acting ,  it was so bad that i forgot it was there at all ,  nuff said .  the only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out-act all but guy rolfe himself ( he is the puppetmaster ) and although you can see their wires and strings ,  they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of retro-puppet master .  in closing ,  pm7 is recomended for true fanatics who happen to be masochists .   roach  
1	i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie :  beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside ,  and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty .  watch this with your children ,  especially your young daughters- velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls .  this was one of my daughter's favorite films .   the story is based on a best selling book by enid bagnold about a girl ,  velvet ,  whose whole life is her horse ,  pi ,  and about her single-minded pursuit of her  " impossible "  dream .  i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first-time viewers .  she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village .   this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star ,  and to watch the film is to understand why .  she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty- trusting ,  passionate ,  innocent- she is the emotional core of the movie .   mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi ,  the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day ,  stays ,  and helps velvet train the pi .  this is one of his finest performances .  also standing out is anne revere as velvet's mother in an academy award winning role .  her strong ,  loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams :   " we're alike .  i ,  too ,  believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life .  "    i heartily recommend this very sweet ,  very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age . 
0	a bare-faced rip-off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes .  the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this .  lambert is wooden ,  as always  ( his moments of 'emotion' are laughable ,  as is his accent )  .  the 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals ,  and by the end we're simply immune to flesh ,  rotting and otherwise .  altogether a real mess . 
0	this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the  " kharis "  series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived  ( hell ,  we even get a singing barmaid/hostess !  )  :  peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films ,  and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings ;  kurt katch ,  then ,  is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka :  the latter ,  in the form of virginia christine  ( later a much-used character actress )  gets her most substantial 'role' and ,  indeed ,  the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series .  unfortunately ,  here too ,  chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka ,  as i've said ;  his mummy  ( to which he returned most often at universal - apart ,  naturally ,  from his signature role of the wolf man !  )  remains ,  without a doubt ,  his least memorable monster for the studio . 
1	the vietnam war era is certainly far before my time ,  but it has always interested me ,  and i have seen many films about it .  all of the others i'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle .  when i read a description of  " the war at home ,  "  i found the concept intriguing .  no vietnam war movie i'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with .    one night ,  while flipping through channels ,  the movie aired on the sundance channel .  i set down the remote and settled back to watch it .  i did not move from my seat during the entire two hours ;  it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next .    this movie made me a huge fan of emilio estevez .  i had enjoyed him very much as billy the kid in the  " young guns "  movies ,  but i never saw anything he did afterward .  emilio proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting .    the pacing of the movie is done extremely well .  i am hard-pressed to think of a point where it drags .    what amazes me is that it didn't get an oscar or any real recognition when it came out .  it is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again .  definitely worth seeing . 
0	 .  .  . and i bought a vampire motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together .  some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable  ( like norman j . warren's inseminoid )  ,  some 'bad' films are just bad  ( like kent bateman's headless eyes )  ,  but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution .  a lot of people think troma's terror firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece ,  for example ,  but i'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck .  then there's john carpenter's dark star .  yes ,  it's quaint ,  and certainly a product of its time ,  but as a film it's only two notches above worthless .  this no-budget british black comedy-horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone ,  with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter flicks  ( among them psychomania ,  horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker )  ,  but due to dismal performances by second-string tv actors  ( the leading lady looks like amy winehouse )  ,  a script that appears to have been written on the back of a peeled beermat by two 'lads' with no understanding of how film comedy works ,  dean friedman's  ( intentionally ?  )  dire elevator-rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre ,  the net result is a film that can only be laughed at ,  rather than with .  if your idea of whoopee is anthropomorphic turds ,  chinese takeaways called fu king and references to long-forgotten tv ads ,  you'll enjoy this one ,  but don't expect too much . 
1	well i've enjoy this movie ,  even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation .  i didnt understood at this time if the  " punishment park "  has exist in the past ,  but i think the matter isnt really here .   you have to look at this movie in a different manner .  it shows how much violence you can find in our world .  it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it .  if anyone refuse to  " take his responsabilities "  then you will be thrown out of our society .  .  . all our history is made by wars ,  we should never forget this .  in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that ,  maybe ,  we will change and understand that our  " intellectual skills "  have improve .  so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problems .   in 2 words this movie is a must see ,  maybe it will help us to accept the truth .  .  . 
1	alfred hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his best-regarded films ;  made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures ,  suspicion and shadow of a doubt ,  it's generally regarded as a lesser effort .  i agree that the later film is groundbreaking ,  drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time ,  but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion ;  its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players ,  bob cummings and priscilla lane .   in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america ,  literally ,  as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused .  cummings is very youthful here ,  and quite engaging .  his boyishness  ( but not immaturity )  perfectly suits the character he is portraying ,  and seems appropriate ,  as the director ,  though middle-aged ,  was in the process of reinventing himself ,  and an older ,  more established star might have thrown things off .  priscilla lane's spunky heroine ,  which not a typical type for the director ,  was very much a common type in american films at the time ;  and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time .  i cannot imagine older ,  more solid types , --cooper and stanwyck for instance--doing any better ,  as they would have ,  between them ,  carried ,  well ,  too much baggage .   as is the norm in hitchcock's films ,  nothing is as it appears .  where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early .  though cummings is an accused arsonist ,  we know that he is innocent .  the villains become apparent fairly soon ;  and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies .  what pleasures there are are incidental ,  and here the master does not disappoint .  there is an interesting ,  tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks ,  who help cummings elude capture .  in another scene ,  reminiscent of james whale's bride of frankenstein ,  cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man ,  who ,  as it turns out ,  is lane's uncle .  was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade ?  whatever the case ,  these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety ,  which ,  when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads ,  makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man ,  still learning his craft .   the film's later scenes ,  in new york ,  are more suspenseful and typical of the director ,  as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along .  in the end i find it a satisfying work ;  and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor ,  neither does the movie have one .  it is deliberately lightweight ,  and i suspect semi-experimental ;  an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off ,  in an american setting ,  the sort of story he had done so well in england .  he succeeded admirably .  the next logical step :  shadow of a doubt ,  a film in which the main character travels east to west ,  and with a wholly different set of values and plans .    
0	julie andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama ,  but if she approaches her role with aplomb ,  she's alone in doing so .  blake edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesn't know what tone to aim for ,  and rock hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle .  musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 ,  and elephantine productions like  " star !  "  and this film really tarnished andrews' reputation ,  leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until  " the tamarind seed "  came along .  i've always thought julie andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady ;  her strong voice could really command attention ,  and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive .  husband/director edwards seems to realize this ,  but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario .  screenwriter william peter blatty isn't a good partner for edwards ,  and neither man has his heart in this material .  beatty's script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease .  *1/2 from ****
1	i saw this movie on a fluke . i was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie . i gave it a chance not expecting much . the promotional movie posters i've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all .   the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal . i'll leave it there . the movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun . if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film . jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician .   tenacious d is definitely worth a look ! 
1	how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie ?   the plot is very much like that jody foster thing ,  sommersby ,  only not as good .  nicole was great .  .  .  . jude was adequate .  they didn't give him many lines .  .  . is there a reason for that ?  generally ,  he's a pretty good actor .  she's so elegant ,  his character is so country bumpkin .  it makes one wonder what they see in each other .   romance between two such was only successful in lady chatterly's lover .   i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long .  they could have told the story in two hours .   the story is good .  good locations ,  good filming .  the character actors were great . 
1	the crew of an american submarine discover it's hell below while fighting in the adriatic in 1918 .   although nearly forgotten ,  this excellent war film still delivers solid entertainment ,  thanks to a literate script ,  superior performances and highly believable action scenes .   robert montgomery & walter huston play submarine officers under the stress of war who quickly are at odds with each other ,  with dramatic and tragic results .  since montgomery is in love with huston's daughter ,  madge evans in a well-played role ,  the situation becomes even more complicated ,  both on shore and beneath the waves .  the viewer is torn between the two strong characters ,  one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by the rules .   robert young makes an effective appearance as montgomery's buddy .  sterling holloway creates a brief ,  vivid ,  portrait of a doomed seaman .   eugene pallette as the torpedo master & jimmy durante as the sub's cook make for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with plenty of laughs .  durante's nose comes in for lots of ribbing and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with british tars .   movie mavens will recognize babe london as an obese italian miss ;  maude eburne as the wife of a british admiral & paul porcasi as an italian admiral - all uncredited .   mgm has given the film absolutely first-class production values ,  with the undersea sequences especially well produced .  both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately portrayed .  other moments of unexpected drama  ( montgomery & miss evans caught on top of a stalled ferris wheel during an air raid )  and hilarity  ( durante boxing a kangaroo )  are expertly threaded into the fabric of the movie to provide a totally satisfying viewing experience . 
1	look ,  this movie is obscure ,  brilliant ,  and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary .  i suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin ;  nevertheless ,  we could only pray for the chance to see this one on dvd .  i would say that it even beats the great phatasm .  if you like a dark movie ,  with plenty of spooky imagery ,  look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be . 
1	hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries .  this movie has a cast that includes robert young ,  randolph scott ,  dean jagger and john carradine .  scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger's life .  jagger works for western union ,  a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west .  jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits .  scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride .  scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can't tell anyone .  it's a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns . 
1	john cusack stars as hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies . believe it or not demi moore is his co star .  .  . if you love the eighties , grew up around that time , or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh . wait until you see the cartoons .  . what a riot .  .  .  . 
1	rudy rae moore is getting out of prison and getting revenge !  often referred to as the godfather of rap ,  he should also be the godfather of great movies .  the non-stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you begging for more .  luckily ,  rudy comes back as dolemite in human tornado ,  so sit back relax ,  and have the rewind button ready because you won't believe your eyes !  ! 
1	the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie .  the only sci-fi part is the woolly mammoths living in the present day .   elephants are attacking villages in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people .  an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this ,  an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by woolly mammoths ,  which are suppose to be extinct .  nobody believes him at first ,  but they do when the mammoths appear at the end .  an earthquake finishes them off .   the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music ,  including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely .  the mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on .   the cast includes rod cameron ,  cesar romero  ( the lost continent )  and marie windsor  ( cat-women of the moon )  .   the jungle is worth seeing ,  just for the scenery and music .  very enjoyable .   rating :  3 stars out of 5 . 
0	american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made .  i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it .   ( i graduated from high school in 1962 .  )    however ,  more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made .   it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel .  the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate .   ( i served 18 months in vietnam with the 101st airborne division .  )    the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it .   if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies ,  more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong . 
0	 .  .  .  . so why on earth would i see 'sex lives of the potato men' ?  answer :  johnny vegas and mackenzie crook .  vegas i have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed .  i think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness .  crook i know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with 'alan partridge' ,  'the office' .  as gareth he was simply hilarious ,  and i was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen .   ok .  so me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny ,  only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter ferris and dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of vegas and crook .  they are destined for better things  ( have done better already infact )  and i even believe vegas would make a decent straight actor .  the trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching ,  although the **spoiler** tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened ,  it just wasnt believable .  and throughout the film vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times .   the film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old ,  well ,  grotesque ,  when sex was mentioned .  not ,  i add ,  when it was shown on screen .  tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny ,  and just made me feel a little bit ill .  also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of jeremy picking his nose ,  before showing a close up of the bogey on his finger .  just him picking his nose would have raised a smile ,  he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible ,  but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank .   one scene i did think was hilarious involving sex was vegas in the threesome .  his blokish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes arent always endless ecstasy .  not that i'd know .  .  .  .  .   that's about all i can say really .  i will end with this ,  and this is actually my main critique of the film .  this is supposed to revive the british film industry .  it is no 'trainspotting' that is for sure .  .  .  . it isn't even a 'love actually'  ( you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one )  ,  and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project .  'mike basset england manager' was a wonderful little known british comedy and was made for far less than 3 million .  i only hope that the bfc will learn from 'sex lives of the potato men' and not get so gratuitous in future .  although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office takings .   : - ) 
1	what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions ?   some people here have called high roller  " disgusting .  "  some have called it  " extraordinary "   ( as would i ,  actually )  .   why ?  i think it's because films like this don't make heroes out of jerks ,  or glamour out of degeneration ,  and some people just can't deal with that emotionally .  they need a hero .  and i'd also add that if they're gamblers or poker players ,  they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn't justified .   high roller in not a poker movie .  it's a people movie .  it's not perfect ,  but it looks good ,  is well-written ,  and wonderfully acted .  and best of all ,  it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection .   and maybe that's what makes some people so damn mad . 
1	 " crossfire "  feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece -- it's well acted and beautifully filmed ,  but thinly written and way too short .  as is ,  it's just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir  ( at its zenith in 1947 )  and social commentary  ( also trendy at the time )  thrown in for good measure .  it's remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism ,  and as being much better than the similarly-themed  " gentleman's agreement "   ( no mean feat )  .  but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers ,  as trained killers ,  were having as they made the transition to civilian life .   ( for a more genteel take on this topic ,  try  " the best years of our lives .  "  )  a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film .  we do not see his attacker .  the movie is about the investigation of this murder ,  which is actually pretty straightforward ,  but it takes some unnecessary detours ,  like when the main suspect ,  a depressed soldier ,  winds up in the apartment of gloria grahame ,  a dance-hall hooker with a really weird pimp played by paul kelly .  there's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl ,  and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show .  but otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery .  still ,  what a great noir it could have been .  director edward dmytryk drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel -- homosexuality ,  not anti-semitism -- like when sadistic creep monty seethes at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar .  and the cast is excellent .  robert ryan makes for a very credible cretin ,  and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes ,  not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in  " m .  "  he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund gwenn that year  ( you can't beat santa claus )  .  robert mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer .  was mitchum a great actor or a great star ?  someone else can figure that out ,  but his sleepy eyes and bemused half-smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't .   ( and he does .  )  and robert young ,  as the detective assigned to the murder ,  is surprisingly gritty ,  discarding his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civil-rights sermon midway through the picture .  there's no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role ,  but neither of them were at rko in 1947 so you'll just have to deal with dr .  welby .  still ,  young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of  " father knows best ,  "  which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts .  the man deserved better than smarm and sanka . 
1	labeling this film a  " lesbian love story "  is about as accurate as calling pride & prejudice a  " straight love story .  "  there's just so much more to it than that .   yes ,  the main character is a lesbian ,  but her story is classic bildungsroman ,  a journey from childhood to adulthood ,  from sexual innocence into maturity ,  from personal blindness to self- discovery .  there is a stylistic element of camp to the film's direction ,  but it is not a hindrance ;  rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life .   those who know anna chancellor from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here .  rachael stirling is stellar as the main character nan ,  and keeley hawes is all wide-eyed goodness as her lover kitty butler .  chancellor might have the stand out role ,  that is aside from sally hawkins who plays zena butler .  this film is not for the faint of heart ,  but it's not a piece of pro-gay advertising either .  it's a real story ,  with real comedy and drama ,  an engaging story with compelling characters ,  and well worth watching . 
0	a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece .  steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law .  in my opinion the performance of keenen ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film .  bob gunton is okay as the main heavy .  the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer .  my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia .  one of the film reasons to see the glimmer man ( 1996 )  is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus nikki cox .  its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them . 
0	wealthy businessman's daughter ,  who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath ,  discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by daddy  ( whom she affectionately refers to as  " darling "  )  ;  worse than that ,  she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live ,  leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival .  pure bunk .  paul osborn's screenplay  ( via jerome weidman's thin story )  trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot ,  which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk .  why go backwards when we can figure out what's happening for ourselves ?  this is a  " woman's weeper "  with no faith in its target audience ,  so simplistic is the set-up .  dorothy mcguire ,  swathed in furs for most of the picture ,  isn't a canny ,  clever heroine at all ;  when she's upset ,  she turns inward and stony .  upon realizing her marriage is basically a sham ,  she shrinks away from her husband like the consummate virgin  ( well ,  that's a possibility ,  she and van johnson sleep in separate beds after all !  )  .  ruth roman has the film's best moments as a society shark with her trap set for van ,  but what exactly do these women see in him ?  johnson can be charming when it's required ,  but put him in a melodramatic setting and he goes stony ,  too .  mgm production values only so-so ,  however director gottfried reinhardt tries adding some visual flavor to the flashback segues and he attempts a lively pacing for the movie's initial half-hour .  ** from ****
0	too bad ,  i really like kristen cloke and gary busey .  but the director failed to put this together .  there's a lot of action ,  a lot of promise ,  but it all comes off hokey .  the director didn't do his job .  promising action comes off lame .  so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film .  this version of  " the rage "   ( directv credits it as 1996 )  simply isn't worth the time to watch it .  another director would have done a better job . 
1	with the exception of the main character ,  the acting didn't convince me ,  but the story was quite good :  it's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary .  as you can imagine ,  such a relationship is quite problematic .  the movie is very american and ,  as such ,  has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance .  but some story lines are hilarious :  one of the main characters asks his gay colleague :   " do you believe in god ?  "  and he answers :   " you mean :  other than madonna ?  "  all in all ,  the film is not one of my all-time favorites ,  but the script is really good and i really liked it :  it's entertaining and stands up against  ( religious )  prejudice and intolerance .  i think this is an important message in our times .  since i rated films that i liked less with 9 ,  this is clearly a 10 for me .  some people may find this exaggerated ,  but i think this film deserves it . 
1	there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon ,  so i thought  " okay ,  let's watch this .  "  i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever ,  i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again .  but then story started to unfold ,  and the characters played beautifully by the two boys .  the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes ,  but overall it was a real good movie .  very well worth watching . 
0	this is absolutely nothing like the wwf and the 'attitude era' of the wwf .  i have always been a dedicated wwf fan and i never took a glimpse of its competition .  now ,  i rue the day that i wanted the wwf to take charge .  at the least the wcw would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the actual intentions of the show and this holds true to ecw as well .  the wwf has always been about hulk hogan ,  andre the giant ,  and other old wrestlers like so and the 'attitude era' only happened to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition .  the wwe is the same trash as it was before the attitude era only dumbed down and demoralized .  the wrestlers are terrible ,  the brand split is mind scrambling ,  and the story lines and stipulations are non-existent .  the wwe is so bad that it ceases to even be a former shell of itself by pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event suddenly and by retaining barriers of creativity .  sure ,  the show shakes the brains of sweet ,  innocent ,  and easily brain-washed children and meager ,  lousy ,  pariah ,  stupid people of the internet wrestling community that actually consider the company anything good .  anybody that even shudders and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell . 
0	i had been amazed by director antal's kontroll back in 2003 .  his first american project ,  vacancy ,  was less impressive but a decent start .  armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable ,  the film never rises above the level of a b movie .    it's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver .  antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick .  then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either .    what you are left with is one implausible situation after another ,  a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money .  if you look past the sharp cinematography ,  cast and the tight music score ,  you're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring van damme or seagal .    this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time . 
1	i've seen this movie at least 8 times ,  and i still laugh every time .  the movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man ,  against all odds ,  can cheat the entire over-self-confident system .   this movie is for all people ,  who like a funny movie .   the action and comedy is well mixed into a brilliant film ,  that i hope to see on dvd soon .   
1	i've been intending to write a review of this film for some time ,  but only now have i actually managed to get my thoughts down for the perusal of others .   i never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the `big screen' which is a shame ,  as it is often visually stunning ,  but i have revisited it on video numerous times over the years ,  enjoying it immensely every time .  it definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies ,  and for more than just starring kiefer sutherland and kevin bacon ,  two of my `actors to watch . '  perhaps i appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my slightly off-kilter taste in entertainment .  i like my movies a bit left of center - unpredictable and fresh .  and whether or not you `believe' the story line of the film ,  you have to admit ,  it is different !   everyone has different tastes and opinions ,  but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film .  they got caught up in technicalities ,  `why would there be green lighting in a subway ? ' or `why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt ? ' and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece .   yes ,  there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense ,  but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad ,  this can be a very engaging film .   first ,  a note about the artistic quality of the movie .  some have complained about the murky lighting ,  and the illogical nature of the sets - but for me ,  the use of innovating lighting techniques ,  the plastic and sheet draped sets ,  the unusual settings in old buildings and dank ,  dripping tunnels ,  the use of statuary ,  rain and billowing curtains - all add a poetic flavor to this film ,  a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life ,  death and forgiveness .   i will focus on just two examples ;  in an alley scene ,  a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus ,  then to fade away once lighting returns to normal .  it is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the `reality' of the moment ,  and works beautifully .  we are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments - contrast the warm wood ,  bright colors ,  golden lighting and cluttered comfort of labraccio's rooms with the stark ,  white void of nelson's .  both are reflective of the characters themselves .  nelson's lack of `objects' reflect our lack of knowledge about his past .  and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance .  his past ,  we come to learn ,  is one of chaos and conflict .  he has determined to leave that behind in favor of an uncluttered emptiness .  unfortunately ,  the emptiness is also reflective of his relationships with others ,  a realization he comes to along his personal journey of self-discovery in this film .   flatliners is not your typical horror film .  nor is a typical drama or suspense movie . it is rather more of an amalgamation of all ,  having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex ,  suspenseful plot .   this is an ensemble piece ,  and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters .  your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well-established `stereotype' :  the female ice queen ,  the slightly neurotic 'physician' ,  the playboy and the socially conscious `nice guy' etc .  however ,  as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out ,  they take on multiple dimensions and depth .   most interesting of all is sutherland's character of nelson .  nelson is not a character that is easy to like - indeed he is a bit of a b**tard ,  a master manipulator who definitely places self-interest above all else .  yet ,  sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal .  as events unfold ,  you come to realize that much of nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen ,  a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened by a terrible secret .   by revealing bits and pieces of nelson's complex personality throughout the film ,  the writers ,  directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him .  the character who started out as a `jerk' becomes important and valued in his own right - as you learn to `forgive' his previous behavior in light of new information .  your journey of discovery with nelson reflects the characters own journeys towards self-understanding ,  as they too come to realize that everyone has value ,  and `everything we do matters . '  which leads to my final comment .  although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of defying death .  .  few seem to have touched upon what i see as the main premise of the movie - the importance of forgiveness ,  and the need to be cognizant of all you do ,  because it does `matter .

0	this is the worst hindi film i have ever seen .  it conforms to all the stereotypes of bad hindi films .  the plot is ridiculous ,  the acting over the top ,  and shah rukh manages to fit in a couple of song sequences even though he is playing the character of a dumb man . 
1	pretty decent for his early work and no kokaku kidotai without it ,  and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs .  for shirow definitely a rung in the ladder .  i am biased as a shirow fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him .  violent fun with a porno soundtrack !  you cannot help but notice that .  i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell .  . but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in appleseed .  eswat killing terrorists ,  the struggle for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase them out ,  and deunan staying thin despite her intake of junk food .  definitely like the characters even the traitor .  . and i do not know why . 
1	what can i say about this band ,  i was hooked in 68 ,  i was a ten year old kid ,  i grew up on the blues though my dad ,  then these guys from the midlands came along ,  a fusion of country rock ,  heavy rock and blues ,  i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years ,  i was lucky enough to be there in 79 ( knebworth )  that was the best concert i've seen to date ,  i hope a full version of that hot august night will be realest soon .  this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again ,  the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty .   long live the zepp . 
0	this movie was one of the most boring horror movies i have seen in a long time  ( and i have seen a lot )  .  personally i liked the piercing take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty unwatchable .  i could not stand dee snider as an actor nor as a singer .  i seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote ,  which they weren't .  i can get movies for free and i still didn't think it was worth the time to get . 
1	i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster .  this movie has it all - comedy ,  drama ,  crime ,  suspense and  " realism "  .   this movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor !  i will definitely watch it again !  there were some funny parts as well as action-packed drama .  i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what's going to happen next .   the writer/director ,  travis milloy ,  should make more movies !  !  !  in my overall opinion ,  this movie was great !  i'm looking forward to his next one !  travis milloy has real talent as a writer and director . 
0	two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head .  that's the first scene ,  and it made me wince ,  fearing what was in store .  but by the end of the first half hour i was all swept up in the flood of images .  not because i cared in the least about any of the characters but because i was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink .   frank  ( remar )  and red  ( woolvett )  are the ex-inmates .  after murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of dean stockwell and his two sons ,  the attorney keith and the estranged homosexual behr .  the escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone ,  but they gradually reveal their identities .   well ,  it looks like familiar territory so far .   " desperate hours ,  "  or  " funny games "  maybe .  but -- hang on -- the gay son is in cahoots with the two .  it seems that stockwell ,  upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named billy ,  kicked billy around and threw him out .  billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death .  and ,  indeed ,  dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias ,  the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding .   the grief-stricken behr just searched and searched ,  looking for someone else who had known billy ,  someone with whom he could share his despair .  it turned out to be one of the escapees ,  and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom .   it gets all twisted after that .  people talk .  they talk and talk .  they talk continually .  and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes .  no -- the dialog goes something like ,   " you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son .  "  that's behr ,  the young gay guy ,  talking to stockwell .  it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker .   the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees .  and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone ,  which sounds like lance henrickson's ,  and his wide guppy-like lips .  he's easy on the eyes and ears .   dean stockwell has given decent performances ,  including his inestimable bizarro turn in  " blue velvet ,  "  in which he was my supporting player ,  but here laziness ,  advancing years ,  or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype .  it's as if he were reading stage directions --  " look surprised "  and  " shout angrily "  -- and following them literally .  there's not a surprise in a cartload .   if the gay son ,  jason behr ,  ever blinked ,  it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it .  he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument .  woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot paneled woodwork .  the attorney son is robert glen keith .  i hope he didn't quit his day job .   the direction is pedestrian ,  the staging functional without being in the least innovative .  sometimes it's confusing .  i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun .  i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the cabin's door ,  hit remar ,  and knock him in a back flip off the porch ,  and then remar could simply stand up ,  dust himself off ,  and come up with a cranky riposte like ,   " okay .  two can play that game .  "  but why go on ?  see it if you must . 
1	i don't really know when it was that tv stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of the mens' iqs - but it was clearly a problem by the time that  " broadcast news "  came out ,  and the movie does a really good job looking at it .  portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air-head reporter tom grunick  ( william hurt )  ,  intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman  ( albert brooks )  and producer jane craig  ( holly hunter )  ,  the movie pulls no punches .  probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like :   " i don't really understand any of what i'm reporting .  "  and in the era of fox news and such things ,  a movie like this becomes even more important .   all in all ,  definitely a movie that i recommend .  also starring robert prosky ,  lois chiles ,  joan cusack ,  and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman . 
0	arnold fans will holler in joy ,  fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment ,  and catholics will just holler .   illogically written by andrew w .  marlowe and ham-handedly directed by peter hyams ,  *end of days* gets the terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown  ( arnold schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation )  ,  whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine about .   it is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn .  even as the technological stank of y2k muttons the new york streets ,  ex-cop turned alcoholic security guard ,  jericho cane  ( schwarzenegger ,  with the perfunctory  " dead-wife-and-kid "  back-story for loose cannon effect )  ,  must brave theological waters to save 20-year-old virgin christine  ( robin tunney )  from being conscripted as  wait for it  the bride of satan .  dun dah daaaarrrh !  stupidity ensues .   for every anti-hero ,  there is his anti-christ .  gabriel byrne is the devil here  and he's out to party like it's 1999 ,  on a mission to impregnate christine with the anti-christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight ,  december 31 ,  1999  ironically ,  in the hour that all porn will be lost  thereby bringing about the end of days .  being able to read minds ,  conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic ,  it doesn't occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time ;  instead ,  he appears on december 28th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs  ( see above comment re :  stupidity .  )  here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered ,  let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology .  a priest  ( rod steiger )  tells jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front of it .  so wait - *prince* is the anti-christ ?   satan soze pursues jericho and christine  ( j and c  get it ?  )  around town ,  at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture .  in one scene ,  satan recreates jericho's wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine .  but if he can see so deeply into jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia ,  why can't he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago ?    satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue ,  yet he can't make that assassin unjam a semi-automatic weapon .  and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range ,  satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing ,  so jericho won't worry unduly about satan's health - not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact ,  instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her ,  satan expends so much unnecessary energy on side-projects  ( crucifying the tongue-less guy ,  blowing up jericho's partner  ( kevin pollak )  and then saving him ,  and then blowing him up again ,  ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought )  that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin/lover shouldn't be put on the case  say ,  antonio banderas .   what i find most precious about *end of days* is arnold's valiant attempts at the method :   " sad "  means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent ;   " depressed "  means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent ;   " deathly scared "  means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent .  there's definitely a pattern here ,  if we could only decipher it .   in the end ,  the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these ,  but from the atheist jericho .  while the timid men of an impotent god exhort  " faith "  and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them ,  the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent .  which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear :  that even if the devil were to exist ,  those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall ,  let alone act towards it .  further ,  they might not truly want him defeated ,  for only through his contrary polarity does their god's existence become tenable .   for it is written in the book of revelations :   " and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan ,  and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia ,  by which time ,  christians will have forgotten christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead .  and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously-lesbian band members "  i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified ,  and the alcoholic built like a mr .  universe ;  i can believe that a giant ,  supernatural monster can't kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent ;  i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay - but what i cannot believe is the 20-year-old virgin in new york city in 1999 .   especially around prince .  .  . 
0	this is the worst movie that i have ever seen .  at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the bermuda triangle ,  but instead it was terrible .  all it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense  ( if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age ,  and her son aged rapidly )  ,  and have a horrible sappy ending .  next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them .  please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list . 
0	i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three .   i did some swell pictures for him ,  one of which i was told became the poster for the movie .  i didn't see the film until years later .  i thought it was bad .  a pity ,  because the elements that went into it were compelling .  robie porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as rampling herself .  salter asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice .  i said sure ,  but i had to return to ny ,  promising i'd be back .  alas ,  i never did get back .  one of life's unsung melodies .   i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere .   rowland scherman
0	i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing .  the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say ,  don't judge a dvd by it's cover .    i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic .  it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin .  the music was pretty ordinary .  the story really didn't go anywhere .  it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue .   i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though .  watch this film .  it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival .   however ,  good on them for getting in there and having a go .  hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better . 
0	this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie--gee maybe that's why it is a straight-to-video wanna-be movie !   i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it  ( one of the worst decisions i have ever made )  .  what a waste .  i usually like b movies ,  some of them are actually quite good--but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny .   the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film !  these so-called movie makers have absolutely no talent !   stupid plot ,  horrible acting  ( especially the drag queens--what sicko would actually find that sexy ?  !  )  ,  lame writing  ( if there even was a script--seems like the kinda bull**** someone just made up on the spot )   what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well-done at all .   how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards ?  i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally ,  and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results .   anyway ,  avoid this stink bomb at all costs !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
0	i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind !  i am a fan of peanuts ,  but i can't understand why charles schultz let this disaster be made !  spoilers ahead .   i can't believe snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and swig a few cold ones without standing watch !  the story was complete nonsense ,  even for comic strip characters .  it takes them toooo long to get to france ,  plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer  ( i still can't believe it was schultz )  didn't know what to do once they got there .   peanuts is best made in 30 minute episodes ,  not 80 minute movies .   go home charlie brown ,  you are at your best there .   
1	the first ,  and far better ,  of kevin kline's two gay roles .   ( the second is the dreary  " de-lovely "  in which he played cole porter .  )  inspired by tom hanks' emotional acceptance speech for  " philadelphia "  in which he outed his high school drama teacher ,  the nominated film in this version was obviously more  " forrest gump "  than  " philadelphia "  .  here the hanks character is played by matt dillon .   the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and ,  as has been often pointed out ,  are especially effective as done by kevin himself ,  debbie reynolds ,  tom selleck  ( a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors ,  which he denied !  )  ,  bob newhart and joan cusack as the eventually jilted bride-to-be .   tom hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life .  but this is a farce and not real life .  that being said ,  it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final  " wedding scene "  which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get hitched i found rather pointless ,  annoying and a cop out .   the highlight of the film for me is ,  of course ,  kevin's scene with the how-to-be-a-real-man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to kevin's actions .   on the whole ,  a hoot ! 
1	first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and dario argento fan .  although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies ,  i really enjoyed almost every one i did see .  i really like giallos and i thought argento was the master of this genre ,  after seeing films like  " tenebre "  and  " phenomena "  .  but after i saw  " new york ripper "  by fulci ,  i found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo argento ,  on a certain level .   i love fulci's style ,  and yes i love gore ,  but this film i think ,  although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films ,  is not his best one .  what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times ,  especially at the end .  and the fact that we go from one suspect ,  to another ,  and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment ,  i think it goes too far .  i know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end ,  and the killer should be very hard to find ,  but this film plays a little too much with our minds .  however i did like the scene when the witch is killed ,  i think it is very well done and gave me the chills .  the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great .   although this is not a bad film ,  i think lucio fulci has made better films than this ,  and i think his best one is  " the beyond "  ,  a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience .   i give  " don't torture a duckling "  a 7 out of 10 .   
0	every movie i have ppv'd because leonard maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks !  every single one !  when will i ever learn ?   evie is a raving old bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get her way !  laura is an insufferable medusa filled with the holy spirit  ( and her hubby's protégé )  !  caught between these harpies is medusa's dumb-as-a-rock boy who has been pressed into weed-pulling servitude by the old bag !   as i said ,  when will i ever learn ?   i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise when the old bag stuck her head in a sink ,  but ,  unfortunately ,  she did not die .  i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise again when medusa got mowed down ,  but ,  unfortunately ,  she did not die .  it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this !   without harry potter to kick him around ,  rupert grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets .  julie walters's scenery-chewing  ( especially the scene when she  " plays "  god )  is even more shameless than her character .   at least this harold bangs some bimbo instead of maude .  for that ,  i am truly grateful .  and if you're reading this mr .  maltin ,  you owe me $3 . 99 ! 
0	you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother ,  this is the best he can do .  and sad to say ,  his best just doesn't cut it .   " ice cream man "  is a very bizarre horror film ,  that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood .  in the wrong mood ,  it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones ,  so please ,  watch with caution .   clint howard stars  ( does anything really star clint howard though ?  )  as the  " evil "   " psychotic "   " bizarre "   ( yes all in quotes ,  he's not quite any of these ,  but he's getting close )  ice cream man ,  who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them .  ick .   anyway ,  the plot's really just an excuse to show of the .  .  . well ,  the .  .  . um ,  well it's a plot .  oh wait ,  i know !  it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos !  there's jan michael vincent and lee majors ii  ( the sequel ?  )  as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream .  and even doug lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk .   even better than that ,  are some of the bizarre goofs in the film .  i really like the fact that for some reason ,  instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy  " fat "  kid of the group ,  they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes .  and the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man .  who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man ?  then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene ,  in which jan michael vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested ,  to bored beyond the state of consciousness .  these are the cops who also scour the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck  ( where ,  of course ,  the various bodies and such are kept )  .  oh well ,  better luck next time troops .   howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him .  it's all just plain dumb .  and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the pumaman or gymkata .  you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor .  i love that one .   
0	for reasons i cannot begin to fathom ,  dr .  lorenzo cameron  ( george zucco )  begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman ,  petro  ( glenn strange )  .  the result  petro is transformed into a hideous  ( as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be )  killer beast .  dr .  cameron uses petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas  ( and why wouldn't they ,  dr .  cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake )  .   overall ,  the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller .  there's really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster .  george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone .  his dr .  cameron is a regular loony .  he has no qualms about killing ;  he has entire conversations with people who aren't there ;  and ,  as with most mad scientists ,  he messes in  " god's domain "   ( actually ,  i'm not sure anyone accuses him of this ,  but it fits )  .  but beyond zucco ,  there's nothing here to recommend .  everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad .  there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster . 
1	 " the cure "  is a very touching and poignant drama .  the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends .  one of the boys has aids .  the boys become good friends despite erik's apprehensiveness at first .  the film shows the boys journey to discover  " the cure "  ,  which is in ohio according to  " the national examiner "  ,  and how it affects their relationship .  the acting is wonderful  ( i have never seen annabella sciorra do better )  ,  and the movie is just plain touching .  i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene .  this is a good tearjerker .  keep the kleenex nearby .  8/10
0	while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life .  she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects ,  but not really enough to add to the validity of the film .   i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things .  if a guy said a filthy comment ,  grabbed her ,  or made some disgusting gesture to her ,  i would say go for it ,  bring him down ,  he's a pig .  what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it .   i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are .  guys will look at beautiful women ,  especially when they dress provocatively ,  just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all .   some women may hate me for this ,  but i hope not .  i have much respect for women .  i was raised by one .  i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal .  my grandmother was the center of my family for years ,  but i don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself ,  some women were offended by her project . 
1	this documentary is the most hypnotizing film i have seen in a long while .  i must have had it on for an entire day .  the selected material included in the piece flow amazingly well and develop three characters that are impossible to ever forget .  the different layers of these people peel back to make an oddly moving film about perseverance ,  loyalty and determination .  these characters ended up suprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable . 
0	what could be expected from any adam sandler-produced comedy ,  grandma's boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening .  allen covert stars as alex in the film ,  a 35 year old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment .  some usual plot turns occur :  he has trouble adjusting to his new living situation ,  which in turn makes him have trouble at work ,  which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the office's new consultants .  throw a weird boss ,  almost alien company star ,  really nerdy best friend ,  a few scenes at burnt-out pot dealer's place ,  a really big party scene ,  and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have grandma's boy in its entirety .  allen covert does make a marginally good lead ,  linda cardellini is cute enough for her role as the just-one-of-the-nerds office consultant samantha ,  and a few scenes do manage to squirt out a chuckle or two but none of that makes grandma's boy worth much of anyone's time .  most of the supposed funny  " jokes "  or  " gags "  or whatever you want to call them are nothing but  " humor "  that would make anyone at national lampoons embarrassed to watch ,  joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j . p .  ,  and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial .  well ,  at least grandma's boy did something for someone :  adam sandler was able to get a few paychecks to his out-of-work friends david spade ,  kevin nealon ,  and rob schneider . 
1	this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives .  my heart is shrinking every time i saw the scene of hanging .  i have no words any .  .  .  you must see this brilliant picture . 
0	critics love this movie .  i personally found it senseless and tasteless .  this is the millionth time i've fallen into the  " critics love it "  trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie .  there are many scenes that are completely unnecessary .  a warning to animal lovers :  don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested .   if you want to see a good asian film ,  see afrika .  if you want to see a film about escaped convicts ,  see the gene wilder/richard pryor classic stir crazy .  avoid 9 souls like the plague . 
1	i've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut .  both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them .   next to  " the soft skin "  ,  coincidentally staring deneuve's sister  ( the late francoise dorleac )  ,  this would have to be my favourite truffaut film .   as well as directing ,  truffaut also wrote the screenplay .  something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety .   there's a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot .  he rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee .  in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street ,  deneuve changes into her dress ,  puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes ,  then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep .  it's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's truffaut for you .   watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure .  she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch .  incidentally ,  for those fans ,  there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure .   i disagree with previous posters .  i see nothing 'hitchcockian' about the film at all .  as for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's .  it certainly gives films of this period a unique look .   highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans .  .  .  .  .  . 
0	in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney ,  who was formerly a prosecutor .  he is a bit tormented ,  but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster .  funny thing is ,  he doesn't quite pull it off .  i guess you can't quite get to normal from there .  kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy .  the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares .  and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie ,  although the rest of the time miss young did just fine .  this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability .  and failing .  don't bother . 
1	considering this film was released 8 years before i was born ,  i don't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time .  back in january of 98 though ,  i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin , texas .  the particular theme of films this night was  " neglected 70's crime films "  and boy was her right .   " the gravy train ( or the dion brothers ,  as it appeared this print )  "  was an absolute gem .  wonderful performances ,  quirky characters ,  smart plot ,  hilarious comedy ,  and just an all around great time .  rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh .  margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well .  i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it .  in the meantime ,  go to an indie video store and hope they have it . 
1	this second pairing of wile e .  coyote and the road runner is a great as the first .  predictable maybe ,  but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it .  the wile e . /road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart .  so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this ,  but they would be in chronological order  ( 2 through 12 ,  the first episode was on volume 1 )  ,  made me get misty eyed .  i love this stuff .  this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 .  it also features an optional commentary by micheal barrier .   my grade :  a+
1	race against fear has to be one of the most moving tv movies i've seen for a long time .  all of the performances from the main actors were superb ,  especially that of ariana richards  ( mickey carlyle )  ,  william bullimer  ( coach kurt ansom )  ,  and susan blakely  ( margaret carlyle )  .  ariana in particular put on an extremely emotional performance ,  with facial expressions to match .  she portrayed the emotions that mickey was feeling perfectly ,  and you could easily believe that she really had been raped ,  so realistic was her performance .   raf is an incredibly realistic movie ,  due to the moving performances from the cast .  bullimer came across as a rapist incredibly well ,  and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed .  blakely also put on an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl  ( mickey carlyle )  ,  and you felt increasingly sorry for the carlyle family because no-one believed them about the rape .   all in all ,  raf is a great movie .  it is both moving and full of suspense ,  as you are continually unsure if ansom would be prosecuted for the rape ,  due to the lack of witnesses ,  evidence ,  and belief in the claim .  i thoroughly recommend seeing this movie . 
1	for those curious ,  this episode is based in theme upon pirandello's play ,   " six characters in search of an author "  and jean-paul sartre's play ,   " no exit "   ( as indicated most obviously by its title )  ,  but ,  of course ,  with a sterling twist .    five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire .  a bell intermittently rings  ( perhaps also a hemmingway allusion ?  )  ,  increasing the agony of their incarceration .  the newcomer to the group ,  a major ,  is determined to escape ,  while the others are resigned to their fate .    unlike pirandello ,  these characters don't even have a story .  they have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness ,  and no one to author their nonexistent story ,  so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in pirandello's piece .  unlike both pirandello and sartre ,  there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them ,  though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story .    though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title ,  themes of sartre and pirandello  ( and many other authors of the twentieth century )  come through with absolute clarity .  this is very obviously a piece which addresses post-modernist perspective in the context of the cold war era .  there is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance .    this is easily one of the best episodes i've seen ,  and still exceptionally relevant to current experience  ( as are sartre and pirandello )  .  exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic . 
1	i decided i need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film .  unlike other war films that focus on the event ,  apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip .  the sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable ,  yet you can't lay your eyes off of it .  based off of joseph conrad's heart of darkness ,  apocalypse now slowly descends its protagonist ,  willard  ( martin sheen )  into madness ,  most likely the same way kurtz plunged into insanity .  the production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for brando's unprepared performance  ( he read his lines from cue cards )  .  there is a documentary titled apocalypse now :  a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this .   the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film .  as the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees ,  the song  " the end "  by the doors can be heard .  the next shot is of willard in his bed with the fan on ,  so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan .  we are informed that he does special missions for the military ,  mostly assassinations .  when his next mission is given to him ,  he is baffled .   " charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the indy 500 .  "  the man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people .  kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped .  willard does not go alone however .  he is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles .  along the way ,  they meet lieutenant colonel bill kilgore  " hoorah "  about the war .  willard ponders that if kilgore is that crazy ,  what could kurtz be like .  there are many scenes that portray willards plunge into insanity :  the tiger attack ,  the slaughter of innocent vietnamese ,  the nonstop rain ,  the piled dead bodies scattered about ,  and the deaths of his crew members .  when he reaches the kurtz compound ,  he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist  ( dennis hopper )  .  instead of assassinating kurtz right away ,  willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do .  kurtz ,  on the other hand wants to die .  he is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier .  willard kills him with a machete while in unison ,  a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people .  once they realize their leader has been slain ,  instead of killing willard ,  they hail him as their new king .  willard rejects the offer and leaves them .   the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking .  the colors are grain free ,  something that is rare in older movies .  i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery .   the acting ensemble is terrific ,  with everyone playing their parts well .  many criticize brando for some reason ,  but i think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war .   the soundtrack and the score are haunting ,  and provide the mood for the film .  i am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll ?  there have been many parodies of this film ,  but my favorite quote comes from marge simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot :   " your character provides comic relief for the show ,  like um ,  marlon brando in apocalypse now .  "  those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious . 
0	i can imagine why he'd want to die ,  after starring in this rubbish .  the man is incredible ,  but even sidney poitier couldn't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old west .  he and joanna going are both fantastic in this film :  too bad the screenplay ,  co-stars ,  directing ,  and score couldn't match those two . 
0	'tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go .   i can hardly find something good to say about this film .  the premises are completely wrong .  a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth ,  but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this . a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing .  when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event .  and so on ,  and so on  .  .  .   neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen .  is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast ?  the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done ,  and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say .  the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects ,  but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s ,  four decades before this film was made .   a total waste of time . 
0	i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels .  i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast ,   " groovy "  haircuts aside ,  and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars ?  having not seen the original ,  i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure ,  since it was obviously on a ship in distress .  was i wrong !  i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great  ( or promising )  actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash .  there is no story ,  the performances all looked forced ,  the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event ,  and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy .   it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field ,  michael caine ,  et al .  they must have needed the money badly .  can we blame the director ? 
0	i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production .  the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece ,  but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen .   the story follows four  ( five )  teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials .  they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called  " the covenant "  .  their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive .  in theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movieor at least an interesting teeny flick .   but there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential .  that acting wasn't good ,  the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues .  for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job .  the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing .   the movie has it's moments ,  but overall was a little disappointing .   a witchy 4/10
0	so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo  ( drc )  and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule .  i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history ,  mainly lumumba and mobutu .  i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule ,  the political motives behind each one ,  the reasons behind belgium's decision to give the drc its independence ,  and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved .  sadly ,  all of my questions went largely unanswered .  my belief is that this movie was made by people who ,  through a passing familiarity with the story of the drc's fight for freedom ,  saw a story filled with drama and emotion ,  and decided to exploit it .  they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline ,  briefly filled them out with dialogue ,  went to the set and shot it .  i could be wrong ,  but if so it's all the sadder ,  because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in ,  and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history .  whatever the reason ,  the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence-long statements and facts printed on the screen .  the film goes through each major occurrence ,  and tells the viewer point-blank the main idea of what's going on ,  completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things .  for instance ,  there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu .  in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints :  one that sympathizes with lumumba ,  one that vilifies lumumba ,  and one that stands in the middle ,  sympathizing and yet obeying orders .  correspondingly ,  there are three soldiers that speak in the scene ,  uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view .  then ,  to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up ,  the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting ,  more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up .  this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie .  most of the time ,  each character simply states their basic motives ,  the other characters respond with theirs ,  and that's that .  there's little telling through actions ;  even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness .  it's hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that .  also ,  in the trend of this directness ,  things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact-- we never learn what these factions are ,  what they're fighting for ,  their power ,  basically anything except that they exist .  the characters likewise are one-dimensional and flat ;  unfortunately i don't know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity ,  but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didn't trust it to tell me so .  the drc ,  like many developing countries ,  has a complicated and important history ,  especially in the period leading up to and after independence .  but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations .  lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details ,  and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines . 
1	chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who ,  with amnesia ,  is mistaken for the dictator adenoid hynkel ,   ( i . e hitler )  a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies .  . it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost ,  he surely wouldve been sent away to be  " reeducated "   a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world .  . good fun but with a message .  . a little preachy in the end .  this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache .  on a scale of one to ten .  . 9
0	lois weber's film  " hypocrites "  was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film .  i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it .  the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the  " naked "  truth .  the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth ,  after failing to lead them to it and the few that did ,  help along the way .  the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong ,  but it shows them putting things before god ,  going to beach parties acting inappropriate ,  their materialistic ways ,  and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right .  in the end ,  failing to gain any followers ,  he must enter into the gates of heaven alone .  this film seems to me to be very bold ,  in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it ,  especially considering the time period in which this film was made .  the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible .  the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art .  showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path ,  each with different excuses ,  setbacks ,  and/or higher priorities ,  was a great way of representing the people of today .  this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience .  lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity ,  symbolism ,  visuals ,  and through auditory .  even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme . 
1	film follows four friends from the 1950s  ( when they're in high school )  up to 1981 .  they are danilo  ( craig wasson )  a yugoslavian immigrant ;  georgia  ( jodi thelan )  a  " free spirit "  ;  david  ( michael huddleston )  who has no personality and tom  ( jim metzler )  a big ,  strong ,  handsome ,  rugged guy .  all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves danilo .  the film mostly focuses on those two--it chronicles their lives ,  love and attraction to each other over the years .  it also gets into danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father .    i love this film but it's not without its bad points .  thelan's high ,  squeaky voice is annoying  ( but you get used to it )  ;  the story jumps around very quickly ;  tom and david's lives are never explained  ( tom shows up with a vietnamese wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end )  ;  some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre-release cutting  ( probably to keep the film at 2 hours )  .   but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems .  the story is compelling--you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives .  with a few exceptions ,  the script  ( by steve tesich )  is good--in fact ,  tesich was a yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences .  all the acting is great--especially thelan and wasson--also reed birney throws in a strong ,  likable performance as louie ,  danilo's college roommate .  and lois smith is very interesting in her role .  and look quick for mercedes ruehl and glenne headly !   basically ,  it's a real great story about immigrants ,  coming of age ,  love of america and covers the 50-80s perfectly .   this film was  ( unjustly )  maligned on its release .  the studio didn't know how to advertise it  ( it is a hard film to market )  and the critics stomped on it  ( pauline kaels' review in  " the new yorker "  was particularly harsh )  .  it barely played in theaters  ( i was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run )  and has simply disappeared .  that's a shame .  this is a movie that is just ripe for reissue .  i'm not betting on it--but you never know !  a definite 10 all the way ! 
0	the revisionist history -- making the evil marquis de sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough .  but the atrocious acting ,  amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad .  the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous .  and ,  amazingly ,  being tortured for days ,  with hands bound overhead ,  apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty ,  hairstyle and makeup .  my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia ,  choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability .  if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do ,  or are a film student looking for bad examples ,  fast-forward through every scene not involving nudity . 
1	the 25th hour was a movie i just chanced upon . tuning in late at night ,  this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film . tony quin is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman , and by simple jealousy  ,  goes on this incredible journey--terrific movie , and a hidden treasure . 
0	oh gosh , i'm really fed up with all these generic japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids .  " ghost train "  is no exception . it is clearly influenced by  " ringu "  ,  " ju-on "  ,  " shutter "  and  " pulse "  . two years ago i was into such modern ghost stories , because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps , unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in  " ghost train "  . in fact the film is really boring . noriko goes missing in a subway tunnel-like an elementary-school classmate-nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances , with the help of a youthful train conductor and another  " disappeared "  child's mother . the film offers some mildly creepy moments , however the cgi effects are laughable and the climax is illogical . skip it . 
1	this is a forgotten classic of a film ,  and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for  " gummo "  .  gummo is good ,  river's edge is way ,  way better .  its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth .  no ,  in fact ,  he's a horrendous actor .  but ,  he was born for some roles :  ted preston ,  esquire from bill and ted ,  and his role in this film .  he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager .  then there's crispin glover .  i think his performance in this film is the best of his career .  he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character .  then there's dennis hopper ,  who is perfect as well .  this movie is simply amazing ,  and if you haven't seen it ,  run out and watch it today .  its brilliant .  one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen . 
1	i must admit ,  i didn't expect this to be as good as it was .  i also didn't expect samuel l .  jackson to play slide and sing blue either .   cinemark of beaver county pa does this frequently .  they advertise movies in the lobby ,  get you all excited about seeing it ,  and then disappoint you by not showing it .  .  .   i expected that with such a great cast of jackson and ricci and even a former n'syncer  ( timberlake )  ,  that this movie would at least have shown for a week .  but nay ,  at that time if i remember correctly mi3 was showing on 3 screens  ( that or some other type of supposed blockbuster )  .   like blues brothers ,  and crossroads ,  this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about .  passion ,  and hard times .  religion and sex .  hell hounds of the past .  redemption .  i mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work .   this was just a good all around story .  of course ,  not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders .  but it does have samuel l .  jackson .  .  .   think of what happens to jacksons character from pulp fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a  " t "  .   great and underrated ,  but aren't all the good ones like that anyway ? 
1	amazing ,  one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom .  guess i can take some pride in not liking what  " the general populace "  tends to go for .  jackie mason is hilarious in this movie ,  and so's randy quaid .  i can never get enough of his  " strong-arm "  tactics ,  just like in moving .  he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation .  love that guy . 
1	an eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious sect compound near waco ,  texas .  seventy-six people ,  including sect leader ,  david koresh ,  perished in a flaming inferno that destroyed the compound .  there is still heated debate over how the fire started .  homicide or suicide ?  can you still trust government ethics ?   
1	more and more french cinema demonstrates that's the only one able to confront hollywood's ,  and to spend high amounts on money in their movies .  if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised .  perfectly set in france ,  in the 40's ,  when the nazi invasion ,  technically irreproachable ,  and with some of the most international french actors  ( depardieu ,  adjani ,  ledoyen .  .  .  )  .  bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories :  an scientific and his disciple  ( ledoyen )  who tries to hide one of his discoveries  ( a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb )  from the nazis ;  and a poor guy in love with a well known actress  ( adjani )  ,  which ends up in prison accused of a crime he's not committed in order to protect her .    bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style ,  without unnecessary camera movements and effects .  without big turns in the plot .  as i said before ,  regarding to the production itself they've made a great job .  but the main problem with this movie is about the script .  is it a spy-movie ?  a romantic comedy ?  a spy comedy ?  a comedy of intrigue ?  it's not clear .  that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced .  when you think you're watching a comedy ,  suddenly changes to another story-line ,  a more dramatic one ,  more slow .  .  .  i think they should've focused in one of the lines of argument  ( the one about the spy plot )  and left the romantic parts in the background .   my rate :  6 . 5/10
1	 " what alice found "  is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of !  i underestimated it when i heard of it ,  and i though that it would all sex ,  no plot ,  and just really stupid ,  but in reality ,  it was really good .  they say all indie movies suck ,  but this one ,  and  " napoleon dynamite "  didn't suck .  i asked my friend ,  who'd seen it before i did ,  and she said that alice has all these three-ways ,  and you see all this nudity ,  but no ,  there is no three-way that i remember ,  and little nudity .  the movie did have a point ,  and it taught me never trust hitchhikers .  i liked that in the end ,  they got alice a little dolphin in the end ,  on her way to flordia .  i totally suggest seeing this movie . 
0	pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror ,  science fiction and suspense films .  there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films .  not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious  (  " movie horror helps us deal with real horror "  ,   " you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre "  )  and pretty trite .  also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring .  and ,  shown out of context ,  these bits aren't very scary at all .  and it's real short--i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid $5 . 00 for an 84 minute movie !   still ,  it is reasonably well-edited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves .  for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting .  but if you're a horror fan  ( like me )  you'll probably be bored silly .  good idea ,  bad execution  ( no pun intended )  .  i give it a 3 . 
1	this is a good film .  this is very funny .  yet after this film there were no good ernest films ! 
0	jim varney's first real movie is quite a delight ,  but don't come in expecting to see ernest p .  worrel any time soon .  i felt the wide array of characters varney depicted were great ,  but without being said ,  the rest of the movie should be put into a mulcher or something .  a rather odd beginning for a movie icon . 
0	if there's one thing i want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here ,  it's that i am the queen of finding strange movies in thrift and dollar stores .  that said ,  you can't possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one .    i can even remember that saturday morning when *every* station simulcast it ,  so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else  ( then again ,  i guess that was the idea )  .  as a kid ,  i didn't know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together  ( there are some crossovers that just do *not* work )  .  but i guess the special had it's intended effect .  don't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppets .   now ,  if you watch this as an adult ,  on the other hand ,  you will be treated to the *strangest* anti-drug movie this side of  " reefer madness "  .  i think i'll just leave it at that before i get into trouble . 
0	this movie is bad .  really bad .  so bad it made me want to shoot myself in the forehead .  i hated this movie .  first off ,  the plot went absolutely nowhere and anything shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second teaser trailer .  secondly ,  anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie too and completely unworthy of a remake .  by far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in .  which is not saying much for the actual movie .  there were parts in the movie when the music gets very suspenseful and you're positive someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the maid or the cat ,  but when someone actually is around the corner it is impossible to be even startled because you've been expecting it all movie .  so save yourself the money ,  save yourself the time ,  save yourself the headache and just watch the trailer .  there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie ,  not in the theater ,  not on dvd ,  not on tv ,  never . 
1	the bbc and hbo teamed up to create  " dirty war "  ,  a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist  " dirty bomb "  attack in london .  the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots .  on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation .  on the government side we see pr and training exercises ,  intelligence gathering and analysis ,  interdiction ,  post-detonation response ,  and follow up .  the film also imparts a sense of how al-qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized ,  the radical islamic terrorist mentality ,  and terrorist strategies .  a sort of anatomy of a  " dirty bomb "  incident ,   " dirty war "  will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat .   ( b ) 
0	horrible horrible movie ,  i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this !  no plot ,  bad acting ,  unfunny scenes ,  and very very stupid dialogue .  all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too .  so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10 ,  well on here a 1 ,  but you get the point . 
0	reading through most of the other reviews ,  i tend to agree with most of the comments .  the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced .  i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual  ( sometimes jerky )  camera angles ,  and flitting from one scene to another .  it goes down well with these movie festivals ,  and with some of these indie type critics ,  but it spoils the movie for me .  i noticed in the reviews ,  one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters .  this would maybe prove my point ,  as the film has that 'rushed to finish' feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow .  as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster ,  i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut .  this is a story with real potential ,  spoilt by trying to be different in it's production .  worth watching ,  but not many would come back for a second view . 
1	forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead .  i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck's other great christmas story ,   " meet john doe "  aren't revered with the same level of love as .  .  . well ,  you know it's name .   stanwyck plays a food writer for a mccall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes .  she's an ace b . s .  artist until the day morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a navy hospital .  released the last year of wwii ,  the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality .  stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight .  unfortunately ,  she has to play married to gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in ct ,  just to fool her boss .   s . z .  sakall adds a great deal of hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as babs' true source of culinary talent & una o'connor is hilarious as gardiner's obnoxious irish housekeeper . 
1	i first saw the couch trip  ( 1988 ) on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it .  the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it .  dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period .  he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live .  but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest .  with a good supporting cast of charles grodin ,  david clennon ,  and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold .  ackroyd's wife donna dixxon even does a fine job here .  my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david clennon's charachter lawrence baird .  those two played well off each other .  so if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip .  i just did ,  amazon 78 cents .  what a bargain ,  too bad i got hit with a 2 . 50 shipping fee .  oh well still well worth it .  any guy will love this flick check it out . 
1	maverick director seijun suzuki finally was able to film his dream project ,   " princess raccoon "  and in a way it's lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's .  special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have .   some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film .  much as familiarity with shakespeare's  " the tempest "  would help with peter greenaway's dense  " prospero's books "  .  these two films actually have a bit in common although ,   " princess raccoon "  is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it .   while the art design ,  acting and direction are fine for most of the film ,  it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film .  most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience .   this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance .  it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them .  if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars . 
0	while this movie did have a few scary moments  ( great use of music and film angles to build suspense )  ,  it's obvious director ethan wiley and scriptwriter ellary eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter ;  which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine catholic bishop .   amongst the many inconsistencies :    * jacob the roman catholic priest ,  when we first meet him outside the church ,  is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb ,  chasuble or surplice .  academic robes are commonly worn by protestant ministers in liturgical denominations ,  not roman catholic priests .    * jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons .  he attributes it to st .  paul .  this verse is not from st .  paul's writings ,  neither is it in the bible .  i can't even find it in the gnostic scriptures .    * jacob tells his bishop he doesn't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180  ( later that same day ?  )  within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle .  sure ,  it's possible ;  but a little unrealistic .  see father damien as a priest/psychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic-turned-believer .    * miguel ,  the former priest turned farmhand ,  is the first to try an exorcism on isabelle .  he quotes scripture ,  and she quotes back .  he says  " i see you know psalm 65 "  - she corrects him  " that's psalm 67 "  - they're both wrong .    * miguel ,  the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the cross ,  calling on the name of christ ,  applying holy water ,  etc .  - tells jacob he doesn't believe in church and he doesn't believe in god .   ( maybe he's just conflicted ?  )  jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway .    * miguel ,  the former roman catholic priest ,  crosses himself backwards  ( or eastern orthodox-style )  .  as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest ,  he should've crossed himself forehead to sternum ,  left-side to right side of chest .   i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family ,  not just isabelle ;  but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery  ( except for the sheriff - it's pretty clear he was guilty )  .   on the positive side :  isabelle was creepy - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with claire .   i'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof .   listening to the running commentary with cameron daddo and ethan wiley ,  i'm inclined to believe it was a joke . 
0	it's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but  " caligula "  surely must hold this title .  i'm not sure what is more horrendous ;  the violence ,  the sexual perverseness ,  the acting or the plot  ( or severe lack thereof )  .   the two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous roman caesar  " caligula "  to to throne in 37ad and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power .  the acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg .  obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting ,  the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible .  but don't be fooled ,  these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film .  the camera work is shoddy ,  dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate malcolm mcdowell  ( playing caligula )  for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines .  and then there's the violence .  .  .  .   if you are about to see the film be prepared .  some atrocities are committed in the film  ( not just through the writing )  but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer .  this is only objective this movie achieved .  one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality ,  necrophilia and castration  ( just to name a few )  would be appealing to anyone .  when it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever .   you've been warned
1	'crossing the bridge :  the sound of istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that i have seen lately and is more than a film about music .  it is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city ,  one of the greatest city in europe and the world ,  one of the most important cities for europe history and for islam ,  the city that may bridge in the future europe and the middle east or may signify once again ,  as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds .   then there is the music .  the interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music ,  and we hear a lot of  ( good )  rock and rap in the first third of the film .  an then ,  like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots ,  to turkish traditional music ,  to commercial romances ,  and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of turkish music .  in such a complex and conflict ridden country as turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects ,  like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the kurdish one .  one of the best musical moments is actually provided by a kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamam  ( turkish bath )  .   one gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film .  i have never been to istanbul but after having seen this film i am sure that i want to visit this place soon . 
1	do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you've seen .  one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime  ( 1947 )  the others are always easy to get .  liberal ,  kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into trail street ,  the town's main street ,  and the sod-busters who feed our bellies .  it'll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order .  more i won't say ,  except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three .  randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor ,  courage ,  level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing .  fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values .  robert ryan co-stars in this film ,  playing a good guy for a change .  in real life ,  ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america's movies .  how sad what we get these days .  george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers ,  while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them .  hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left .  i wonder how all this plays out in liberal ,  kansas .  liberal ,  after all ,  was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named . 
0	going into the movie with the right expectations ,  i somewhat liked this movie .  like most reviewers who have seen this movie ,  i fully agree that the plot was razor thin ,  clichéd ,  and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie .  but ,  the dancing sequences were very well done ,  and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance  ( both which i enjoy watching )  .  the music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good ,  which made the  " drama "  scenes more bearable .  the leads  ( jenna dewan and channing tatum )  were ok as actors ,  but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing .   all in all ,  a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences ,  and this movie is much much much better than  " you got served "  in terms of the plot and drama .  then again ,  that doesn't say much ,  does it ?  =p
0	i really hope the makers of these  " movies "  read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies .  they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror .  whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause theyre both just plain terrible .  i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie .  stop now !  !  warning to horror movie watchers ,  dont watch ,  rent or look at the boxes of  " urban "  horror films ,  and above all ,  don't buy them !  !  !  ! 
0	what makes this movie so damn bad ?  is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor ?  could it be the horrid  " trendy "  suck ass music ?  perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story ?  or maybe even the fact that traci lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich .  regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks ,  the fact remains that it really really does .  i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i was watching in my life ,  but  " ski school "  is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty .   my grade :  f   eye candy :  nikol nesbitt ,  buffy tyler and suzanne stokes all unleash their tupperware tits  where i saw it :  starz on demand
1	spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time .  and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l . a .  punk explosion of the early eighties .  it's all there :  not just great ,  great bands like black flag ,  fear ,  x ,  the germs ,  whose names may not mean much to you today ,  but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated ,  but also the promoters ,  the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh ,  shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy ,  the anger and the fury these youths put into their music .  where is that today ?  the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music ,  but the underground was rocking .  if you need a proof for that ,  watch fear's performance in decline .  unmatched .  great film !  how come this is not available on vid ,  ld or dvd ?  p . s .  the follow-up decline pt .  ii is hilarious ,  too
0	having enjoyed neil gaiman's writing  ( especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in  " the dream hunters "  )  in the past ,  i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed .  the beginning ,  live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough .  the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with ,  and i loved the sets ,  the costuming ,  and helena's artwork .  the subsequent computer-generated scenes ,  however ,  were excruciating .  the dialogue was awkward and pretentious ,  the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying .  events occurred for the flimsiest reasons ,  and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed .  i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie ,  so i'm not exactly an authority ,  but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman's strong written work . 
1	this movie rocked !  !  !  !  saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago .  kinda a strange story ,  where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon .  don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens .  i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot .  the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl .  i think she should do more roles like this .  james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good .  david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good .  i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried .  good date flick

1	guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel ,  friendship ,  battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget ,  child actors ,  and few special effects .  something for spielberg and lucas to learn from .   ;  )  a sixth-grader kolya  " nick "  gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future .  he discovers a near-perfect ,  utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry ,  everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer .  alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals .  the device can be put to both good and bad use ,  depending on whose hands it falls into .  when two evil space pirates from saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal mielophone ,  it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy nick .  with the pirates hot on his tracks ,  he travels back to his time ,  followed by the pirates ,  and alice .  chaos ,  confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings .  alice enrolls in the same school nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in pe class .  the catch is ,  alice doesn't know what nick looks like ,  while the pirates do .  also ,  the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone .   ( hmm ,  i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator .  .  .  )  who gets to nick -- and mielophone -- first ?  excellent plot ,  non-stop adventures ,  and great soundtrack .  i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one .  .  . 
1	this is ,  without a doubt ,  one of the most accomplished debut films for any director .  the movie is only 90 minutes long ,  but manages to say just about everything about life and death .  not much action ,  and dialogue is minimal ,  but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on .  the performances by the leads are perfection ,  and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes .  the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience ,  but this is one that everyone ought to see . refreshingly unsentimental and honest ,  this is on par with ozu's works .    scratch my title ,  this one is perfect ! 
0	this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all .   it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics .   the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what  other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting .   i left the cinema feeling cheated .   needless to say i could not reccomend this film to anyone . 
0	maybe i'm alone here ,  but this is a crap show .  i'm sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil' bill o'reilly  ( which i had no idea came from this show until months later ,  and has honestly since lost its appeal )  but i gave the show a fair shot .  spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not ,  which is to say ,  he tries to be human .  fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in .  his sketches try to hard ,  he himself isn't funny ,  and the writers are struggling to write material for a no-talent host .  there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show ,  and fox .  .  .  .  . fox we had some good times ,  but you need to get your f$%*ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another  " me-too "  network . 
1	a terrific comedy-drama about the powers of friendship .  despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title ,  it would probably be compared to sex and the city .  i would not compare to it totally .  the story starts with mary ( meg ryan )  who seems to the life most women would envy ,  she's happily married ,  has a good daughter ,  great friends ,  and a great home .  but marys perfect life isn't what it seems ,  when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystal ( eve mendes )  from zach's .  mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do .  but her four good friends ,  sylvia ( annette bening )  ,  edie ( debra messing )  ,  and alex ( jada pickett smith )  try to be there for her in anyway they can .  i really don't want to give anymore away .  but i found this enjoyable ,  and i'm a man .  meg ryan is great ,  it is nice to see her in on the screen again ,  after a series of flops .  and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal .  just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy . 
1	best years of our lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years--i had heard about it ,  but never had the opportunity to watch it .  thanks to tcm on demand ,  i was able to watch it uncut and commercial free .   what surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war .  the film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war ,  both physically and mentally .  it manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters .   we have the air force officer ,  who was a veteran of the early european bombing campaign .  because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers ,  the air force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks .  such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a captain and bombardier of his b-17 .  he also suffers from ptsd ,  called  " battle fatigue "  at the time .   we have the army non-com who served in the pacific ,  and suffered through the horrors of that campaign .  his story is opposite that of the air force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant .  from the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant ,  yet he is still on the front line .   finally we have the navy seaman ,  who is part of the faceless support staff ,  commonly referred to as remfs  ( rear echelon mfers ) by the fellows on the line .  ironically ,  he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a navy ship ,  his ship is struck ,  presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives .  he is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks .   byool tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home ,  and how they readjust into civilian society .   what impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists ,  it never descends into melodrama .  the navy kid ,  played by an actual amputee ,  is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him ,  yet the script never lets us feel that emotion .  the army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic ,  and the story points that out ,  but never dwells on it .  the air force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in  ( now bought out by a large chain )  and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife .   the script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights ,  but it neatly avoids that .  but for the overly dramatic score ,  the director has tread around exploiting the obvious .   in one scene that well represents the entire movie ,  the daughter of the army sergeant  ( frederic march )  is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the air force captain .  despite his marriage ,  they have fallen in love ,  and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled .  now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears ,  slamming the door and falling on the bed .  later ,  mom shows up ,  consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom ,  and everybody lives happily ever after .   in byool ,  this scene plays out completely differently than the cliché i have described above .  sure the conversation gets heated ,  but all parties are reasonable ,  and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog i have seen .   ultimately ,  byool is a highly satisfying film ,  with honest performances from the entire cast .  technically ,  it is well shot ,  the editing and cinematography frame ,  but never overshadow the gripping narrative .  despite the score ,  which is cliché and over-dramatic ,  i give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves
0	this is an embarrassing nth rehashing of the same plot in the nth bunch-of-idiots-young-adult-in-peril-because-they-are-idiots slasher movie of the early millennium :  this time we get the story of a crazy miner who comes back from the dead to retake his gold from the hands of the usurpers .  we have almost no thrills ,  almost no bare flesh  ( even if the girls are really hot only one of them goes showing her bare ass for a few seconds )  ,  the usual bunch of sunset boulevard horror stars in cameo roles  ( this time karen black ,  richard lynch ,  john philip law ,  jeff conaway )  ,  lots of fake blood ,  only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck - well not exactly - to the screen till the end .  don't waste your time if you are not a completist . 
1	this is a wonderful movie .  i've only seen it twice ,  and i've been looking for it again for ever .  i'd buy it if i could find it .  while it's sad ,  it shows three things -- how much a man can love a woman ,  how hard some people want something and how hard people work to overcome their limitations . 
0	this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy  " a fish called wanda "  ,  although i can't see why .  the only connection i can find is the monty python one  ( eric idle in  " nuns "  ,  john cleese and michael palin in  " wanda "  )  .  otherwise the two are incomparable .   idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead ,  so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio .  when the getaway goes wrong ,  the two are forced to take refuge in a convent ,  as nuns .   what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable ,  average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour .  once again there are the occasional high spots ,  but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings .  an attempt at a  " wanda "  type manic finish fails too ,  along with the effort at  " men in drag "  humour ,  which is hardly surprising .  when you think about it ,  men trying to be women is funny ,  men trying to be nuns is ridiculous .   friday ,  april 22 ,  1994 - video
1	 " seeing other people "  is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice  ( jay mohr and julianne nicholson )  who are engaged and plan to be wed soon .  they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship .  alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past ,  she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else .  so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship .   the movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the  " what if ?  "  aspects of life ,  can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained ?  when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice - when he realizes this ,  it scares him .   i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it .  it's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today .   check it out if you get a chance . 
0	this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it ,  but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it  ( like  " battlefield earth "  or  " 3000 miles to graceland "  )  .  the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position .  beyond that ,  the jokes aren't funny ,  the characters aren't funny ,  their mishaps and missteps aren't funny .  .  . add it up ,  it's not a very funny movie !  not even at a slapstick level !  and what's with the reggae soundtrack ?  it's a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae .  seems out of place ,  don't it ?  if you like a good trainwreck ,  this is for you .  if you like a good comedy ,  look elsewhere .

1	the cell fascinated me at first glance .  i was a bit surprised about that fact ,  because the story of that movie is absolutely boring .  if it had no story ,  the film would be better .  bunuels  " un chien andalou "  comes to my mind- a film without story ,  but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images .  but the cell is at first a hollywood-movie ,  and only second a piece of art .  i'm very interested in tarsem's next project .  hamlet on indian could be very interesting ,  especially when it has the same looks as the cell .   for film music enthusiasts :  howard shore's score for the cell is absolutely marvelous ,  but a hard listening experience ,  because of its very modernistic style . 
0	whenever i see a video like this ,  i have to ask myself how it was financed .  hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot ,  to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos ,  to find people to design and light sets ,  to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music ,  etc .  but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer .  .  .  he had to have nailed all of those girls ,  right ?  and bro's not wrong about the  " spanish looking "  girl ,  but to call the cops  " stunning "  is awfully generous .  in fact ,  i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to  " hideous ,  "  or  " fugly .  "  watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body .  gross .   why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet ?  i wonder whether the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry .  .  .  one can only hope ,  right ? 
0	the best thing about shrieker is the dialogue .  like scream and i know what you did last summer ,  this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions .  unfortunately ,  shrieker is just boring .  the plot is your basic ten little indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims .  you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero ( ine )  is left to defeat the evil .  and this is exactly what happens .  absolutely no surprises and no tension .  production values and acting were ok ,  but i had no motivation to watch to the end  ( although i did )  because i already knew how the end scene would play out .  the ending did surprise me a bit ,  because it managed to fizzle out ,  literally ,  instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects .  maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end . 
0	this was not a good movie !  !  why do you people keep saying that ?  there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then bam vampires !  !  !  why ?  why are there vampires ?  where did they come from ?  also ,  what the hell ?  !  there are all of these  " super human "  vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them .  quickly too .  it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle .  there was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies !  the next thing you know ,  clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of mexico .  end of story .  literally .  oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border .  why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie ?  do not rent ,  buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house .  you will wish you had that time of your life back . 
0	this has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed . it is simply not funny and the scriptwriters have obviously just tried to use the name of the tv series in order to make a few quid at the box office .  this film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes  (  no mean feat )  ,  and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis .  a complete washout i'm afraid !  ! 
1	i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film ?  ?  its not because of money spent on it that's for sure !  !  did i see a painted water pistol in there ?  maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland ?  or maybe they just didn't have any money ?  the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds .  awesome !  but what i really liked was the grit of the performances .  mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys .  no hollywood histrionics here .   ok ,  so the effects work isn't very good .  the spaceships just don't look as good as they should in todays fx world and i've seen much better free stuff on youtube .  but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet .  was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew ?  or is it just better effects work ?  did they edit out the water ?  by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died . 
1	victor sjostrom ,  who is the grandfather of swedish cinema ,  directed this stark ,  existentialist film about atonement ,  betrayal ,  death ,  forgiveness ,  guilt ,  redemption ,  and the bleakest moments of the human condition .  he stars as david holm ,  a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways ,  only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage :  death .   unlike many silent films during the period ,  the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting .  the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar dickensian narrative .  however ,  examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time ,  it's a very daring and unique film .  audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter ,  and the cinematography is tremendous ,  symbolic ,  and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks .  it's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure .   watching the film ,  it's easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master ingmar bergman .  most of the great bergman themes are here on full display .  sjostrom ,  of course ,  later starred in bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness :  wild strawberries .  this would be sjostrom's final performance as an actor .  sjostrom based the script on a novel by swedish writer selma lagerlof .  *** of 4 stars . 
1	this is one of my 3 favorite movies .  i've been out on the water since i was 13 ,  so i got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery  ( the movie ,  although taking place in and around virginia ,  was filmed around the san francisco bay )  ,  most notably the mothball fleet just east of the benicia bridge where kelsey grammar's character was first introduced to the uss stingray ,  and the piers of san francisco at the very end of the movie  ( including a boat that i've worked on )  .  as other people have said ,  the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining .  the line  " we're approaching the bottom ,  sir !  i can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out "  is ,  at least to me ,  priceless .   i am one of numerous people who is anxiously awaiting a letterboxed dvd of down periscope to be introduced . 
1	i know gerrit .  he presently lives in the u . s .  this film is based on events in the lives of both gerrit and celeste wolfaardt .  it's a remarkable story .  it inspired me to read  " cry ,  beloved country .  "  the film is well-produced .  the music is beautiful .   the story is told in flashbacks .  you learn the stories of a white racist south african  ( gerrit )  and a black south african  ( moses )  .  their lives intersect violently .  the ending is not typical hollywood -- it's unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes .   be sure to watch through the credits -- you'll get to see footage of gerrit in real life . 
0	this movie is such a total waste of time .  i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash .  oh ,  i would have loved it when i was seven years old .  i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it .   there's no script ,  no acting ,  just rubbish .  the best acting is that by the fighting roosters .  i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough .  totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest .  i was yawning ,  and laughing ,  by the end of the first ten minutes of the film .  this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies .  great comedy ,  bad action flick . 
0	i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country  ( houston ,  dallas ,  austin/san antonio etc .  )  ,  they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers/cowboy hat  ,  talks with a drawl ,  has zero fashion sense ,  and drives a truck on his way to either the  " saloon "  or his next hunting trip ,  rodeo ,  skeet shooting or country music concert .  i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police-truck .  .  . anywhere in texas .   the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy .  .  . they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference .  the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away .  this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high-brow entertainment .  at least knightrider had the talking car . 
1	this work is pretty atmospheric ,  with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements .  i found this work more rewarding than i first expected ,  given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb .  the dialog comes across as natural and honest  ( given the circumstances )  ,  although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running ,  and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors .  typical horror movie fare .   the local characters are some of the worst clichés ,  depicting appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally challenged freaks .  the characters of the children and the principals are great !  the development given is adequate ,  and scout taylor-compton seems to be developing her talents quite well .   now ,  i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread  ( which isn't all that great by the way )  ,  but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back .  i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means ,  but there are some really good horror elements herein .  but there are also some really slow spots where plot/character development seem superfluous to the director's  ( or the film editor's )  whim .   all in all ,  this is good for a rainy night ,  but not so good for a friday/saturday night's viewing .   it rates a 7 . 6/10 from .  .  .   the fiend  :  . 
0	this is by far the worst british comedy ever ,  how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me .  the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander  ( from the fantastic coupling ) right through the cast .  the plot/story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas .  a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows .  describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog .  britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so . 
0	this was intolerable .   ( spoiler #1 )  protagonists avoid the pointless disclosure of agonizing truths to their loved ones ,  lest they surrender said status and assume the roles of antagonists .   ( spoiler #2 )  the writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions ,  by the transgressor ,  presents a threat to ,  and provokes a retaliatory response by ,  the primary victim of the transgressions .   ( spoiler #3 )  until the final 15 minutes ,  i was anticipating a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 ;  instead ,  it was kind of like discovering that lieutenant columbo's dog is the real murderer .  the story just wasn't credible ,  and i don't think the world's best director could have saved it without massive editing . 
1	first of all ,  i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary .  not only it had great music in it ,  but the shots and the editing were also wonderful .  however ,  all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist  " east meets west "  cliché that bothers many turks like myself .  okay ,  this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing ,  something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds .  however ,  the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as  " east "  from the eyes of the  " west "  .  i mean ,  like one jazz musician says in the film ,  maybe there is no east and west ,  maybe it is just a myth ,  a lie created by the ruling leaders of  " western "  countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and  " keep the cash flowing "  ?    why don't you think about that ? 
1	i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith .  babette gave them another way to look at life ;  not a replacement ,  but an enhancement .  she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her .  i see the story of god in here .  he sent his only son to man .  man could not possibly give anything that would equal that .  so ,  for our small sacrifice ,  we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it .  in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god .  babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense .  the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it .  even the film is a metaphor .  it seems slow in the beginning ,  but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end .  it was truly a feast . 
1	this film is great .  all the hi-tech machinery and technology is mind-boggling .  it is packed with action ,  humour and not to mention ,  guys .  you will want to see it again and again .  very very funny .  also ,  it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable .  you wouldn't want to miss out on it . 
1	the last person who dies before new years ,  is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for a whole year ,  picking up the souls of the dead .   i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube ,  and decided to track down the whole movie .  it was well worth the work finding it ,  because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made .  it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere .  the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere .  sadly ,  many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are ,  and go for the cheap jump scares .  the visual effects are excellent ,  considering its date of production .  if you can find a copy of this ,  i highly recommend giving it a watch .  9/10
1	this review has been written by someone who has read it  ( several times )  and knows what they are talking about !  .  firstly i have read others comments and noticed that some of the objections were really quite stupid .  people who have read the book and other jane austens or for that matter any good book ,  will know that sticking to the book is vital you have to trust an author with what they do .  if the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well it shows they do not understand jane austen and obviously are not a true fan .   firstly if the viewer truly loved the book or jane austen in general ,  watching it for four hours should not prove difficult .  secondly ,  their society did care a lot for looks and so big ,  fancy hair styles would show off how rich you were ,  which in their day was a key factor for getting along in  " good "  society .  i have to confess the female costumes were not brilliant but there were only a few bad ones and the males made up for it ,  also this prejudice for the naval men not in their uniform is in nice words very silly !  ,  today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century .  also as it goes the acting is very good ,  it is subtle because that is how jayne austen writes !  and the scene at the end is beautiful .  you can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version as technology has improved so much since them it is ridiculous to compare them in that .  the actress who plays ann is too old but her air of acting and how she does it makes up for it .   people seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that i can not comprehend !  .  it does not stick to the book at all and so is flat ,  the ending is sentimental ,  they change major scenes ,  the only good actors are the leads and they i give you did a good job for what was given to them .  obviously the people who really ,  really like it are  ( i am sorry )  stupid as they do not understand persuasion and so need it to be overdone .  the 1971 version is beautiful ,  romantic ,  was written by an excellent script writer  ( same who did inspector morse )  ,  had very good actors and really it is a film you can watch many times and during each you can be delighted with it . 
0	i didn't like underdog ! i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it . this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents ( who grew up watching the cartoon ) to come with there kids to come see this , i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest . i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent . then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad . the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic . the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude . the acting was passable but needed a little improvement . if you have kids they might enjoy it ,  but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me .  3 . 4 stars out of 10
1	i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good .  it can be easily compared with married with .  . children .  my title says that it isn't show for conservative public .  i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons .  anyway ,  show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons .  last episode opens many continuous and funny moments .  anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing .  the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes .  i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy .  war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing .  it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments .  i'm apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant . 
1	there must have been a sale on this storyline back in the 40's .  an epidemic threatens new york  ( it's always new york )  and nobody takes it seriously .  some might say that richard widmark and jack palance did it better in panic in the streets ,  but i disagree .   there is always something about these poverty row productions that really touch a nerve .  the production values are never that polished and the acting is a little rough around the edges ,  but that is the very reason i think this movie and those like it are effective .  rough ,  grainy ,  edgy .  and the cast .  all 2nd stringers or a list actors past their prime .  no egos here .  these folks were happy to get the work .  whit bissell ,  carl benton reid ,  jim backus ,  arthur space ,  charles korvin ,  and the melodious voice of reed hadley flowing in the background like crude oil .  by the way ,  i've been in the hospital a couple of times ;  how come my nurses never looked like dorothy malone ?  in these kind of movies they don't bother much with make-up and hair ,  but they really managed to turn evelyn keyes into a hag .  or maybe they just skipped the make-up and hair altogether .  anyway ,  it was pretty effective .  she plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up a case of small pox in cuba while smuggling jewels back for ultra-villain charles korvin  ( who is boffing her sister in the meantime )  .  you got the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels ,  and the health department looking for her because she's about to de-populate new york .  no 4th amendment rights here .  everybody gets hassled .   you gotta have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this .  i have a brother who scrutinizes movies to death .  if they don't hold up to his orson wellian standards ,  he bombs them unmercifully .  they must have the directorial excellence of a david lean movie ,  the score of wolfgang von korngold ,  the sound and art of douglas shearer and cedric gibbons respectively .  this ain't it .   but i have the right attitude ,  and if you do as well ,  you'll love this movie . 
1	ok ,  everybody agreed on what was the best season .  the first .  and killing off boone was a bad desicion .  also killing off others was bad .  blame the directors and writers for it .  bad boys .  but .  i still think this is the best scifi series ever !  sorry guys i can't help it !  i see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season .  still it's easy to accept liam as the new main character ,  if you are over boone .  he is really .  .  .  mysterious .  the thing that shocked me most was when lilli was written out of the story and how .  that was something she didn't deserve !  and what do we get ?  some blonde chick called renee ,  with absolutely no character !  but these taelons stay mysterious ,  and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end .  true suspence .  the conversations between zo'or and da'an are sometimes brilliant .   i understand that ,  when you jump in on an episode from the 3th , 4th or 5th season ,  you may not understand this show .  but when you watch from the beginning ,  you just cant break loose !   the acting is great ,  the special fx are marvellous ,  the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing .  gotta see this ,  guys ! 
0	bruce willis ,  as usual ,  does an excellent job .   [warning :  may be considered a  " spoiler " ]  while my friend thought it was good ,  i kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end .  after seeing such great flicks as  " the patriot "  and  " chicken run "  i was really disappointed in disney's  " the kid .  "   willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images  ( he's an image consultant )  .  an unknown kid shows up .  yes ,  it's him but younger ,  and even lily tomlin can see him .  at this point i'm reminded of a cross between a poor  " quantum leap "  episode and a bad time traveling flick .   kid and willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period .  they figure it out .  they meet willis when he's older .  nevermind that it never goes into detail how old willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with ,  how he got that knowledge to begin with ,  how he came to the realization that he needed to do this ,  and so on .   basically ,  it's a very tired ,  unoriginal ,  uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it .  the good news is that  " the kid "  actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television . 
1	ya know the concept of  " guilty pleasures "  ?  yeah ,  you have 'em ,  like admitting you watched - and enjoyed - goonies ,  battlestar galactica after they reached earth ,  v the series ,  charlie's angels ,  starsky & hutch ,  the 1950s version of superman ,  or godzilla movies .   here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures .  coupled with jack of all trades in a sam raimi action packed hour ,  this half hour slot is fast paced ,  easy to follow ,  and loaded with fun-to-watch scanlity-clad babes .   the man that brought us evil dead ,  xena ,  hercules ,  and the adventures of brisco county jr does it again with this 2000 update of charlies angels .  we got charlie  ( voice )  an unknown being that has the knowlege and the time to find people who need help ,  bosley  ( mouser )  the gadget man ,  and three gorgeous babes that kick a** for a living .   and oh what a living ! 
0	the only reason i rented this movie was that val kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie .  there is of course a first time for everything .  in many ways ,  this movie proves that oaters aren't as easy to make as we think ,  especially by foreign directors .  the only one who got by with it was probably sergio leone ,  but even his movies lacked that something indefinably innate to our american psyche and panache .  american actors in clint eastwood and henry fonda did help  .  i can see now why they changed the original title from  " summer love "  to  "  dead man's bounty "  .  that itself tells me the producers and director didn't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot'em up scenes and violent themes .  i suppose we can say the same about american directors attempting to make a polish movie while failing miserably in the process . 
1	this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while .  the actresses display a very high level of talent ,  especially rachael stirling as nan astley .  she is funny ,  seductive and cute .  the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one's sexual preference .    the characters are well defined and very believable .  i guess this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well written novel .   a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring  ( but necessary )  scenes in the beginning .   my vote :  9/10
0	it only took one viewing of this dog ,  for me to say  " never again !  "  it's so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond  ( 1 )  it was awful ,   ( 2 )  connery should have quit while he was ahead ,  and  ( 3 )  the film included a total gross-out bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most gruesome  ( not to mention horribly inefficient )  means possible .   actually ,  i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connery's bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings .  or lazenby ,  brosnan ,  or even david niven ,  for that matter .  i personally found octopussy and moonraker ,  among other  " canonical "  bond films ,  to be far more entertaining than this ,  and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the moore bond films ,  namely their wry humor ,  and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic bond milieu . 
1	one of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed ,  quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice .  the final sequence ,  with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb .   no ,  what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon ?  it leaves you breathless ,  they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion .   tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor ,  he's a nice director as well .   *my rate :  9/10
1	first ,  i loved the documentary .  it represents a new school history/theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues .   i'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first .  i hate the blair witch quality of the camera ,  but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach .  in fact ,  i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access .   dogs :  warning ,  i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession ,  so some of my training may seep in :  the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of human's great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them .  the dogs might reflect their owners ,  as one reviewer suggested .  but they also serve as a stand-in for the workers we see in the film .  while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer ,  i think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues .  no mondovi's in italy may not translate as well elsewhere .   ( yikes !  i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway !  )  it is a remarkable bait and switch .  the dogs are family ,  the workers are family .  but ,  in the end ,  the dogs are the workers  ( the last scene with the poor farmer )  .  while you may disagree with the politics ,  the artistry of the analogy ,  coupled with the more overt politics of the film ,  are wonderful .   had only faulkner  ( i am from alabama )  had the power of film beyond the hollywood market ,  what interesting tales would have been told . 
1	i don't know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie ,  this is one of my all-time favorite movies .  tommy  ( chris farley )  and richard  ( david spade )  are a great match .  tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college ,  finally passing with a d+ .  richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school .  how can you not laugh when the two of them are singing  " superstar "  by the carpenters passionatly and all of a sudden the hood pops up ?  in all this is a great movie ,  i recommend it . 
0	plants in an ancient mayan pyramid structure killing all who come close .  yes it is weird ,  as the travelers do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy .  and in a movie like this ,  i just wished it went absurd and had marching bands being attacked by plants wielding machetes .   anyway ,  a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place .  when they get there ,  mayans began shouting at them and hide on the structure .  and when there ,  thats when the plants decide to take them out ,  mimicking cell phone noises ,  humans ,  and ancient mayan dead people .   nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining .  not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap .  i kept looking for something really good to happen ,  but nothing .  oh well .

1	i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u . s .  nonetheless ,  it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies .  it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town .  the plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable .   the acting is great across the board .  sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters ,  this is a movie worth looking out for .  i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and/or buy the video . 
1	a sentimental ,  heart-tugging family film set in england of the 1920s .  a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the grand national ;  fortunately ,  ex-jockey mickey rooney is around to give liz some help .  director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands .  he and screenwriters helen deutsch and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally .  true ,  there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced ,  but overall it's quite affecting ,  and gorgeously filmed in technicolor .  the race itself is quite thrilling ,  and like so many great classics ,  there's a marvelous ,  three-hankie fade-out at the end .  liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start ,  and rooney--who i usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good .  donald crisp is terrif as liz's gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older ,  boy-crazy sister .  most of the acting kudos ,  however ,  belong to anne revere ,  who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing liz's wise and caring mother . 
0	this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least .  you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released ,  however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story ,  lack of any emmontional connection to any characters ,  and dragged out slowly scene to scene .  no build up of strong plot ,  very weak climax ,  you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie ,  if you can sit through the whole reel .  i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their  " final chapter .  "  i hardly suggest watching this flick ,  but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you . 
0	if they had a zero out of 10 i would of entered it .  everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public .  i don't know how films like this get released video or pay channel .  i am disappointed in vincent gallo .  val kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes ,  so i can't get that mad at him .  only the person who listed him to be the star in it .  it is like marlon brando in superman . there is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs .  why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows .  they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night .  there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written .  i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain . 
1	apparently this movie was based on a true story .  i'm not sure how accurate it is ,  though .  but it really reminded me of how when i see that someone has been murdered on the news ,  it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me .  sure ,  i think it's terrible ,  but i honestly don't care .  i move on .  it seems that murder is trivial now .  this is what river's edge shows .  nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death ,  not even the killer .  then what's the point ?    the killer in this story is john ,  and for the large amount of the movie he hides out with another killer named feck ,  played by dennis hopper .  feck is older ,  and you can see the generational gap .  he says he loved the girl that he killed .  when he asks john if he loved the girl he killed ,  he simply replies ,   " she was okay .  "  the movie only seems to offer one solution :  life is more important than death .  a character's life is spared ,  people get second chances ,  and one hopeless case is killed .   the acting is really good .  after watching this movie i could only come to the conclusion that crispin glover is either a brilliant actor ,  or a terrible actor .  i still have no idea .  he was my main reason to see this movie ,  though .  but the best performance is clearly given by dennis hopper .   even though the fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention then-current issues ,  i still think river's edge is as relevant today as ever .   my rating :  10/10
1	i was very disappointed when this show was canceled .  although i can not vote .  i live on the island of aruba .  i sat down to see the show on tuesday .  and was very surprised that it didn't aired .  the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled .   it's true not every one was as much talented as the other .  but there were very talented people singing .   i find it very sad for them .   that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down .   its a pity  ariette croes
1	this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long .  there was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white .  the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged .  even the dialogue was good along with the acting .  it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order .  i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying  " everyone has a box "  which he put his personal things into .  also ,  on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight ,  two other great movies .  there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it ,  even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d lloyds credit card .  i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books .  this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it ,  plus it only being an hour long .  there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant . 
0	a blind person could have shot this movie better .  .  . seriously !  the director is clearly a novice .  he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie .  i felt so embarrassed for dennis .   to john ,  the director .  .  . please retire from directing .  your contribution is not needed nor wanted .  the medium of film is stronger without you .  you are terrible at directing .  stick to bagging groceries or something .   this movie should've bypassed  " straight to video "  and gone  " striaght to the trashcan .  "  i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie .  do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the artform of film ! 
1	flawlessly directed ,  written ,  performed ,  and filmed ,  this quiet and unpretentious danish film is an example of cinema at its best ,  and if a person exists who can watch babette's feast without being touched at a very fundamental level ,  they are a person i do not care to know .   the story is quite simple .  in the 1800s ,  two elderly maiden ladies  ( birgitte federspiel and bodil kjer )  reside in remote jutland ,  where they have sacrificed their lives ,  romantic possibilities ,  and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served .  one of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a frenchwoman ,  babette  ( stéphane audran )  ,  whose husband and son have been killed in france and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate .  although they do not really require her services ,  the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined ;  indeed ,  the entire village admires and depends upon her .   one day ,  however ,  babette receives a letter :  she has won a lottery and is now ,  by village standards ,  a wealthy woman .  knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to france ,  the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly french meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation .  the meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected ,  for babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul ,  and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her .   the film is extraordinary in every way ,  meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them .  as the film progresses ,  we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to god and their all-too-human frailties ,  and the scenes in which babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful ,  beautiful ,  and incredibly memorable .  there have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love ,  but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of babette's feast ,  which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul .  highly ,  highly recommended .   gary f .  taylor ,  aka gft ,  amazon reviewer
0	 .  .  . an incomprehensible script  ( when it shouldn't have been )  dependent on a rather flaky voice-over .   the animation ,  however ,  show real talent .   quite visually impressive . 
0	i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesn't live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon .  i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off ,  the production was cheesy .  the changes in the play's script were poorly done .  if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play ,  not a hollywood movie adaptation .  the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said .  the other characters were off key as well .  a general disappointment ,  messy ,  disloyal to the play ,  amateurishly executed ! 
0	if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school ,  try to convince your teacher to see something else .  believe me ,  anything is better than this movie .  it is slow paced ,  confusing ,  boring ,  poorly constructed ,  gory ,  gringy ,  do i need to go on ?  it's message is good ,  but i have seen them been handled better in several other films .  the acting isn't even any good .  this movie is just even more awkward ,  as it start off as being funny  ( not intensional though ) because of it's surreal story ,  than at the end ,  just becomes uncomfortable to watch .   i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed .  why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes ,  than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes ,  listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear ,  witness a sort of rape ,  than see the female lead role eat her husband .   honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10 .  and if your not happy with my preview , seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism ,  but this movie was just awful .  make any excuse you can ,  to avoid this film . 
0	 " sex and the city "  has some great things going for it .  the problem is that it's saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its' six seasons .   the good things about  " satc "  is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life ,  the romance stories are interesting ,  and the characters are fun .   the bad things is that few women act like complete whores .  these four women have so many partners ,  even going lesbian in some episodes ,  that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity .  men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow ,  degenerates ,  liars ,  cheats ,  and buffoons .  the foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation entails .  why do the writers do these things ?  clearly ,  to be over-the-top and to get your attention .   another thing that bothered me  ( without spoiling )  is how some of the relationships ended .  they simply didn't ring real to me or to others i discussed this with .   but ,  even though i gave the show 2 stars ,  in the end ,  i'm glad i watched the show .  i've actually watched every season multiple times .  i do recommend the show to anyone that won't be offended by strong profanity and soft-core pornography .  i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well . 
0	i went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood ,  and this nearly wrecked that love for me .  jason lee ,  david seville in the film ,  is horrifying .  i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there ,  but i really found his performance atrocious ,  along with all the other non-animated characters .  the chipmunks were adorable ,  yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along ,  and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film .  if you feel you must see this film ,  rent it ,  at the most .  it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters ,  unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting . 
1	as a camera operator ,  i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved .  the performances were excellent ,  as was the story .  just when i thought this film was about to slow down ,  it didn't .  heart-pounding tension ,  great pacing through editing ,  and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction .  the camera was always in the right place .  love that . 
0	as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever ,  it's not bad .   it's on par with sam raimi's  " hercules :  the legendary journeys "  ,  as far as plot ,  acting ,  humour ,  and production values are concerned .  you'll see the similarities at several points .  most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that .   jack palance commands the screen as well as ever ,  and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best .  same for oliver reed .  the problem is that their strong performances make square-jawed don diamont's less-than-stellar acting skills seem even more awkward .  perennial bit player cas anvar was very good as well ,  playing a character much like salmonius in the aforementioned hercules .   if you enjoyed the low budget swords-and-sorcery movies of the early 80s ,  you're probably going to enjoy this show as well .  it's actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it .  it really has nothing to do with marco's life ,  contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie . 
0	this movie contains real animals been killed ,  like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open .  i find this totally deranged and sick ,  and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash .   this movie is so stupid and daft ,  that it has no logic at all .   there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie ,  still don't bother viewing this trash for that ,  if you want to see boobs and sex ,  watch a porno instead .  there is also rape scenes in this movie ,  which i found disgusting ,  like women been raped and cut up ,  and eaten .  this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks ,  seeing people been cut up and eaten .   a lot of the animals ,  like the monkey that appeared in this movie ,  there is none in the jungles of new guinea .  the local characters ,  most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea .  it looks like ,  this movie was made around the grounds of a resort ,  which i bet it was .   stay away from this trash ,  its sick and deranged . 
1	some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure .  i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it .  you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie .  but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people .  right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it .  well ,  if you get the privilege to watch this movie ,  after watching it remember that jack frost 2 :  revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure ,  not a guilty pleasure .  now ,  because i can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes :    **spoilers**   the three women on the beach had great deaths .  the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them .  he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her .  the next woman fell on a bed of icicles .  the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs .   the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole .  one of them gets their tongue stuck on it  ( of course )  .  jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying  " cowa-tongue-a dude !  "  .  well ,  you have to see it for yourself .   and of course ,  the snowball children kicked ass .   **end spoilers**  infinity stars
1	despite what its critics ensue ,  i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is .  eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum .  soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before ,  won oscars ,  is at the top of his game .  ocean's 12 is light ,  commercial ,  fluffy ,  steve's day at the midway if you will .  i am generally not a fan of zeta-jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie .  it's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt parlay through clooney's digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again .  if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings ,  i ask if we can drool over clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time ? 
0	the film disappointed me for many reasons :  first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role .  then ,  the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation .  the middle-eastern setting ,  man with family meets new girl overseas ,  karaoke bar ,  the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility .  this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural :  it is not .  i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film !  ?  the female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in minority report ?  and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this ?  lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes .  r-rated just for this ?  this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore ! 
1	there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short ,  which is basically ,  when daffy rides black beauty ,  it is a black woman .  i can understand partly why this joke was included ,  as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet .   aside from this point ,   " a coy decoy "  is basically a fun ,  interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books .  i liked this short quite a lot  ( despite the other reviewers on here )  .  the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing ,  yet highly amusing at the same time .  porky is a nice edition to the episode ,  though it was not vital for him to be there .  the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well ,  blood-thirsty ,  terrible animals ,  which of course they never really have been  ( unless they are very hungry )  .  i also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode .   for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons ,  enjoy  " a coy decoy "  !   available on youtube . 
0	generally speaking i don't make negative comments on here .  but since this is a festival piece ,  i don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again .   i thought the actors were pretty bad .  for instance ,  they totally didn't play off each other ,  rather ,  they waited to recite their lines which were pretty poor to begin with .  the dialogue sounded really forced .  norman or whatever his name tried ,  or so it would appear ,  to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short .   after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all  " yea "  ,  and he all but called them liars .  look there were so many clues ,  the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore .  i mean the john gave her at least 20g's .  .  .  tell tale sign .  now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred ,  i for one ,  didn't even care .  i was just glad to get out of there .  i asked him which draft he shot and he said 8 . 1 ,  maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15 . 3 cause this needed a lot of work .   but he seemed like a fairly nice guy ,  he is making his own films ,  he'll probably get better and i hope he does ,  not in a snotty way either ,  i mean it ,  i wish him luck .  just remember ,  this is just my opinion . 
0	sadly ,  this movie did have potential with such a willing cast ,  but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed .  i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud ,  as it did here .  also ,  i don't think i've ever seen a  " stoner "  sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh ,  but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery .  the last time i was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful  " big momma's house .  "  scene after scene ,  these movies will turn your brain into jelly .  silly and stupid can sometimes be funny ,  but here ,  silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer .  an absolute ,  rock-bottom dud . 
1	broadcast news opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about tv anchors who have no clue as to what they're reporting about .   at a speech before a group of would-be reporters ,  all of whom are bored by her presentation ,  most of them leave .  when the last one exits ,  the co-host of the event says quietly to holly hunter :   " i don't think there will be any q&a .  "  subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy ,  a farce about the show biz aspect of tv anchoring .   william hurt is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with holly hunter as the network anchorman .  hurt badly needs help in remedial reporting and holly refuses to take the bait--at first .  he knows he's only capable of looking good ,  but is not a reporter .  he proves to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is working and he's getting all the straight info from executive producer hunter .   holly's other anchor friend  ( albert brooks )  helps by feeding her information she passes on to hurt .  of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty-boy anchorman hurt ,  who's having his own dalliance with a pretty staff member .   you have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she'll end up with .  brooks tells her that hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against .  in this unpredictable comedy ,  there's no telling who hunter  ( the neurotic heroine )  will end up with .   fittingly ,  holly hunter ,  william hurt and albert brooks were all nominated for oscars  ( brooks in supporting role )  ,  as was the film itself and director/writer james l .  brooks .  all in all ,  seven well deserved oscar nominations .   the script doesn't opt for a conventional happy ending--and ,  in this case ,  that's the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay .  i felt cheated and somewhat let down by the wistful conclusion . 
1	of all the episodes of all series ,  this one holds the closest to roddenberry's original tenet .  according to the book the making of star trek ,  in roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers ,  he states that any alien creature ,  no matter how hideously ugly ,  impossible to believe ,  benign or malicious ,  must hold some semblance of humanity that the tv viewing public can empathize with and/or relate to .  devil in the dark's horta ,  which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung ,  is a mother protecting her babies ,  those ball-shaped silicon nodules the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying ,  because they have no idea what they are !  this is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that ! 
0	well ,  after seeing  " beginning "  i thought why the hell they burned schraders version and did that poor one .  but now ,  after seeing  " dominion "  i deeply understand this decision .  even they got it not much better .   sorry ,  but this movie is really crap .  some good moments ,  but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie .   i thing the exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see .  but there is so much little of it in the movie .  the effects are really bad - not even tv-standard . 
0	very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did :  it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old .   seeing it more than 30 years later ,  it's still okay ,  but it only mildly held my interest .  what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing .   also ,  things that were astonishing to me as a 10-year-old came across as just silly .  for example ,  in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking .  in fact ,  he doesn't even bother to look and see if they're dead ,  because he knows he hit the mark .  um ,  yeah ,  right .   in addition ,  a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden .  sorry ,  but 35 years later ,  it hasn't really aged that well .   although it's been a long time since i've seen that one as well ,  probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody . 
1	a few years ago ,  while i was renting some movies ,  i came across subspecies 4 ,  ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it ,  we need a good vampire gore flick that doesn't hold back .  but when i went back to the video store ,  they said they didn't have any other subspecies videos ,  unfortunately ,  the same went for any other video store i checked out .  i gave up ,  until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and i'm hooked .  i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series .  i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for ,  i've been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot .  radu is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs !    radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone ,  his birth rite ,  the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength .  three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man ,  stephan ,  who offers to help .  they stay at radu's castle where we find out that stephan is radu's brother ;  radu seduces and turns two of the girls ,  but stephan falls for one of the girls ,  michelle ,  and will do anything to protect her .   subspecies is a fun series ,  despite the cheesy effects ,  it makes it in some ways more likable .  plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire .  the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie .  this was also the first in the series ,  the best part is ,  the sequels are just as fun .  i would recommend this for a scary movie night ,  watch it in the dark ,  radu is sure to send shivers down your spine ,  or even your neck .  .  .  ok ,  cheesy joke ,  couldn't resist .   7/10
1	the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events ,  and i've been a wrestling fan for a good few years now .  the other shows may have better matches ,  but i've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement .   i'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review .  i will comment on the quality of them though .   we have the standard 4 matches ,  and then the big rumble event .  two from smackdown and two from raw .   shawn michaels and edge open up for raw .  this proves to be a good match from two talented guys .  this is a match i'd recommend watching .  it's hard to sum up without giving away the winner .   next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster ,  be whoever it is .  giant gonzales ,  yokozuna ,  kamala .  .  .  well this time it's heidenreich .  its also a casket match .  typical undertaker fare .  watch if you're a fan .  i have to admit i am ,  purely for the entertainment factor .  it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match .   the next two matches are the title matches .  for once smackdown manages to upstage raw .  their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable ,  but with a anti-climax and let down to end it .  raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair ,  which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved .   now to the main reason i love the event ,  the rumble .  it's a pretty good one this year .  coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win ,  and it may not prove a big surprise ,  but hey ,  its very enjoyable .  there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated .  there is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring ,  the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished ,  and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant .  it has its usual highs and lows ,  and i loved the ending ,  in particular the vince mcmahon entrance .   i'd recommend this show .  not the wwe on top form ,  but its still good .  add it to your collection . 
1	campfire tales  ( 1997 )   an excellent peace of work .  everything about this film is just perfect .   the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb .  the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films .  lets get to the main parts  1 .  there are 4 teenagers in this film  ,  after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories 2 .  there are 3 stories and the main plot  (  the 4 teenagers are the main plot )  3 .  the best story is  "  people can lick too " in my opinion .  the least scary story is possibly  " honeymoon "  or the 2nd story  ( can't remember the name "   4 .   " people can lick too "  is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl (  over the internet )  .  he starts chatting to a girl called amanda and then enters her house  .  very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of chatting to someone online .  basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy .   5 .  the main plot is sweet and simple ,  teenagers crash ,  tell stories ,  try to freak each other out .  but there's a very cool twist at the end .   the only bad part of this movie is ,  the teenagers crash their car into another couple ,  but the kids don't bother seeing if the couple are ok .  they just talk about the couple who they've crashed into .   the men and women who made this film made it to scare people ,  not to make money .  unlike  " scream "  and  " i know what you did last summer "  ,  this film is created to scare you .   " scream "  and  " i know what you did last summer "  were made to make big time cash .   even though this movie wasn't pushed as publicly as scream was  ,  it's still 10 times better than scream and  " i know what you did last summer "  .   the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics .  the cast who play theses characters are great .  christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren ,  doesn't go over the top with the acting .  the dude who plays eric  ( laurens younger brother )  also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out .  screams is like a spoof movie ,  the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb   unlike scream and  " i know what you did last summer "  ,  this movie has realistic people ,  not a goof of a movie ,  should of been more noticed . 
0	the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now .  it's the old eternal triangle again  small-town connecticut boy dave ford  ( matt long )  has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend ,  emily darrow  ( emmanuelle chriqui )  ,  on the eve of his departure for law school in new york ,  thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs ,  runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later ,  and gets involved with her romantically again .  but director and co-writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top ,  framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily ,  her husband and another one of her lovers in front of  ( here comes the spoiler )  a lesbian cop who's also a flame of emily's .  weiss overdoes the  " flanging "  effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead ,  cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal .  i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m .  cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers  ( all adapted into hit movies )   " the postman always rings twice ,  "   " double indemnity "  and  " mildred pierce .  "  it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys  ( the bad girls ,  actually )  triumphant and the decent ,  if naïve and stupid ,  hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are .  incidentally ,  though this film went straight to cable in the u . s .  there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped ,  so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world . 
1	what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of corfu ,  being greek i adore my country and i liked the flattering director's point of view .  based on a true story during the years when greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war ,  nazis and hardship .  an italian soldier and a greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make .  nicholas cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled  ( in the beginning )  love .  i adored christian bale playing mandras the heroine's husband-to-be ,  he looks very very good as a greek ,  his personality matched the one of the greek patriot !  a true fighter in there ,  or what !  one of the movies i would like to buy and keep it in my collection .  .  . for ever ! 
0	 ( chances are ,  i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point ,  then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things ,  then i suggest you hop right on to the next review .  )  you know ,  i don't mind the cult films being filed under the  " cult "  section .  and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the  " reality "  .  i mean ,  is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-christian propaganda films be filed with the other special interest movies ?    i couldn't have been more flabbergasted had pat robertson made a porn movie .   ( or would that be  " flubbergasted "  ?  )    it was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this .  it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways .  it was bad enough that it wasn't filed under special interest ,  with other cult films .  it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being  " realistic "  as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the  " debbil "  and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings -- usually in the name of religions based on the god of abraham .  it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful .   no ,  the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off ,  and declared  " i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now ,  just to get that out of my head .  preferably both ,  if you have it .  "  and we had just met her . 
0	missed it at the cinema ,  but was always slightly compelled .  found it in the throw-out bin at my local video shop for a measly two bucks !  will i now give it away to anyone who wants it ?  probably !  no purposeful plot ,  one dimensional characters ,  plastic world ripped off from many far better films ,  no decent dialogue to speak of .  you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy ?  its that feeling right here .  sad thing is ,  the australia i know is heading in this direction ,  minus the melodrama and simple answers .  interesting only to see the older aussie actors  ( who had to act back in their day to get by )  vs the newer aussie actors  ( who have to look good to get by )  .  like some horribly garish narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts .  .  .  poor kylie ,  started her career as an actress as well .  .  . 
0	awful ,  waste of time .  there is no camp or trash value in this one .  seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs .   how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians ?    it's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it .   could not find anything good about the film .  there was no plot ,  no real actors ,  no real special effects ,  no humor .  a few overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene .  nothing at all .   well ,  cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark .    purpose was probably good :  make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood .  problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally .  it takes talent and an effort to make a  " real "  movie .  ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort .  these guys lacked everything .  ed wood was a genius compared to these guys . 
1	absolutely fantastic !  whatever i say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves .  watch it now !  fantastic ! 
0	i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute .  mr .  ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate .  his co-star was very good and had the better lines .  the story intrigued me but the mistake - big mistake - as everyone is identified via driver's license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind .    i could have cared less about these people .  in fact ,  the sub-plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami .   i am disappointed in the director ,  sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films .  this one is a waste of time and energy . 
1	an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it .   the good :   the camera work was absolutely phenomenal .  every shot is done beautifully .   it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined .   david attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice .  no one could have done any better .   the bad :   there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old  (  i hold a different belief )  .    overall a tv series anyone can enjoy .  i highly recommend buying it .  10/10 stars . 
0	i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by  " cheaters spy's "  is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s-1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior
0	the story of farewell to the king is intriguing .  an american  " deserter "   ( i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion )  .  but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese .  nolte's character  ( a sergeant )  has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed .  and incredibly ,  no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him .  but anyway ,  nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman .  so he's out of the war .  then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese .   unfortunately ,  nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story .  instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war ,  now with a tribe of warriors under his command ,  nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe .  he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language ,  rarely using contractions .  he makes sweeping gestures when he talks ,  and acts like he is one with nature ,  as if he was raised in the jungle .   there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe .  but nolte's character is never believable .  it always looks like he's overacting .  he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman .  as it is ,  he comes across ,  not as a regal king ,  but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is .  but that is not the intent of the film ,  as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos .  there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange .  he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe .  thus ,  it always seems that nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film .   another actor might have done a great job with the role ,  delivered his lines believably ,  and made it an outstanding movie .  but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be .   what a waste . 
1	i am so excited that greek is back !  this season looks really eventful .  im glad that casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority .  its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent . ' i loved calvin's new haircut !  it makes him look more mature .  they should shave cappy's head ,  as well .  all the guys are hot but calvin is definitely the hottest !  i cant wait to see more of him !  i'm especially interested in what happens between calvin ,  adam ,  & rusty !  i also love rebecca .  she's really pretty .  i actually think that rebecca & calvin should hook up .  go for it ,  calvin !  join my team ! 
1	how do you describe perfection ?  in-the-mood-for-love !  maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre .  every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection ,  top-notch acting ,  and the sensual soundtrack .  nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie .  maggie and tony look marvelous ,  with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious cheongsams and tony always looking dapper .  i've seen this movie several times already ,  and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about .  love it ! 
0	tamara anderson and her family are moving once again ,  as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape .  fifteen years old ,  she is in her rebellious stage .  already angry at her father for their frequent relocations ,  her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis .  her mother's absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion ,  the boy next door ,  rusty ,  as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house .   the story is modest to a fault .  it's oddly paced ,  and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension .  the actors portraying the parents are fine .  alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother ,  and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager .  but katie boland ,  as tamara ,  is too amateurish to carry the movie .  the dialog is very natural and boland can't quite pull it off .  she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward .  one can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other actors .  she's not the only one ,  kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes .   if done right ,  the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie .  and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing . 
0	this is a very bad movie .  however ,  i read that it was made by a high-school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious  ( yet awful )  special effects .  here is the plot :  a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas ,  california and embarks on a destructive rampage .  i'm about to spoil the  " big surprise "  about what the monster looks like ,  so please read the rest of this at your own risk .  you have been warned !  the monster looks sort of like a giant ,  two-legged fly wearing a gas mask .  in some scenes ,  the monster is an actor wearing a costume .  in other scenes ,  the monster is created by stop-motion animation .  the acting is terrible .  the dialogue is terrible .  the special effects are terrible .  the plot is predictable .  stay away ! 
0	jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor  ( eternal sunshine ,  for example )  .   however ,  this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle ,  so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny ,  you will sit stony-faced throughout this film ,  as it has nothing else to recommend it .   even if you do like carrey's comedy ,  i am not sure you will find this film amusing .  i went to see it on a saturday night at 10 : 30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh .  they giggled throughout the trailers ,  which weren't particularly funny ,  but when it came to the film ,  stony silence .  i think it raised about five genuine laughs .   the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be .  it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious .  if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but  ( i'm guessing )  it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters .   the strong point of the film is the hold-ups ,  and there was plenty of potential here .  but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped .  meanwhile ,  you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates .   four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there ,  and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house  ( his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation !  )  ,  i would have done the same .  and in my entire 25 years of movie going ,  i have done that just once before . 
0	 .  .  .  why watch a tv drama  ( billed as a comedy )  in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people  ?  i can sort of see what the writer david renwick was trying to achieve :  the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into  " one foot in the grave "  ,  etc .  i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment .  but really  .  .  .  who cares about these people  ?  they are cold bores .   another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging .  that was the moment when i switched off this programme ,  never to return .   p . s .  it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british ,  whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries .  this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone .   p . p . s .  good news for those who liked it  !  there will be a second series in autumn 2007 - though without the male lead .  it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom . 
1	the academy award winning 'kramer vs .  kramer' follows a snazzy businessman ted kramer  ( dustin hoffman )  and his divorce with his bored wife  ( meryl streep )  .  one day ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life ,  forcing ted to become closer to his son  ( justin henry )  .  the two bond and become very close  ( but only after some friction )  ,  and just as everything is going perfect ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son .  ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him ,  and fights his wife in court .  dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep ,  and young justin henry is impressive .  it's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie ,  but it's a very well-made and inspiring film .  the film took the oscar for best picture at the 1979 academy awards ,  along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep .  if you don't mind a tearjerker ,  'kramer vs .  kramer' is a great film to watch .  grade :  b+
0	it's a shame ,  really ,  that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at  ( mixed metaphor intentional )  ,  because kinski and coyote - both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have wonderful chemistry together ,  and the always-provocative fairuza balk didn't hurt the mix either .  jeremy piven would have been great here too ,  if his character  ( and all the other supporting characters )  hadn't been written as a plot device .  as for the main proceedings ,  the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty-or-innocent tension for kinski's character -- instead they gave us confusion ,  contradiction and ,  by the finale ,  downright let's-hope-the-viewers-don't-notice claptrap . 
1	our family  ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience )  enjoyed  " the guardian "  .  kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake .  after seeing this movie ,  you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues .   even though this is a fictional movie ,  it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit ,  dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u .  s .  coast guard .   the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible .  you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue .   i feel the movie could have been made without the  " hollywood "  bar scene  ( when you see the movie ,  you might agree )  since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior .    very entertaining ,  very action packed ,  definitely worth seeing .  thank you ,  u .  s .  coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers ,   " so others may live "  .  i'd highly recommend this movie to everyone . 
1	i thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie .  there were certain things that could have made it better .  but kate capshaw is absolutely beautiful ,  and she showed it in this movie .  i wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her ,  but it was still a very good movie .  it was very fun to watch ! 
1	saboteur is a 1942 film ,  partly aimed at getting american support for the war against nazi germany .  propaganda or not ,  it's great entertainment .  the leading actors are robert cummings and priscilla lane ,  although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper ,  and barbara stanwyck in the roles ,  which would have given the movie more stature .  this is a good movie anyway with robert cummings and priscilla lane bringing their own style to the characters .  as in other hitchcock movies ,  we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled .  he often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent .  these upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect .  hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police .  he wanted to elevate the regular guy ,  the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously .  one can see him wanting gary cooper as an icon in the frank capra mold .  nevertheless ,  bob cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role .  priscilla lane ,  as the spunky female lead ,  comes off as the all-american girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test .  robert cummings ,  as defence plant worker barry kane ,  is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend .  this leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other hitchcock heroes on the run .  hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action ,  e . g .  madeleine carroll in the 39 steps ,  and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels .  we view scenes of america as kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of .  we see rivers ,  bridges ,  backwoods cabins ,  truckers ,  the hoover dam and finally ,  new york city .  new york is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from rockefeller center to the ocean liners  ( with a cut to the ship normandy )  and the grand finale on the statue of liberty .  great movie with uninterrupted action .  don't miss it . 
0	this movie is absurd .  absolutely terrible .  michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie .  the plot is totally not believable !  michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective ,  but then escapes .  he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital .  he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital ,  blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge  ( why ?  )  .  and to top that andy garcia  ( father of the dying boy )  and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow .  the plot is such baloney !  maybe the worse movie i have ever see . 
0	while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film ;  it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth .   the case is the use of the soundtrack music :  a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloyd-webber that plays constantly and loudly ,  and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult ;  how ecstatic ;  how tortured it is to be an artist .  and then it really counts the story elides the details at the end .   this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book :  this is not writing ,  this is barbara cartland .  precisely the same critique can be made of this film :  a deceptive ,  mawkish vanity project . 
0	do the following :  get a copy of this movie and a friend .  wager the friend $10 that they can't sit through this entire movie .  they cannot divert their gaze or be distracted by anything .  now watch your friend .  win or lose ,  you get $10 of entertainment .   it angers me to no end when people see a movie and are quick to give it 1 out of 10 ,  or sum up their thoughts with  " it sucked "  .   ( and when asked  " why ?  "  ,  they respond ,   " just because .  "  arrgh .  )  that is why this movie exists .  it's sole purpose is for me to say ,   " there !  this is a horrible movie !  that is 1 out of 10 !  "  .   this movie is absolutely appalling .   while the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly formulaic ,  this movie falls short in every single aspect .  it's not funny .  it's not entertaining .  and for some of the parodies ,  it's completely inaccurate !  horrible acting .  unfunny dialogue .  a witless story .  terrible  " special effects "  .  one inane gag after another .  and to make matters even worse ,  there isn't even gratuitous nudity to somehow make it even fleetingly worthwhile .   this movie leaps past idiotic ,  stumbles over stupid ,  and lands face first on moronic .  even i ,  who loves a good  " check your brain at the door "  movie ,  found myself physically agitated watching this .  this movie isn't even  " hard ticket to hawaii "  so-terrible-it's-good bad .  .  .  it's just bad .   note :  i actually challenged a friend to watch this as described above .  not only couldn't he make it all the way through ,  but he had a headache and needed a couple minutes afterward because he felt a little ill .  true story .   i could not accentuate this rating any more .  .  .  a resounding 1 out of 10 ! 
0	for me , this is not a good tv show , animated or otherwise . it is however , annoying to the nth degree . there are a few reasons for this , in no particular order . first , the intro of one of the most pointless , and annoying characters ever , batmite . this character serves no purpose for the show , whatsoever . maybe it is intended as comic relief , but it doesn't work out that way . next up , the joker . i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character let loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence . talk about repetitive . this gets old really fast .  . also don't think the had the right actor to voice the character . it just doesn't sound at all like the joker should sound . lastly , they made robin look like a complete dork . other than these problems , the show isn't that bad . but these are big enough problems to drastically lower the likability factor . for me ,  " the new adventures of batman "  is a 3/10 , at best . 
0	what a turd !  i like john leguizamo but man this is bad .  i thought spawn was the worst movie he had been in ,  but i was wrong .  i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace ventura 2 to american werewolf in london .  this is a piece of trash . 
0	after the general ,  a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick ,  along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr .  lynch or martin cahill ,  aka the general ,  the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub ,  and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan .  in short ,  is the movie worth a look .  .  .  .  no ,  unless u like bad acting with hilarious 'proper irish accents ,  ah sure to be sure to be sure' .  the story is ripped off from the commercially successful 'the general' which ,  despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look ,  on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin ,  and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast ,  including john voight .  all in all ,  'ordinary decent criminal' is anything but a decent film .  avoid . 
1	dark and bleak sets ,  thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife  ( or razor )  a perfect cast lead by broadway greats hearn and lansbury .  this is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen .  sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and todd is his masterpiece ,  from the brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous act i finale-  " a little priest "  where lovett and todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies  ,  this play never ceases to thrill , excite and satisfy .  betsy joslyn also excels as johanna ,  even she ,  as the plays ingenue seems slightly mad . edmund lyndeck turns in a bravado performance as the corrupt judge who lusts after joslyn and is the subject of todd's vendetta .  lansbury and hearn command the show as only two great actor/stars can do .  other musical highlights include todd's  " johanna "  lovett's  " worst pies in london "  and the act ii opening 'god thats good "  ,  and that is a title to describe this production  ! 
0	this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end .  complete garbage !  the acting ,  the plot ,  set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot .  not even a b move . 
0	 " graduation day "  was released in may 1981 ,  during the height of the slasher film craze .  earlier that year ,  fans had been subjected to flicks like  " my bloody valentine "  ,   " just before dawn "  ,   " friday the 13th part 2 "  ,  and  " the burning "  and theaters still were expecting flicks such as  " halloween ii "  ,   " the prowler "  ,  and  " happy birthday to me "  .  i have seen all of these films ,  and out of all the popular 1981 slashers  " graduation day "  is by far the worst .   what  " graduation day "  amounts to is an exercise in poor ,  low-budget film-making with bad acting ,  bad writing ,  pointless characters ,  pointless scenes ,  unneeded nudity ,  cheesy dialogue ,  and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well .  and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film  ( the opening scene's music is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene )  .  however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film .  so why isn't  " graduation day "  considered a classic like  " halloween "  ,   " friday the 13th "  ,   " a nightmare on elm street "  ,   " my bloody valentine "  ,   " the burning "  ,  or  " prom night "  ?  why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care ?   where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing .  there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher ,  and  " graduation day "  moves pretty slow .  the most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up ;  there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim .  there's a sleazy teacher ,  a stressed principal ,  a cunning secretary ,  a dopey school security guard ,  a clueless detective ,  an alcoholic step father ,  a mindless grandmother ,  and a mom to an earlier victim still grieving .  all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed ,  but they are all wasted .  the worst part is that the story still focuses on them ,  and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character .  but for what ?   what does amaze me about  " graduation day "  and its small fanbase is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes .  fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in  " the burning "  ,  the washing-machine death in  " my bloody valentine "  ,  the kabob death in  " happy birthday to me "  ,  the upside down death in  " friday the 13th part 3 "  ,  and hot tub death in  " halloween ii "  ,  and even the car hood death in  " madman "  .  but where is the respect for some truly unique  ( even though cheesy )  deaths in  " graduation day "  .  one victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword ,  while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin .  the best death includes spikes under a landing mat .  why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films ?    " graduation day "  tries hard to be a great and unique film ,  but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience .  its not the worst of its kind  ( try checking out  " don't go in the woods .  .  .  alone "  )  and there is a bit of suspense ,  plus it delivers just what fans are looking for  ( blood ,  gore ,  nudity ,  sex ,  and nostalgia )  but  " graduation day "  will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made .  it's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low-budget - however it is a question of ideas ,  creativity ,  and craftsmanship .  that's all any type of movie making is .  .  .   recommended for hardcore slasher fans .  general horror fans might get a little bored ,  and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear .  it's not the worst slasher film ever made ,  but its a long way from being the best . 
0	this is a snuff movie .  i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library .  and ,  bill ,  julia ,  and all other  " professional "  actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick .  i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent .  .  .  . that usually make no sense when writing a horror film ,  but as a viewer ,  we try to rationalize and understand .  this ending was not creative .  it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie .  i am shocked it was edited to this ending ,  and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009 .  it should not be shown in a theater .  it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels .  .  .  . watch the movie ,  the ending ,  and you will understand this statement .  plus ,  included in the plot is a sweet little girl  " not yet 9 "  her character says .  she is not in the snuff ending ,  but she is an integral part of the movie .  why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition ?  the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film . 
1	i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr .  who .  i've played them over and over .  i adore each of the  " doctors "  for different reasons .  but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy ,  dr .  who was canceled ,  even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line-up .  with the departure of sylvester mccoy ,  the doctor stayed alive through the fans .  bbc graciously allowed fans to write books ,  and cartoons .  the momentum of dr .  who has been steady even after 1989 .  then they took a chance with paul mcgann .  the movie was flawed ,  but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted .  in 1999 ,  the  " man "  was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back .  it was a complete success .  here in america ,  the sci-fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well ,  although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr .  who mythology for new viewers .  it is incredible to me that they have done it .  in season 1 ,  staring christopher eccleston with russell t .  davis as lead writer ,  and phil collinson as producer ,  the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is .  the doctor who universe has always been about  " choice "  ,   " love "  and  " sacrifice "  .  this is what they provided .  it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr .  eccleston has chosen to leave the show .  my first doctor was doctor no .  3 ,  jon pertwee's doctor .  mr .  eccleston needn't worry about his position in the dr .  who universe .  it is as solid as the rest .  he is the 9th doctor .  i didn't know of mr .  eccleston prior to his performance in dr .  who ,  but i do now .  i wish there was some way ,  he could know ,  there is push out in the dr .  who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it .  we have already seen that he is a great actor . 
1	i saw the movie in izmir as the closing film of izmir film festival .  i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see ding-a-ling-less !  it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen zillions of movies !  !   ( i'm a film critic !  )  clever script and dialogs .  .  .  smart details .  .  .  what else can i say ?  an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor .  .  .  one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now .  ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director onur tukel is more mature now .  i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like  " house of pancakes "  .  .  . 
1	this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for  ( and comment on )  it .  i've only recently come to appreciate well-produced  " war "  movies ,  and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen .    " stunning "  is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience .  my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time .  it is gently moving ,  yet exciting at the same time  ( not a contradiction )  .  this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy ,  action-packed ,  top gun time-waster .   the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well ;  and krystof hadek is a very  " pretty "  boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact .  in terms of hadek's acting ability and appearance ,  my husband said  ( tongue-in-cheek )  ,   " well ,  he's no tom cruise .  "  i replied ,   " thank god !  "  if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting ,  see this one . 
0	usually i'm the one criticizing the twenty-something neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t*ts ,  gunfights and car chases .  however ,  in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions .  at least i wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels .   i don't mind surreal ,  and i certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning ,  but there should be some point to the whole thing .  i didn't get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were ,  instead ,  just so self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered .  or perhaps they just got confused themselves .  either way ,  i don't care .  it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace .   although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography ,  i must respectfully disagree .  perhaps i didn't mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals  .  .  .   or perhaps this movie was just crap .    i give it a  " 1 "  and file it next to  " ishtar .  " 
0	a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley  ( sic )  just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed .  it's the end of the world .  four men with guns ,  two women ,   ( one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie ?  )  time passes ,  tensions develop  ( or are supposed to )  .  something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits .  a mutant monster !  seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed  " a million years of evolution "   ( on an already living human )  the result is a laughably bad ,  zip up the back ,  rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water .  it rains .  the monster dissolves .  the remaining two characters ,  the hunk and the virgin .  set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there' .   the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain acting' that goes on in it .  one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the superabundant use of curtains in the set design .  it was cheap .  finished with one set-up ?  pull a curtain across ,  drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting .   'curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in  (  " it looks like rain "  ,  or  " here they come now ,  and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them !  "  ,  that sort of stuff )  .  he'll do this by standing to one side of the window - reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot - ie towards the camera - thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen ,  without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains .  there was a lot of that in this movie . 
0	this is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a soapie .  it may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of 1950s us thinking ,  but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline ,  wooden acting and grating style .  there are some interesting photos of long-gone aircraft ,  but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length . 
0	there was no need for this movie ,  plain and simple .  the original ,  although hated by some ,  was something i found to be actually really entertaining ,  mainly because it was before jim carrey started to really lose his touch ,  and cameron diaz was ,  well ,   " smoooooookin !  "  'nuff said .  so why make a sequel/prequel thing ?  honestly ?  knowing that jim carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created .  but then they just make mistake after mistake .  jamie kennedy .  why is this man still allowed to breathe ?  the writing and story :  terrible .  why would i ever want to see a baby wearing the mask ?  moreover why would i want to see it fly ?  ever ?  how did someone think this was a good idea ?  !  the acting is despicable ,  in fact nearly everything about this movie is .  i'm trying to keep calm ,  or imdb probably won't let me post this .  bottom line :  don't watch this piece of trash .  pick up the original ,  see how good cameron diaz looked and how jim carrey used to have a career ,  and laugh .  don't waste even a second of your time on this . 
1	i really enjoyed this movie for what it is :  a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously .  plot summaries are available everywhere so i won't go into details .  michael isn't about a complex plot anyway .  it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip .   john travolta's performance as a chain-smoking ,  lady-loving ,  bar-brawling ,  pie-eating angel is just perfect .  and who doesn't love sparky ?   watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time .  highly recommended . 
0	this movie is by far the worst movie ever ,  the story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after the 20 was left they hands .  this really bugs me .  it drags on and on with out any meaning ,  very boring .  the only good thing was the cast ,  wow ,  lots of big time actors and actress in it .  but besides that it was horrible ,  terrible and repulsive ,  do yourself a favor ,  do not watch it .   i gave it a 1 out of 10
1	i've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it .  and what do you know ,  i actually liked it !  it has a new twist of the 18th century england .  although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of liv tyler's clothers  ( although it is pretty !  )  ,  it fit quite perfectly .   if you just want a good time ,  you should check this out .  very different from other 18th century detailed films . 
0	romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for  " bellow from average "  movies and source of frustration for viewers .  this one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my  " top ten worst movies "  .   history is far from creative and jokes are weak .  i found no reason for a single laugh during all the movie !  characters are plain and the performance of the actors and just good .  history develops slowly ,  it's tedious and foreseeable .  ending is also foreseeable and sugar-coated .   this is one that movies you watch in a rainy saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion . 
0	i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary .  one reviewer on four word film review  ( www . fwfr . com )  got it right right when he wrote ,   " from a to zzzzzzzzz .  "  the story is about an english colonialist jerk that comes to malaysia to  " civilize the savages "  so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary .  a sleeping dictionary is a native malaysian prostitute fluent in english that services englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for  .  .  .  well the movie never really makes that clear ,  but i can only assume he gives her money or something .  needless to say ,  the movie focuses a lot more on the  " sleeping "  part than on the  " dictionary "  part of the job description .  things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture ,  his soap opera domestic situation ,  and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film .   so yes ,  the movie has some major flaws ,  but on the other hand ,  it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place :  a beautifully photographed exotic location ,  and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary ,  jessica alba .  my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right .  she's not a great actress ,  and doesn't quite pass for malaysian ,  and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity ,  but who cares ?  jessica alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy ,  but also beautiful in the way that a vivaldi violin concerto or a rembrandt painting is .    ( p . s .  sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women ,  the  " male gaze ,  "  etc .  etc .  ,  but i hope you can understand that i mean no disrespect .  ) 
1	 " tale of two sisters "  has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently .  in the end there is no actual supernatural element ,  despite what one is led to expect throughout the film .  the story seems to be about two sisters ,  who ,  upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence  ( later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution )  are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi-polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time .  ,  but some presence as yet unexplained .  it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead ,  and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister ,  who was unable to save her ,  and her step-mother ,  who was callous enough to let her die .  much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film ,  but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion .  definitely not light viewing ;  watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen .  it's a hell of a puzzler . 
0	as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed ,  diane arbus  ( nicole kidman )  can be excused as an early flower child .  the film itself deserves no such latitude .  the lack of character development ,  motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing .  i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke .  that the few facts presented did not match diane arbus' life very much did not help to clarify things either .   the washed out art direction in diane's 'normal' life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening' life with lionel .  and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family  ( however ,  i don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her's )  .   maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment .  i also would have liked to see at least one of diane's photos as well .  i won't wait for the sequel . 
1	anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside & puff a couple .  great story .   reality is for people who can't handle drugs . 
0	honestly ,  this movie is weak .  very weak .  only capital character can something .  she's work like supercharger on bad engine .  .  . so ,  if you like red-haired valkyries - see that .  but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop .  it will save of disappointments .  well ,  arnold also do his deal .  .  . but it definitely not best his role .  other characters - bad is not that word .  sword fights ?  monsters ?  ridiculous .  plot is really shame .  why was necessary rape she ?  especially ,  we don't see it .   anyway movie is weak .  though worse movies exist .  .  . without main characters it would be just ****** .  and if somebody even discusses it ,  maybe .  .  . 
1	this is no walk in the park .  i saw this when it came out ,  and haven't had the guts to watch it again .  you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie .  i felt like i'd been severely beaten .  what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage ?  this is our world ,  what we have created ,  what we have allowed to happen .  and i would hesitate to say that i-me-we are not responsible for this .  babenco made this film to wake us up ,  to shake us to our very core ,  and he succeeded .  how can we be cruel ,  or self-indulgent ,  or neglectful of our children ,  when we see the graphic results of such behavior ?  he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society .  and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it ,  then you are part of the problem .  i am not a religious fanatic ,  but this movie made me think about the state of my soul . 
1	after reading over all these reviews i'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show  " m squad "  starring lee marvin ,  i read reviews comparing it to  " dragnet "  and some of the quinn martin police shows ,  but if you watch m squad you'll see it was based on it .  in the late 1958 episodes of m squad onwards ,  you'll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot at , and he shoots back ,  the beginning of police squad is basically the same  (  including the jazz music )  and then lee marvin narrates what goes on ,   ( im lieutenant detective frank ballinger , m squad , a special department of the chicago police )  and in police squad leslie neilsen does the same  ( im detective lieutenant frank drebin ,  police squad ,  a special division of the police department )  and so on ,  in one of the m squad episodes there's even the johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a m squad episode entitled  "  more deadly "  there's a police squad episode entitled  " a substantial gift  ( the broken promise )  "  which is the same story ! 
1	i found the film don't look in the basement to be very good ,  with some great characters in it .  it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte beale ( rosie holotik )  , who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum .  whilst there ,  she meets various sorts of different characters including dr .  geraldine masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr .  stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe .   my favourite characters in the film are mrs challingham ( reah macadams )  ,  a very funny little old lady ,  allison who is a nymphomaniac ,  and sam ( bill mcghee )  a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time .  the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film .  i know that it was on the 'video nasties' list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it ,  alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended !  !  !  . 
1	as a zombie fan ,  i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters !  pb is also an excellent tie-in to chronicles of riddick  ( cor )  .  the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness .  there are so many metaphors in the story !  riddick is this bad guy ,  but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks .  the muslim guy ,  imam ,  relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers ,  but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule .  overall ,  i recommend this film to any sci-fi fans .  you won't be disappointed . 
0	thomas hardy is one of my favorite authors .  some truly wonderful movies have been made from his novels  (  " far from the madding crowd ,  "   " tess of the d'urbervilles ,  "   " the mayor of casterbridge "  )  ,  and i had high hopes for this one .  the hallmark-hall-of-fame-ification of  " return of the native "  totally wrecked it .  the cast was terrific ,  the photography excellent ,  but the script was dismal and the direction positively ruinous .  people walked up to people ,  said lines ,  walked away .  a meager excitement developed when clive owen and catherine zeta jones  ( very young ,  very beautiful )  exchanged a bit of flesh-pressing ,  but even clive ,  who is a superb actor ,  couldn't save it .  it was awash with the usual hallmark  " romantic "  strings background music and pretend bumpkins offering plot exposition ,  and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful .  the richness of the above three movies was commpletely absent . 
1	robert deniro and eddie murphy ,  what a team .  while rene russo ,  william shanter ,  and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride .  this is a funny and a great movie .  not only is it that ,  but it's a good buddy flick .   tom dey  ( shanghai noon )  directs this hell of a movie .  from start to finish ,  it was a masterpiece .  no slapstick humor here .  but good old time laughs .  making fun of all other cop flicks  ( to name a few lethal weapon ,  beverly hills cop ,  fifteen minutes ,  and etc .  .  .  )   if you want to see a movie ,  see this one .  you'll love it .  it has a wonderful cast and crew .  so ,  get off your a** from watching  " cops "  and watch  " showtime "  for a cop film .  and remember ,  they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um .  .  . um .  .  . oh !  at friday nights at 8 : 00  ( man ,  everyone says i'm a bad writer )  . 
0	bette midler is the best thing about this movie .  it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy .  the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better .  bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia gibb .  only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie .   there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl .  when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show .  when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant ,  it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star ,  not just a poor substitute to her sister .  and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through .  it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it .  it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original .  it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie .  i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off . 
0	this is about some vampires  ( who can run around out in the sunlight )  ,  that are causing some problems down in south america .  casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate .  the movie opens with van dien & co .  walking through the jungle ,  and there's this huge black guy who just absolutely ,  positively cannot act .  he speaks all his lines as if he's reading them off the cue-cards for the very first time .  his voice is also so low that ,  well ,  it's positively hilarious .  great way to get the movie started !  anyhow ,  they run into some of our vampires ,  shoot them  ( this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds )  ,  and then of course they come back to life .  van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb ,  and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood .  the stunt work must be seen to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees ,  which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily ,  but it just makes them look like they're bouncing around on bungee cords or something .   yeah .  .  . anyhow ,  later on ,  the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys  ( van dien not included )  ,  and they're attacked by more vampires .  it's really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow ,  because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with ,  but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand .  the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader .  van dien ends up battling him later on .  it doesn't help that all through the movie ,  everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire ,  they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so ,  which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily .  they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand-to-hand combat .  yeah ,  not exactly brilliant tactics .   there's a hot babe  ( remember veronica from the lost world tv show ?  yes ,  it's her !  )  who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission ,  and she also just happens to be van dien's ex-wife .  hey ,  what are the odds ?  it's a shame she's not in the movie a whole lot more than she is .  will her and casper get back together in the end ?  will van dien defeat the huge black dude who can't act ?  will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes ?  will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny ?  has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo  ( she's more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials )  ?  these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie .   i don't know ,  it might score some points on the so bad it's good scale ,  but that's about it .  eh ,  it's a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle ,  i guess it's kind of entertaining . 
0	i saw this film without knowing much about it at all .  the split screen device was immediately irritating ,  and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence had finished .  the plot ,  characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched - poor guy from abusive family gets thrown out of home ,  wants to get out of his 'lot' ,  reinvents himself ,  changes his voice ,  dresses in others' clothes ,  is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to disgard on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking british aristocrats .   the estate of patricia highsmith  ( talented mr ripley )  should be suing the makers of this film .  the triple screen to me ,  together with the over 120 min duration ,  emphasises the almost non existent editing .  can't decide which image works and is the most powerful ,  why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them .  this gimmick removed any connection or interest i had with any of the characters .  important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen ,  as if to say 'this is an important / moving / deep moment ,  ok ! ' .   don't waste your time .   
0	okay ,  so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode ,  thinking it was the first or second .  honestly ,  i thought cm would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points .  the rangers are left stranded on the plains  (  " we'll have to eat the horses "  )  ,  for one thing .  little newt is bereft ,  for another .  what a downer ending !  but my biggest complaint ,  esp .  if this was the finale ,  is that the episode had no suspense ,  no big climax ,  no dramatic confrontations .  even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo hump was badly staged .  the whole episode had terrible pacing ,  which is what drives a western .  steve zahn was watchable ,  karl urban  ( a ringer for johnny knoxville )  played call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw .  all glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin .  and what's with the rangers ?  they talked big ,  about cleaning up texas ,  then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town ,  getting drunk .  and how nice of hal holbrook to loan val kilmer his mark twain wig and stache !  the set of austin was like the fake rock ridge from blazing saddles ,  all facade .  i admit i was drawn into the plot ,  but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get ,  thanks to coming in late in story .  if i'd watched from the beginning ,  i might not have gotten to episode three .  now i have to go watch silverado to cleanse my palette . 
1	what a tribute to his father !  he set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of ,  and by the end of the journey ,  i believe nathaniel kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt .  the film is 5 years in the making ,  and a quarter of a century after his death ,  louis i .  kahn's total commitment in his work - consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world ,  with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son nathaniel in the documentary  " my architect :  a son's journey "  .   the film is by no means an anthology of louis' work .  there are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of louis kahn's projects and buildings .  this documentary works like a mystery ,  writer-director and co-producer nathaniel kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father .    the film is in chapters .  in  " heading west ,  "  we're at the salk institute for biological studies at la jolla ,  california .  it's a sight worth beholding - kahn's integral concept of building and environment ,  optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing .  from a former colleague who worked with 'lou' 35 years ago ,  we hear about his meticulous attention to detail ,  also how 'rambunctious' he could be - certainly didn't mince words in his criticism .  a memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the salk institute - a tiny figure ,  like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands .    the  " immigrant "  segment brought us to meet anne tyng ,  the architect who collaboratively worked with 'lou' and also bore him a daughter ,  alex .  now at 80 ,  tyng's return with nathaniel's film crew to the bath house project at trenton ,  new jersey ,  was nostalgic .  in  " go to sea ,  "  we get to see the barge for american wind symphony orchestra - all made of steel ,  and meeting robert boudreau ,  who was surprised by nathaniel when he finally told him he's 'lou's' son .  boudreau was touched ,  he said he had seen nathaniel when he was six ,  with his mom  ( harriet pattison )  ,  and he was not to tell anyone that lou had a son .  it was a 'chokingly' emotional moment of reunion .   like his father  " the nomad ,  "  nathaniel traveled to jerusalem ,  and learned about the synagogue project that his father began but not realized .  he visited the wailing wall ,  and seeing his yarmulke kept falling off/being 'breezed off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be 'totally' jewish to be his father's son .  we continue with sitting down with his two half-sisters at the  " family matters "  segment .  we also hear him conversing with his mom at maine ,  and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office ,  we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there ,  sleeping on a carpet on the office floor ,  weekends and all .     " the end of the journey "  brought us to ahmedabad ,  india ,  to the indian institute of management building .  talking with architect b . v .  doshe was a revelation .  in the end ,  nathaniel found a very much alive louis kahn ,  his father - his spirits live within him .  this documentary is very much a tear-jerker for me .  i was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very touching and am in awe of the man ,  the architect and his son ,  and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings .  louis i .  kahn wanted to give his love to the 'whole world , ' juggling work and three families  ( you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going )  .  as shamsul wares ,  the architect at the capital of bangladesh complex  ( completed 9 years after 'lou's' death )  so poignantly noted :  louis kahn has given the people of bangladesh a lot ,  spending time at bangladesh ,  understanding the culture of the place and people - as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved ,  and for such a dedicated man ,  usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing .  it seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices .    this film reminds me of king vidor's  " the fountainhead "  1949  ( good dramatic story in b/w with music by max steiner )  ,  based on ayn rand's novel ,  with gary cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals ,  and patricia neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life .   
1	i have been trying to track the age of kings down for many ,  many years . my theater life was filled with the actors in this series .  at the time ,  in 1960 i was not able to follow all of it ,  as i was myself working in the theater ,  lots of night work .  now in retirement i long to have this and keep it to myself .  please ,  please can it not be issued on dvd ,  i would not mind what it cost .  i see that there are others out there who feel the same .  what can we do to get this done ?  something as great as this should not be sent into oblivion .  i have to write two more lines .  ok i can do that by saying that i want this series more than anything in the world .  just to be able to watch some of the finest actor of our age playing out the finest words of our wonderful shakespeare .  isn't that enough !  a uzmen
1	nothing better than an android boasting 80's technology and a coming-of-age storyline to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind front and center to be taken captive by a beautifully lovable cast .  growing up in the 80's gave me the priceless opportunity to see re- runs of  " not quite human "  on many special occasions .  considering the fact that my parents were never present during the viewings ,  i would guess that i would most likely not enjoy it near as much as i did as a child .  so perhaps this is a film to dig out of your vhs collection and hand to your kids ,  it can be found on the same tape as  " the apple dumpling gang "  and an episode of  " tour of duty ,  "  that is if you recorded in lp mode of course . 
1	if you only see one ernest movie in your life ,  make it this one !  this is by far the best in the series ,  with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages .  the other  " ernest "  flicks were good too ,  but most people tend to get tired of him quickly  ( not me ,  however .  )  .   in this movie ,  ernest p .  whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case .  the murderer ,  nash ,  just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest .  mr .  nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him ,  and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer .   a great flick !  if you haven't already seen it ,  watch it ! 
0	another tiresome bore from anthony minghella ,  who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes .   the story centers on inman  ( a somnambulent jude law )  ,  who goes off to the civil war having just barely started a sort-of romance with nicole kidman ,  a preacher's daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town .  the story cuts back and forth between inman's trials and tribulations at war  ( which is ,  guess what boys and girls ?  hell !  !  )  and kidman's trials and tribulations back at home  ( which are ,  very predictably ,  incredibly boring )  .  renee zellwegger appears on kidman's farm to help kidman get it back into shape after kidman's saintly daddy dies of inconvenient character disease .  zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that granny clampett kind of way ,  dispensing enough tough love and homespun wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of touched by an angel .   this film is ,  quite simply ,  excruciating .  avoid it like the big bloated oscar-bait bogus pretentious literary adaptation nonsense that it is . 
0	seven pioneer kids strive independently across many miles of indian territory and harsh weather to reach oregon .   according to history ,  young'uns who traveled by themselves through long distances of land - such as with the 'children's crusade' - were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery ,  but these kids are pretty tough and they try their best to prevail in accomplishing their goal of making a homestead out west .  film is a little too syrupy at times ,  but ok for fans of 'the waltons' and 'little house on the prairie' .   dean smith gives a cool performance as 'kit carson' . 
0	i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious .  i liked movies about mythological creatures .  i like movies about werewolves ,  vampires ,  zombies ,  etc .  this is based on half-caste ,  a half-human half-leopard creature that preys on the people of africa .   the movie is horrendous !  the actors are terrible !  there is no script whatsoever !  it's all improvised !  the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it .  it's obvious bull*bleep* !  they film at night to make it scary .  but ,  they have failed to scare me .  after the first person was killed ,  i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster .  one of the most boring movies i've ever seen .   now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i haven't finished it .  well ,  this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through .   1 star out of 10 .  this is really bad ! 
1	i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom ,  her best friend and my adult sister .  disney world is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children ,  but when you see quality shows like mickey's philharmagic ,  you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone !  it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again .  and then a third time .  it was absolutely breathtaking .  i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show ,  which is not just a show but a world wind ,  fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble ! 
1	i love this movie .  i just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it .  this movie is so funny .  there are two times that i was laughing so hard my sides hurt .  i didn't expect to watch a movie so funny ;  i really only wanted to see it because laura fraser is in it .  i first saw her in titus which is an awesome movie as well .   like others reviewers have said ,  too many people are expecting a deep moving film .  you are not going to get it .  what you will get is humor ,  eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them .  you can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex .   a hilarious sequence involves justine first seeing herself as a naked man .  i was cracking up .   i swear ,  this movie is the most imaginative teen film that i have ever seen and it is now my favorite .   just remember why movies were originally created ;  as entertainment not philosophy in motion .  remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality .
