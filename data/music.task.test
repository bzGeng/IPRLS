1	if you liked the original clerks soundtrack , then you 're sure to love this . thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack , now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is , in fact , the real trilogy . and we , the clerks fans , get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track . oh , and did i mention the music ? terrific ! kevin smith 's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie . it 's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time . in typical kevin smith fashion , the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises . you 've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number . if you have not seen the movie , please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack . doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them . overall , a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan .
0	i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these ... ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except `` dog eat dog '' which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an '80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly can not accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , `` dog eat dog '' ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul
0	i was so disappointed with this cd . at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums ... .scratches and all ! they were so bad . i play two of the songs over and over ... the only two i liked . when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs , i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song ... .i was wrong . i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music..a filler ? i would quickly skip to another song ... only to have to `` skip '' many times !
1	five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics , but when compared to similar cds within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre , this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines . i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest . the writing , while occasionally a bit awkward , is consistently interesting , honest and moving . the themes of introspection , nostalgia , regret , and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner . the song `` if i were a man '' is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world ; `` child of steel '' plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy ; and `` take my body '' is a strong lament about the objectification of women . i especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements ; the simplicity really works with ms. cash 's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments . i 've seen ms. cash perform live and , while she has other hits that may be more popular , this collection reveals her unique brilliance
0	it is beyond me that a record label would put this out . it 's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure , subject the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors .
1	robbie 's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination . to have a cd that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something i feel so honored to have in my possesion . hats off to robbie
0	the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo , using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him . it 's the only scene that made me laugh . the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home , and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids , are both weak . playboy dad is not interesting , and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie . the other dad , reiser , is uncomfortable to watch . his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter , but that too is uncomfortable to watch . the later scene , up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him , is completely unbelievable . the fact is , that particular girl would not say those things to her dad . she does n't love him . she does n't need him at all . she 's done with him . the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb . that does n't happen . if you want to write a cartoon , get warner brothers to draw it for you . have the road runner in it , or bugs bunny . the film gives us comfort food at the end , with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids . the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young , but once they hit a certain age , in double digits , you are done . daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on . kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad . fittingly , i saw this film on father 's day . to sum the whole movie up , janeane garofalo is funny , randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end , and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying . the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on . but it takes a subject on , so at least that 's something . it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family
1	ms. melua is from georgia . her voice is quite like the swede , lisa ekdahl . neither has range or power ; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse . both have musical partners . in ms. melua 's case it is mike batt who is to her what nelson riddle was to linda rondstadt , except that , in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching , he writes songs . most of this album are her and/or his songs . they are well written and well treated . they are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners . mr. batt , among many other things , worked with steeleye span and art garfunkel long ago . the original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition . but my favorite cut is her rendering `` blues in the night '' , which some might remember from looney tunes cartoons many decades past ; `` my mama done tole me ... '' it starts . knowing she can not belt it , instead she works it . one short note on steve sale 's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all , clipping . perhaps because i bought it on vinyl , but i hear none of these defects . my set is revealing , and it reveals excellent engineering , considering the largeish ensemble mr. batt has assembeled . fear not , unless the cd really is badly made
0	this album is n't not very good at all . there are about four songs i like . first off , the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats . then , the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically . then , there are no new verses from biggie , on the album . they should have stopped with born again , because album will be a forgotten one , not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls
0	this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now , but i 'm just not feeling it . the single `` wolf like me '' is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album . it is a great song , but everything else is just blah . i think the band could use a different singer , the guy they got does n't sing very well or very `` soulful '' . the music is good , very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet . i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy . do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews . just listen to the cd before you buy it . that 's my advice
1	first of all i 'm a die hard ufo fan , i own every ufo album not just the michael shenker cd 's ... some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1 ) do the band a disservice 2 ) are smokin crack , and 3 ) are very inept in your musical judgement . while i 'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god , and i hate to break the news to ya 's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song . that bein said making contact is one of the top five ufo albums made ! ! ! ! the top five ufo albums any fan should get are ( phenomenon , lights out , no place to run , making contact , and walk on water ) along with the two live cd 's bbc , and strangers in the night . misdemeaner has some cool 80 's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream ( and they deserve to be mainstream ) so who can blame them , and some of these songs are pretty cool ... if , i might add if you have an open mind ( so that excludes most of you shenker diehards ) ... ... ... ..
1	i just bought this on cd as it was on sale through the cd club . i have the original vinyl , but had n't listened to it in years . this is one of the best works of music ever conceived , written and performed . it is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last . put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times . it just keeps getting better . stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best . do n't forget how great music was in the 70 's . this work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70 's music today by artists that were n't even born then . you can see quite clearly the artists that followed stevie . most recently alicia keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration
1	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended . being that i never heard all of her albums , so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin ' . however for me , who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me . some of the tracks i love , a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like . my favorite ones are in order ; erotica ray of light beautiful stranger the power of goodbye deeper and deeper the prodution is excellent and i love the vocals . if your new to madonna , my opinion would be to start here . but a true fan can give me lessons .
1	too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on cds like this . john rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting . the music overwhelms the senses and the joy of christmas overcomes you as you listen . this is one of the most peaceful christmas cds i have ever heard . `` wassail song '' is incredible , and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble , this song is a must to perform . you will not be disappointed when you purchase this cd
0	i expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd , i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked , besides that this album is garbag
1	unless you frequented jazz clubs in baltimore or philly in the fall of 1955 , this would have been your first exposure to the miles davis-john coltrane collaboration ( a few tracks recorded for columbia , the label miles would soon be joining exclusively , a few weeks before this session were n't issued until much later ) . davis settled on coltrane as his replacement for the departing sonny rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book . that they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much ( davis was a hands-off leader , coltrane wanted constant input from miles on his playing and music in general ) . stablemates ( a benny golson tune ) is the track that seems to draw the most attention . it 's an excellent composition , and although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative ( nervous ? ) , the performance is attractive . but my favorite side is there is no greater love , even though coltrane sits this one out : miles plays beautifully , and i love the emotion he wrings from the tune . true , this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz , but it 's a very good session nonetheless . the group plays well , the rhythm section is rock solid , and they are all off and running . full speed ahead
0	i received a cd , the tango cd ( the best tango album in the world ever ) was defectuous , since it plays alright until the 12th song , but then the songs starts giving weird tones . and the 2nd cd acts the same way , since my tango album is a double cd.the problem is not from the radio , since my other purchase from amazon is in good shape , as al my other cds . the music always stops playing right at the same time of the cd , the 12 th song , so its pretty much a cd problem . i dunno whats the refund policy , or customer service number , its so bad , cos this tango cd is great . i enjoyed it much , until ... ... ... th
0	first they started out as nu-metal , then they moved onto metalcore , and now psuedo-death metal . it should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends , and after each trend dies , they just move on to another one . if my calculations are correct , expect a psuedo-black metal release . but , what about the musicians ? sure , they have a fast drummer ... who likes to trigger alot , then they have two guitarists ... who like to steal pantera riffs , and then they have the singer , who , well , sounds just like all the rest . atleast they dont have the dj anymore ( oh wait , they do , nevermind . ) enough of my rambling , how does this untalented group of posers fair up ? well , image if mushroomhead went metalcore . 'nuff said . avoid
0	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today , this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 . right before female rappers ( there 's a few exceptions ) , i hate all little kid rappers . even when i was a kid . i do n't like anything on this album , i still got the tape and it has n't `` krossed '' my mind to even cop the cd . if you like this kind of stuff , or you loved `` jump '' back in the day then i guess this is for you
1	hard , smart , creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days . even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us , finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch . thankfully , `` secrets , '' under the usually readily available columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $ 9.99 . should this be a hard decision ? emphatically : no . although i can see where previous reviewers are coming from , trying to compare this outing to headhunters is truly unnecessary . with this '76 effort herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz , funk and disco but it all works . `` doin it '' is a super , super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the `` man-child '' sessions . and although `` gentle thoughts '' can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album . it 's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and , as always , herbie dancing on the keys . go get `` secrets , '' do n't think about it . it 'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion
1	about the band : dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre . in fact , the name of the label , 4ad , which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments . brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra . lisa gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa . i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . about the album : compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again . i count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd . one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa 's and brendan 's ghostly vocals . on some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals . simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to . i honestly give this album my highest recommendations ! two tracks i 'd recommend sampling : `` towards the within '' ( featuring lisa 's vox w/ brendan backing ) and `` tell me about the forest '' ( featuring brendan 's vox ) . i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album . please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes . similar artists : chances are if you are n't yet familiar with dead can dance , that you 've not yet discovered some of these other bands , but i highly recommend them as well : das zeichen , impressions of winter , love is colder than death , qntal , corvus corax , or helium vola . there is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance . please check some of them out as well .
0	this album made me realize that darn record company produces , for examle , two regular albums ; two best albums ; two tribute albums ; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums from a musician . this is an example of the mixture of previously released , re-released , at last , over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular album title . let me tell you one thing . jp is dead and gone since rob left the band . i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you 'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying
0	i find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented d.j . to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar ; ripping off the kids droned and purged on the mtv feedbag , and this man paul wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them . notice his rhymes do n't descend any futher than his mouth , his car and his money . what excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me ? does it reach artistic heights ? or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame ? and still people eat it up like chicken n dumplin 's on a cold winter 's day this is excactly whats very wrong with today 's hip hop , it 's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely stay away from this awful garbage do n't let mtv rob another cen

1	gun 's roses came out in the nick of time . record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same . g made their debut on the music scene in 87 but did n't get big until almost late 88 early 89 . appitite is a true masterpiece . welcome to the jungle , it 's so easy , mr. brownstone , my michelle ... .the list goes on and on . put it in turn it up to 10 and rock on ! the they made a mistake . they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums . so instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums . then they vanished . anyone who is a fan of the music but could n't care less about axl should pick up velvet revolver with slash and scott wieland from stone temple pilots
0	after reading so many positive reviews , i was very exited when i recieved this cd in the mail . i popped it in my bose wave radio , turned it up to 85 , and listened to the most annoying hissing sound i 've ever heard coming from my system . i regret purchasing this cd
1	as a former piano major i can assure those who would purchase this dusc that it is well worth it . reminiscent ( dare i say it ? ) of horowitz
0	a friend who knows my taste in music recommended vnv nation to me , so i got matter + form based on the reviews . in one sense i like it . the production is excellent and i find every track to be creative and unique . but i hate the vocals and so i ca n't bear to listen to the cd . this dude has the worst voice in music history .
0	this cd is 100 % pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high-pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show . the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive , either . if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better . stop this s****y music !
0	this was the worst thing i 've ever heard , except maybe clap your hands say yeah . my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever
1	it 's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now . i think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday . but it did n't . it came out in the summer of 1979 . it was the summer before my sophomore year in college , my first summer away from home . for at least a week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 1 of `` rust never sleeps . '' it took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over . and then , when i did , for the next week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 2 of `` rust never sleeps . '' my flatmates never complained . oddly , the songs i see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves . you do n't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar , contagious handclaps , and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of `` welfare mothers , '' now , do you really ? as for `` sedan delivery , '' i have only the vaguest clue of what it 's about , but it 's sure a scorcher ( and it 's still hard to find a job ) . allright , maybe we do n't need two versions of `` hey hey , my my , '' but which one would you delete ? as far as i 'm concerned , there 's only one song here that has n't withstood the test of time : `` sail away , '' which is innocuously pretty , but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff . `` trasher '' and `` pocahontas '' are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places . poor marlon , poor csn . do i wax nostalgiac ? perhaps , but not overly so . this remains essential neil , which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets . it still sounds fresh and relevant . and fun . did i mention fun ? in fact , i 'm gon na go plunk it on right now , maybe take a breather between `` sail away '' and `` powderfinger '' to relive the lp experience . you should too .
1	i get the sense that the fleetwoods'body of recorded work is n't given the respect it deserves . over the course of their career , the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection , as good as it is , is pretty much all that 's out there on cd , save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground . rock and roll has always had a soft side and it 's in this area that the fleetwoods really shine . their cover of thomas wayne 's `` tragedy '' is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-i ca n't put it any other way . maybe that 's the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today : they 're the perfect embodiment of a ( then ) nascent teen culture 's soft and gentle side.this collection features all of their hits , some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of `` come softly to me '' . if you like this recording , try looking for their original lps . ( my personal favourite is the 1963 `` goodnight my love '' album .
1	i never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some do n't . well , willie was one of those that definately did . it is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of willie dixon : the writer , the musician , the producer , the businessman . i listen to his work over and over again , each time learning new nuances i did not hear before . how incredible is that
0	wow guys ... how many of you are on crack ? ive given this album 2 whole listens an it still sucks ass . besides if i should have to listen to something more than a few times to know its hot then its wack . cause if you listen to anything enough you will like it . it 's human nature ... keith , ummm ... excuse me `` dr. octagon `` is a retard , mentalcase , and has no lyrical ability . half of you people like this just cause its so different . what he says makes no sence , and has no meaning . that which he does say that does make sence is nasty , and weak . his flow is awefull . his delivery is awefulll . automator does a good job on the boards making nice beats , but keiths lame ass f***s up good beats ... feel free to click that you dont agree with this kool keith d***riders . :

0	i opend the cd filled with joy till it started ; at the beginning i thought there should be some kind of mistake but no , there were no letters . not even one word , we could n't sing at all ; we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing
0	anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies . seriously
0	remember the days when we were punks and we 'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders ? they held up to 4 minutes of music ! count 'em , 4 minutes ! then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him , including myself . he was quite the singer . when i was a young kid though , the only form of music we had were the concerts . i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert , quite an amazing virtuoso , and johann strauss jr. conducting his orchestra , those were the days . then they came out with those things called grammophones , which were even more modern , if it was even possible . but it was , because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to , lazy kids . i mean , you did n't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones . and what 's this , 1 hour , a full 60 minutes of music , on 1 record ? pshaw ! 4 minutes of music was all i needed , and i was still pooped out even after that . in my day , it was bed at 4 p.m. , breakfast at 2 a.m. , then off to the mines . we did n't have 60 minutes of free time . i have no idea what form of music they have now . appearently , they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph . now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods ( ? ) and mp3 , mp4 players , whatever they 're called , listening to that `` hip-hop '' tomfoolery of theirs . you ca n't even call it music , it 's just noise . well , got ta get ready for bed now , it 's almost 3:45
0	this collection is a must have if you like the bee gees and do n't have any of their albums ... or even if you do . it 's one hit after another plus some i 've never heard , which is nice for variety . i could n't ask for a better collection - it 's like i had burned this for myself .
0	i do n't want to hear any more of their music on the radio . it is all just nonsense , and none of it should have ever been made . they are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory
1	being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals , i must say i rate this as `` one of the best '' . the dancers are fantastic ! the music utterly great , the choice of dances ( from classical to rock ) is highly deversified . ca n't wait till i get it so i can play it again and again . as well as `` rock the house , shake my bootie , etc
0	look , as music goes , variations on a theme is part of any genre . this album , however , yells out `` leave well enough alone . '' a remix of sgt.peppers lhcb might thrill a person born in 1986 , but when you hear the real thing , you ask why change it ? this album is a total waste of a truly great disc . like gipeto said to pinocchio , `` stay wood !
0	crikey ! ! ! ! what is this chunder ? wait a minute ... .art students from `` down under '' get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of `` the wiggles '' , decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base ! yeah , this stuff could be the soundtrack to `` forrest gump '' alright . `` run , forrest , run ! run as fast as you can from this crap ! ! ! '' and these guys are touring , too ? are they touring with barney friends ? there is not one thing of value to this other than that the cd itself makes a handy coaster for your foster's..
1	every thing he sings is perfect , i 've yet to find one song that does n't move me . this cd has some beauties . `` daughter of mine '' is priceless . `` steal away '' is very nice . `` one small star '' brings tears . this arrangement of `` voyage '' is probably the best i 've heard . his traditional songs ( `` when you and i were young maggie '' and `` mary of argyle '' ) are beautiful . i ca n't find anything on this cd i could n't listen to for hours . i truly love music and listen to it constantly . i find myself reaching for the mcdermott cd 's almost exclusively . i have them all , more please
0	as a 21 year old , i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack . but , i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies . imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney 's parts were not sung by rosemary clooney ! i do not recommend buying this album . enjoy the music when you watch the movies , instead . trust me , it 's better that way
1	i remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as lloyd dobler . this soundtrack is also one of those things . this album for me , as for many i 'm sure , somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time , and even now actually . of course the biggie here is `` in your eyes '' from peter gabriel . who has n't that track touched at some point ? this also confirmed my love for the red hot chili peppers , and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic `` taste the pain '' . toss on a few from fishbone , living colour , and the replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80 's alt-rock lover . not to mention the goods from depeche mode and nancy wilson ( heart ) . in fact the only thing that could 've made this album any better , is if it ended with a `` ding ''
0	yes , she has a great voice , but this entire cd is so overproduced , so lifeless , so very boring that i had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice . she sounds as bored as i was on every song . i hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
1	this album came out about 8 years before i was born . all the years , i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean . now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album . this is mj in his prime . unfortunately , we will never get another epic like this again . michael is sadly a target in the media , but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not . every song off here is a classic . one song i thought was unneccesary was `` baby be mine '' . but otherwise , it 's excellent . if you starting an mj collection , get this album first . trust me .
1	a truly glorious recording , just what i want in music , with brilliancy , sensitivity , and beauty . this is a must have for every music lover worth the name
0	this disc was simply a waste of my time ... very mediocre songs , heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent ... corey 's voice is below average ... .i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career , and not doing it very well ... .clearly 'fake it till you make it ' is n't working here . the songs all sound the same , i kept waiting for something to get me grooving , but it just did n't happen . i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential ... he either needs voice lessons , a little humility , and some professional grooming ( and i do n't mean clothing ) .
0	i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s . unfortunately , instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music , what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated , with some latin tones now and then . the only semi retro/electro tracks on here ( and my favorites ) are feel for you , love bite , your love is like a drug , and marc almond 's remix of venus . the two lead singles `` move in my direction '' and `` look on the floor '' are not even the strongest tracks ! and the remixes on their singles do n't make them much better . i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken , but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this . take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne ( ! ) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that do n't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just do n't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc . but of course , fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection . it 's listenable , if not up to today 's standards
1	this is the album that all kenny g fans have been waiting for ! ! ! it was well worth the wait too . not only is kenny g at the top of his game but the vocalists are great ! the entire group of artists is so eclectic . thank you kenny g ! !
1	i , like many others , have been waiting for this album for quite some time . right from the first track , i was hooked . `` all my days '' is a haunting , melodic , heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album . `` breathe '' has a subdued yet powerful message . `` home '' is just plain fun . `` song for you '' is sweet , somber , and hopeful . however , i must say that the four songs version of `` orange sky '' is what i consider to be the greatest song ever written . however , the time without consequence version is devastatingly bad ( when held up to the light of the original ) . the new version is too fast , has an inexplicably irritating percussion , and just does n't dig into the soul the way the four songs version does . i will always be baffled by this remake . it is truly awful . its only saving grace is that the original is still available . but that is by no means any reason to avoid this cd . in fact , those who do not know the original `` orange sky '' may fall in love with this one . but it is my duty to warn those looking for an `` orange sky '' that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed . outside of this single-song complaint , this cd has vaulted to one of the best i own
1	without a doubt , this is a must-have for any fan of the go-betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band . `` a man far wiser than myself once referred to `` 16 lovers lane '' as 'the indie rumours ' '' the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the go-betweens ultimate set of songs . no truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set . why this album did n't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved . but needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-release for those of you unfamiliar with the go-betweens work , this was the consummate work of their 80 's heyday , for a great many reasons . the music is bright pop music , crystal clear , but in no way is it featherweight pop . the songs are beautifully arranged , every instrument , vocal , handclap , and anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place , but this can be said of nearly every go-betweens release . the lyrics , plaintive ruminations on love , are clearly written by two songwriters/lyricists going through the opposite sides of relationships . i will not go into detail here as the liner notes tell the story , but the interplay within the band as these relationships play out are what drove the entire release . each lyricist , grant mclennan and robert forster , gets about half of the album 's lyrics , and that is what makes the cd special . images of the giddyness of new love ( `` love goes on ! '' ) are juxtaposed with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking . `` i 'm ten feet under water/standing in a sunken canoe/looking up at the water lillies/they 're green and violet blue/still the sun it finds/a place to light me '' from `` love is a sign '' has to be one of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship falls apart that has ever been placed in song . these themes are repeatedly dealt with in different ways , from young lovers meeting and breaking up to the `` old '' love of couples with children ( `` you ca n't say no forever '' ) having a fight . the bonus material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome . the videos to `` streets of your town '' ( still undoubtedly the best song on this incredible collection ) and `` was there anything i could do ? '' underscore the relationships going on in the band while not seeming too terribly out of date . the bonus disc of outtakes and b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes several songs that did n't make the final album cut but are presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions , being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo . the real treat come with the acoustic `` demos '' that are included . `` you wo n't find it again , '' `` apples in bed , '' and `` head over heels '' are played only by mclennan and forster on acoustic guitars , providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere . to top it all off , the packaging ( including an awesome essay by british songwriter andrew male ) is exquisite , providing detail on the circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent recording information . this is `` 16 lovers lane '' as it was meant to be heard -- enjoy !
1	este cd es excelente ! se los recomiendo a todos los que les guste la musica buena . robi es un gran poeta y filosofo
0	looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) . which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( `` life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness '' ) or precious ( `` suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound '' ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds . we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
0	i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack ... they are horrible pieces of s $ # ! ? * % # ! # $ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put `` low rider '' on the soundtrack , how cheap is that
0	i 'm surprised this show got past season 1 . honestly , more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar . this show does not discover talent , they produce and market it . it is really demeaning to musicians everywhere . the judges are a joke , i guess the producers tell them what to say . simon `` the jerk '' cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone , hey ... he has made a living out of it . randy jackson 's vocab is limited to `` yo '' , `` yeah '' and `` dawg '' . paula , who 's the only one who i think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone , be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/ ( fill with any word of your choice ) . all in all , a total disaster ... only in shows this sh*tty , can no-talents like william hung be hailed as a celebrity . i am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers . on a more positive note , it 's good that people do n't actually buy the albums , thus resulting in total disappearing acts from idol winners like ruben and fantasia ... now we just need the american public to stop tuning in to the shows . well , hope is all we have , right
0	despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release , i need to be honest and explain why i am giving just one poor star . no , i am not crazy . let me explain my point-of-view , and after that you can decide if this jh album really deserves more stars . just to start , this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band ( ? ) or the musicians thru a solid path . there are tracks played by a duo , trio , 4tt , and sometimes a very loose quintet , and each of these tracks have a different mood , without any presence of a jazz soul , or even a real smell of jazz . maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to mr strayhorn , or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever . but the result was very poor . if you really love joe henderson ( as i appreciate ) , try any of his albums from the 60 's ( as a band-leader or as a sideman ) , mainly those from the blue note era . in time : i gave one star , in memory of his brilliant carreer . this particular album deserve zero-star .
0	when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony , one can only be disappointed in diva destruction 's music . the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut
0	except for the song , mother mother , i did n't really care for the rest of the cd . i bought it for mother , mother so i guess i got what i wanted . i had hoped to like other songs as well , but , oh well
1	i picked this up in a bootleg store in korea a few years back , since it was cheap , and i had loved the movie ( perhaps more so than any other of mallicks 's others , even - speaking of which , if you get a chance to see badlands on the big screen , do yourself a huge favour and do so ) . as i recall , i did n't really enjoy it on first listen . but then , somehow , i got sucked in . almost as much as the film itself , this is a hypnotic , haunting slice of poetry . nothing happens for about a minute , and then it builds and builds . unforgettable , otherwordly and quite beguiling . the structure of the soundtrack ( especially the songs toward the end featuring polynesian gospel-style singing ) is strongly reminiscent of the mike oldfield cd , 'songs of distant earth ' . highly recommended , but do give it a couple of listens , because it might take a while to make its charms felt
0	this is nothing compared to their ep , which was great by the way . songs lack of inventive , arrangements and feeling ... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued , but no more
1	this guy is a freak of nature ! different but in the same vein as illinoise . i loved it..no fillers to speak of . if you liked some of the more laid back songs on illinoise ! , you 'll love this album . its great regardless . highlights are : avalanche adlai stevenson saul bellow the mistress witch from mcclure springfiel , or bobby got a shadfly caught in his hair no man 's land the perpetual self , or `` what would saul alinsky do ? s
1	i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out , and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention . shoegazers ? ? ? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces . its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger . just buy it ... and all the rest
1	i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now . imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available . surprise turned to shock when i saw the price . does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world ( including south africa where i live ) who are very keen on this album ? at this stage though , it is only the very wealthy that can afford it .
1	listen , did i hear someone say `` lack of energy ? '' get this album , as my lovely wife did for me last christmas , from amazon , btw , and listen to this lineup : fire water , mr. big , i 'm a mover , woman , all right now , oh i wept , stealer , walk in my shadow ... oh , get up off the floor , amigo ... see , it 's you that 's having a lack of energy ... i know , this music is like a workout , emotionally , aurally , and in the old pleasure zone too . rodgers the late great paul kossoff surely knew how to sell a song , did n't they ? perhaps these fellows were near the best , not only at the time , but in any century of rock/blues/git-down-kick in-the-mud blooz music . yowzah
1	wow ! there 's sooooo ... much to like in this album it 's amazing . the music is mostly upbeat very catchy -- making you want to ( will if no one 's around ) sing along . the lyrics are fine , meaningful , personally touching -- about life which is getting faster faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , all the rest of what makes people human . the lead singer , jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . she grabs you quickly for a wild ride -- immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl something more ( on the tv show vegas of all place ) . then i heard sugarland on the cma show -- winning awards as they so deserve . the range variety of the songs on the album are good too -- from sweet poignant ballads to wild spicy soaring . virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to the majority could become successful singles . yes , the style is their own mixture of influences -- the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . and , the trio wrote all the songs on the cd -- with hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . how many trios are there with 2 women 1 man ? i wonder if they are unique ? well , they are unique even if not in that respect -- how many bands include a mandolin ? . of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners are . this has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . imho , it 's terrific
0	when mike the mechanics ushered in the `madchester ' scene with the living years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon . if you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads ! verdict : do n't waste your money .
1	hey there all , want to listen to some great songs by a country artist , chely wright , then go ahead and purchase this cd you will be amazed at the talent chely has . songs spanning from her ealier days to her current hits , a great collection for the diehard fan , and a great gift for those who have not been able to experience the very talented chely wright
0	come on . i can not play these dual discs in my car nor any regular cd players . j are excellent though
0	i think ms hewitt misses the mark , yes for an actress turned singer she 's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer ... would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal ? i think not ... same goes for the other latin jennifer..
1	stick to singing in spanish , shak
0	maybe her harp playing could be acceptable , but when she sings ... everything turns awful . the worst singer i ever heard
1	several tunes on 'back to oakland ' feature tower of power at their best . one in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track , 'squib cakes ' . featured soloists include a short , mellow guitar solo from bruce conte , followed by greg adams ' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range ( leading one to believe it 's a trombone ! ) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish . tenor madness abounds from lead saxman lenny pickett ( known primarily for his work as lead tenor for the saturday night live band ) , wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range ( jazz musicians call these 'freak notes ' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ) , while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout . chester thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in la in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer . lyrical yet hard-driving , thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'squib cakes ' , then takes off on his own flight , delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though bach suddenly had learned some jazz hammond himself . in the middle of the solo , as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove , thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand , chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left , that in the days of hearing this on vinyl , i wondered if my record was skipping through that section ! to finish the groove , at the end of thompson 's solo , the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets . after he closes , we 're back to the head to close out the tune . even with so much to savor , this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more , even after the final stroke of the last chord . the musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album 's other tunes . i have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time i spin it . i recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore tower of power 's `` sound . '' - kathryn shut
1	david foster , who wrote a few tunes on yes 's `` time and a word '' is here on bass with tony kaye on the b3 and it 's the performance of their lives captured live at the rainbow . a brave but good way to record a debut album , album was produced by jon anderson and the cover drawn by roger dean , just like yes . it gives you feeling that tony left yes on good terms when rick wakeman stepped in
0	i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters . given his status/reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about . having had no preconceptions , i have to say i was quite disappointed . i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable . perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best . specific example that speaks volumes : listen to cohen 's singing of his `` hallelujah '' and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on `` grace '' which was recorded in 1994 . sorry , leonard , you can not hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song . it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy . `` tant pis , vers le bonheur .
0	i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called `` mastering '' . i have original un-mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set ! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go , but in all honesty , this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality . the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for . i can not recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close . save your money and wait
1	sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre . it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting . its not what you would really consider to be a `` religious '' album but there are many undertones that help get the message across . this point being made very clear in `` museum of iscariot '' which talks of jesus from judas ' point of view . rowan 's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album , from low opera type to screaming , in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old . if you are into relaxed darkwave/goth music this is a perfect album to purchase
0	sorry , bill ! poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase . the guitar playing is adequate , but not good enough to save this material . i hope bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material .
1	king elvis . queen madiona . prince justin . and now princess hillary ! duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop . it was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all christmas classics with some other pop stars too . if you love hillary duff and you really need some new cd 's by her and it 's crhistmas time then this is cd for you ! let me tell ya somethin ' , that girl can sing . so go to the cd store . buy it ! play it ! plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog .
0	i purchased `` empty '' not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable , but eventually forgettable , pop/rock . this sophomore effort is , simply put , amatuer and sub-par . some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as `` empty '' b-sides , while the cover of `` electric avenue '' never really distracts most listeners from thinking `` what is this and why ? '' over all , this might appeal to most christian radio listeners , but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is : mold-fitting white noise
1	a true musical genius . take a blow get a zyr voduski and snapple lemonade and let the music cover you up . powerplus from the 70 's and 80 's . tight lyrics and pop masterpiece arangements . go todd go
0	`` maiden voyage '' appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces , and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward . nevertheless , the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing . to these ears , this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying . the songs meander without clear structure and tony williams ' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band . the influence of this album is indisputable , but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter . if you enjoy groundbreaking , cerebral jazz such as the music made by miles davis ' second quintet , then this album will probably work for you . if , on the other hand , you favor hancock 's earlier and more accessible albums `` takin ' off '' and `` my point of view , '' this album may be a bit of a letdown
0	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs , girls , cars and jewelery . i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album . the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset . lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat . save your money
1	a top quality recording with all of artie shaw 's favorites . artie 's music as fresh today as when it was recorded - with the power and appeal that hits you right between the eyes
1	blue note was on the mark to re-release this classic . tina brook 's style of blues laced jazz is a sound that will bring joy to your soul . a must have cd for any jazz collection
0	to those of you interested in this cd in lieu of finding the `` songs with lyrics '' in the movie ice age , got bad news for you . they are not here ! i really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they do n't include the best or features songs in the movie . anyway , the song that pretty much everyone wants when manny , sid , diego and the baby are together and walking towards half peak is called `` send me on my way '' by rusted root . it is on their latest album `` when i woke '' . put rusted root in the amazon search engine and you should find it . hope this helps those looking for this song
0	i 've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist . my wife and i got a couple of her disc 's , plus that `` very best of '' cd and was really looking forward to her latest , but this one ... zzzzzzzz , makes me wonder what they 're putting in sheryl 's coffee . some reviewers are saying there 's `` heart and soul '' all over this album ? that may be , but it 's also very slick dullsville stuff too . as for the album cover graphics , i do n't see the roger dean yes covers or the 60 's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote , but a very `` modern '' graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using . kelly clarkson , the vines , the donnas , the list goes on . highlights : good is good ( i guess it 's time for a new `` very best of '' collection )
1	i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad . all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating . it 's like the first beatles anthology set : the material is amazing but the quality is bad . on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise . the packaging is also very nice . i just though i 'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set . if you are a stooges fan do n't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait .
1	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar . nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues . he was and is a great rocker , but his true calling is as a bluesman . this is a great album
0	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans , but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here . robin frequently disappears in the sound mix , becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony . that 's fine for a group concert , like the bee gees , but inexcusable for a solo effort . his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act . they should have kept this in the can . it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin . do n't do him the favor
0	i bought this cd for one song , `` walk away '' which was one of their best known songs . i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems . there was n't . the rest of the album is like an anti-climax . i would suggest a greatest hits instead . if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
1	purchased this album because of the great album cover , was i surprised when i popped it into my cd player . i had n't heard of rick braun before but after listening to this cd , i ran out and purchased everything he has ever recorded . never have i heard a trumpet sound so beautiful . share this music with someone you love
0	a mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s . do n't even bother ...
0	one good song , of course `` the sound of silence '' , and the studio version is far better than this one . i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect
1	now i know what you 're thinking , why are there two releases of `` xx '' ? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re-released the album `` xx '' but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals ( big mistake ! ) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 . if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !
1	it was my full belief that the next time we would hear from buju banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `rasta got soul ' album . the album which has still yet to arrive ( and may never ) was said to be along buju 's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `til shiloh . he even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album 's first single , the `magical ' magic city . so the world was waiting to see just how much soul the album had . however . between then and now buju has been going through so many events that this album , too bad , almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics . forever , it seems that he is still living in the `boom bye bye curse ' , and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling , he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is too bad . the album has a severe kick to it , it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate ' assassin 's infiltrate from `05 , in terms of style . the attraction here is actually the subject of `confusion ' . while we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe , buju has n't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time . thus , the dj who was once the dancehall 's main attraction stepping back into the fray is n't at all a bad thing . so fans who sit longing for the days of stamina daddy and batty rider are the one 's who 'll be happy and i can fit into that camp as well ! but at the same time , buju 's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots , so now it is there where he will ultimately excel . however , with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims , you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again . the best tune here is probably the hard hard `til it bend . til it bend is serious serious rudey dancehall . the song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear , but i guarantee that is the song most jamaican will pull up , til it bend is nice ! also check the wicked wicked nothing , who have it ? , the ultra clever better day and the nice hey boy over the petty thief riddim . however , my second favorite song here i would have to say would be the combination don dupes with underrated dancehall singer pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently , largely due to his connection with madhouse head , dave kelly . buju makes an attempt ( for some reason ) at the useless wipeout riddim on me unu and actually makes it work a little . also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as driver , which is easily one of the best tunes on the album . overall , the thought alone , buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is , this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans . while there is nothing here that i would call definitive roots reggae , this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of buju 's will find something they like . i would have like to have seen buju have at least one lenky riddim on the album , a wayne wonder combination ( although pinchers subs just fine ) and definitely the massive song beauty queen from the twice again riddim would have fit just fine here , but nevertheless , what you do have : high quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and too bad , over both what beenie and baby cham have done , is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date , and a boomshot in the arm for the genre
1	buy it . now . stop reading . are you still reading ? ? ? ? okay , so i 'll tell you my reason why . reason ( s ) why . 5.1 sound . dts . different ( some versions better to my ears/psyche ) than the cd . flavor . beautiful production . did i mention dts - you got ta hear this in dts . and she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her ( gratuitously inciting flaming ) . i am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have dvd 's covering her 'girl in the other room ' and her 'from this moment on ' .
1	this cd is great . it is a must have . picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly . you hear the rain , the thunder in the distance , you sense the storm getting closer . the storm is over head , loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover . the thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents . the thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in , bullfrogs , owls in the distance , all the animals are alive now . this cd is all in one , the real deal . it is not all thunder . i love it . i also bought thunderstorm [ rykodisc ] ; this was a waste of money . to me , in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out , static and more static .
0	i woke up this morning to the grating sounds of `` good little girls '' blaring over my clock radio 's single , worn-out speaker . a speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year , such as `` there goes my life '' and `` live like you were dying '' . `` good little girls '' is easily the worst country song i 've ever heard - and i thought neal mccoy was bad ! blue country is the c equivalent of wham ! ( a dated reference to be sure ) maybe i 'm just getting too old for country music
0	i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd , demon days . the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so `` out there '' that when you first hear one of their cd 's ... it sounds like complete garbage . but once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . eventually you end up really liking the cd . that was the case with demon days . after enjoying that cd fully , i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd , and i did n't like it all that much . there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd . way too much of it sounds like complete filler . there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days , but most of the stuff on that cd was great . here , we 've got songs that are just ... boring . nothing happens . i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( such as on songs like new genious , man research , and starshine . ) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all , sometimes sounding just like static noise . songs like this , such as double bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . it gets boring . other songs , like 5/4 , m1 a1 , and rock the house are catchy at first , but just do n't have staying power . they get old . 5/4 got annoying quickly , m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly , and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . and songs like latin simone are just annoying . the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable , although 19-2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . there are some good songs here , though . tomorrow comes today , clint eastwood , gravity , 19-2000 , and left hand suzuki method are cool songs . slow country 's kind of cool , too . and dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . this small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . much of this cd just is n't really that good . i do n't know ... this cd just seemed empty . very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes ( ! ) longer than demon days ) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff . people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up , demon days , instead of this one . if i listened to this debut cd first , i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much . the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump ; their cds are getting better , not worse . that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band .
1	i 've always been a terri clark fan but this is the first cd i 've purchased by her . i was surprised at how much i really enjoyed this cd ! terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again
1	i 'm a fan of three 6 mafia , and i can say maybe they kinda got a little of three 6 's rap style in this album , but i dunno . dj paul and juicy j , the superproducers , they can never be beaten . i got all the hypnotize minds albums and they did invent crunk music . many people have n't heard of them cuz besides ridin ' spinners and chickenhead they have n't been played on the radio very much except for their new track `` poppin ' my collar . '' crime mob 's alright . the beats are alright , but nothing compared to three 6 mafia . some of them are some krunk songs , i can get hyped to a few of them . but other than that i dunno . the lyrics are rather simple , i 'm an 18 year old white dude and i think i can put together some better bars than these dudes can . but they do get some major play up here in virginia . stilletos and knuck if you buck have n't gotten some airtime . but there 's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing . i guess we 'll see if they put out another album or not . i think if they had some other fellas from georgia like t.i . or jeezy or something they might get some more hype . who knows , since paul wall 's on every song now maybe he 'll make a cameo . i guess we 'll see . three 6 mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist chrome , who really is garbage , they are still the kings of crunk , not lil ' john
1	i do n't own this cd . i do n't have to own it to review it , because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years . i lived this music . i listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities . half of the bands on this cd i had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s . this is what fm radio sounded like back then . every single song on this cd was well known to me and my friends . yes , even black oak arkansas ( hot and nasty ! ) , nazareth ( get hair of the dog cd for more ) , and the runaways ( hot babes ! ) . oh , and i love the movie too . party on , dudes
0	i have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band . all of their records , in general , sound exactly the same , and this one is no exception . post-velvets guitar/organ drones , lackadaisical vocals , blankly uninteresting non-lyrics ( they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting ) , and a dramatic lack of energy ; all of yo la tengo 's trademarks are fully represented here , and if you can stay awake through it , you 're a better man/woman than i . a surpassingly boring record , even from this usually very boring band . if you 've heard the velvet underground , neu ! , stereolab 's early records , and sonic youth , you 've heard yo la tengo in total . if you 're a big enough fan of those named bands , you could probably write songs that sound like `` painful . '' but you would probably write better ones . avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia
1	this album is incredible . for me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life . an album that for months i played over and over . an album that i 've played countless times , that i have passed out to when i came home after a late night , that i have ran to , and worked out to , that i play at work for a pick-me up . it 's great . it 's filled with so much emotion and passion , from beginning to end its just brilliant , the entire album . the songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams . i love it . you have to buy this album . then buy their next self titled album . then play it and play it , and play it . it grows on you . i ca n't wait to see them live ...
1	sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with guaraldi 's 1960 's hit `` cast your fate to the wind . '' throw in a coupla classics like `` since i fell for you '' and `` moon river '' masterfully interpreted by vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding , loving , or waking up
1	when i bought this cd it was for a little bit of nostalgia - those were the days . since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories , i have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now . if you liked mary hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
1	this was one of the first hiphop albums i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that krs 's style was best suited to primos production . once he lost primo ( with the exception of a few albums ) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly . krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack mcs that deserved it . this was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into hiphop this was the era that i belive hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper .
0	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical . a better alternative would be to listen to either : a ) the original artists who influenced this band or b ) someone at least trying to do something new with music . to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band , either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super-cool reputation . if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry , you 're not .
0	this album contains only rap and no rock songs . this was very disappointing to say the least
1	dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today . threading the thin line between commercial and underground , and finding his niche somewhere in between ( as unkle says , the middle ground between light and shadow ) dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth . i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release , and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing , which is by far dj shadow 's best album , and one of the best albums ever made . by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value , and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music . i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is ; a work of art , and a continual growing of shadow 's talents . had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i 'm sure i would have garnered it with a 4 star review , but that is simply not the case here . while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album , josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album , and given us an album that i 'm sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time . best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home ( possibly with a little mary in tow , if you know what i mean ) , the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows , and the beats are flawless , especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis . see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels , and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve . radiohead for example has a way of doing this , and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead , they both fuse these elements into their music , and achieve monumental status in my opinion . the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation , and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package . if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works : endtroducing , preemptive strike , the private press , and in tune and on time , which is a live set recorded in support of this album . unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop , rock and techno , with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys , thom yorke from radiohead , and others from throughout the music industry . if you 've never heard of dj shadow before , then i must say that you are missing out , if you are at all interested in underground music , do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow 's albums or collaborations , i guarantee you will extremely impressed , as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time . peace out
1	yes , there may be some small issues with the sound quality , but you get used to it , and wilhelm kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th century , so it is worth it . these are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive . kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity , whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes . highly recommended
0	hooba ... stank ... stinks and will always stink . i do n't know about the rest of the cd , but listening to the reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal . i 'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn . egad
0	can this be the same d-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner ? well , i guess this really does prove they are only a side-show . eminem has different production , so the group will have different production . eminem went more serious , now the group is more serious . besides that , shady himself ( or what is left of what he use to be ) is basically a no-show . in any track eminem 's in , it 's usually the strongest , and that is the case here ; however , that does n't mean he was great . that means the cd itself is misconfusion , contradiction , and a side-show for eminem 's next cd ( `` encore '' , which was better then this , but not that great overall , as well ) . d-12 is the commercials to the eminem show , everyone 's just waiting to get in between them . that 's the case here
0	this cd has some good songs on it , but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected . they are mixed together , and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs , buy this , but i would n't recommend it otherwise
0	this cd and the one entitled '' night ranger 's greatest hits are almost identical , but are different in this way : `` best '' contains `` i did it for love '' . `` greatest '' contains , instead , `` rumours in the air '' and `` restless kind '' . the other 10 tracks on each cd are the same . so , which one to buy ? my choice is the one with the extra track . also , in my opinion , both tracks on `` greatest '' are better than the one on `` best '' . in addition , here 's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true `` greatest hits '' or `` best of '' album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs . or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks . night ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that
0	i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody ( name changed due to copyright issues ) on their 2006 live album live in canada . i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort . the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music . the vocals tend to be oversung , or drowned out by the chaos in the background . rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements , rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them . the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
1	i agree with everyone else ; the music on this album is completely magical . two masters at work with a great rhythm section , very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies , unbounded joy in every tune , and some interesting arrangements . this is also the worst-sounding cd ( or lp , for that matter ) that i have ever heard . it sounds worse than lo-res mp3s played over the web ; i have recordings of 78s that sound better . i can not believe that even laserlight would release this . i have other laserlight cds and none of them sound this bad . if they remastered this and made it sound better , i would buy it again . that 's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 . still , it 's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality
0	completely worthless ! if you liked the film , go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities . the sound quality is fair at best , even for a live album . almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary ' at the beginning or end of the song . the `commentary ' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason . it would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries ' on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear . the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees , which means no `killing me softly ' . sadly , you can tell that most of the artists on this album have n't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible , even for a live recording . some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl
1	this movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the dvd , so we searched for the soundtrack . i actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons ... it contains the favorite from the movie , `` i want to grow old with you '' actually sung by adam sandler and secondly , because volume 1 contains the song that adam sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend , which contains quite a bit of profanity , so i did n't want to get it for my kids . i would have given it five stars , but we find the introduction by billy idol at the start of the last track , `` i want to grow old with you , '' which is dialog from the movie , to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song , which i mentioned was the absolute favorite
1	the opening song `` cups '' by the salt lake city orchestra was one of the first songs i downloaded on my ipod . it is such a great mix ! i just love it ! oh yeah ... and the rest of the cds are n't bad either ... ; - )
0	i like most of ac/dc 's music , but i ca n't stand their latest album stiff upper lip . stiff upper lip is the only ac/dc album where you can play it all the way through , and not even hear one good song . stiff upper lip does n't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell . every song on it just bugs the heck out of me . listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience ; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy ! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black . but ... those cds had variety , they were semi original , and they were actually pretty good . this cd is just completely worthless . i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime , but none of them were more pain to listen to than this . the vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums , the music is chunky , repetitive , dull , and boring , and most of the songs sound the same . stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band . the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks . this cd is just unbelievaby terrible . it is a disgrace to this band 's legacy , and the band members should be embarrased by it . oh well , i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract , so i guess they do n't care about how awful it is anyway . all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible . it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to . go buy a good ac/dc cd like let there be rock , high voltage , powerage , highway to hell , or back in black . stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise . it 's so awful i 'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this !
0	i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90 's . this band was one of them . while yes , they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy , they still had enough bad @ ss in them to put on a rad song . i think they should have just did a `` da hui '' single with `` the noose '' and maybe `` cant get my head around you '' on it . this sucks really bad . it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album ! ! if you must hear , download or borrow . please guys . quit or make good music . its pretty pathetic hearing `` hit that '' next to the godawful creed and nickelbland ! ! so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by tsol and the damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this ... a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless
0	hey ! never liked ja fool ! he is and will always be over ! where is he ? ? ? ? ? ? ? like i care ! any way ! ! ! ! 50 has sold 16 million+ cd 's and ja fool had the nerve to say 50 do n't sell ! ! ha ! ! ! ! ! ! ja fool ! ! ! greatest hits ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! nuff said ! over ja fool rule ! !
1	this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal , who has been recording for ecm for 30+ years now . the tracks range from pieces with an `` electric miles '' sound to an orchestrated track . while very diverse , the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique , atmospheric tone and excellent compositions . the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering . informative liner notes as well . highly recommended
0	in general i 'm a big fan of movie music , but to tell the truth i expected more from this one . this soundtrack is incomaparable to say lord of the rings or star wars movie music . it lacks depth and emotion and power . unlike emotionally potent melodies present in lotr soundtrack the eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting . i get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called eragon . i get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track . i hope they 'll make better album for the next movie of the inheritence trilogy .
0	it 's not great music to dance to
0	it is ludicrous to even mention the fact that the duprees have lasted so long and can still be seen in atlantic city considering the fact that there is not one original member of the duprees in the group that is seen in atlantic city . this is a major problem with many groups purporting to be from the 50 's and 60 's . the duprees appearing today is a perfect example of caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who do n't read latin ! for those of us who were duprees fans , this is a not to be missed cd of the original duprees with the incomparable sound of joey vann and harmony that is hard to match . they did joni james proud in their remake of a number of her hits . it is nostalgia personified hearing the original duprees
1	if you 're a dion fan do n't miss this cd . all the hits including my favourite - donna the prima donna
0	i have all 5 volumes and this is the only one i do n't like . the selection of music is just plain bad . there are a few songs that are ok but most are just dull , dull , dull . i recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead
1	i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd . i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records . i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers -- lyle lovett- '' lungs '' ( among others ) and steve earle- '' tecumseh valley '' . i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording . other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes ' records . i come from a different angle . as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise , i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings . i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive .
1	i recently discovered joyce cooling . yeah , i 've been in the dark ages . she is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else . i especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations . she 's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot . you can hear it all in her music . buy revolving door ! you 'll love it
1	i really like this cd a lot and i am looking forward to seeing them live
0	i would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb . quite frankly i would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just reburning these cd 's and reselling them . for 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite
1	this is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the bill evans trio . this was i 'm told bill 's first all ballads record . riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962 . none of the music sounds dated . considering it 's 41 years old . this is the first recording bill made with chuck israels taking over for the late scott lafaro as the bass player . this album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it . the music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection . one goal that bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original sounding jazz . i dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording . to me it sounds more like european classical music . also thank god for bill 's college music theory teacher at southeastern university gretchen magee . because if it werent for her motivation { evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers } he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition `` very early '' { which is the last track on the cd its just breathtaking ... } being an amature pianist myself , `` very early '' and `` childrens play song '' were the first two evans ' compositions i taught myself to play . the piece is a composition played in c major at a slow waltz tempo . he played the tune until the end of his life in 1980 , but the original version on `` moonbeams '' might be the all around finest one . it is given a very slow and delicate treatment , and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow falling gently around you . i also really like his interpretation of `` it might as well be spring '' . i think that bill evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that . he didnt play anything he didnt have to . he always played just the right amount of notes and chords . with this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement . evans once told tony bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on `` truth and beauty . '' with the album `` moonbeams '' fans of evans ' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album . highly recommended
1	umm ... i do n't think you quite got the point of this album . it is not about the artists that you like , it is about the artists that inspired moore . your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh . i find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying `` f*ck you soad '' and so on . have some respect for other 's opinions . unfortunately , you are a steriotypical `` ignorant american '' .so with all that said , and with all due respect , i say , f*ck you pal
0	( it ? ) i have many of david and japan 's albums , but this thinly composed album is repetitive , boring and annoying . i think there were some hidden tracks too , but i just wanted the album to be over . you are better off with `` dead bees on a cake '' , `` secrets of the beehive '' or any bee related titled album of his
0	i agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing from all concerned ( except the cursed drummer ) , i can not imagine what poor jerry gemmot went through with that drummer .. he should have been dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. gawd ' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. i can not listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it 's back to soul of a man , re-kooperation , live adventures , super session , and kooper sessions with shuggie
0	a lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves . ironic lyrics like `` image of the invisible '' do not make them intellectual . this trash is not music . get it off my radio ! if only i could give 0 stars..
1	when this album first came out , i felt jilted . but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album . make no mistake , if you 're a die-hard 80 's rocker , you 'll hate this album . the production is raw , and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed . but that does n't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record . if you can keep an open mind , i think this ablum is one that you 'll love
0	did not care for the selections on this cd
0	boo-wop ? haha ok , anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it . the problem is the singing and the overall production . this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal . the vocals are waaaaay weak . what exactly is a `` re-worked '' debut album ? ? ? i thought once an album was out it was done , set in stone ? apparently not , so mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid ( who changed their first album cover years after it came out ! ) and take the cheezy way out . a definete step up from bands like blitzkid , but still in the cellar of rock n roll . do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
1	i bought this cd since my sister had stolen my original copy , lol . need i say more
1	the fisrt cd is alot better than this one , but this one is still okay . i only liked one song on this disc and it is . track 4 . will the circle be unbroken/i 'll fly away/ jesus loves me . do n't get me wrong the music is beautiful , but i think the first one is alot better
1	i had this album for many years when i was younger . i had looked for along time to try and find it on cd with no luck . i finally found it on amazon . this is my favorite christmas album , i even have my teenage daughter hooked on it now . the caroling medely is awesome and my daugher loves the pinecones and hollyberries song . no one should be without this cd in their christmas collection .
1	i just saw this woman live and she 's amazing ! ! ! ! the songs come alive when you hear them ! it 's hard to put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in . but trust me it 's a good place ! please check her music out if you 're into heartfelt music
1	i purchased this cd during the lowest time of my life emotionally . every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief , especially the title track , deep peace . i would listen to it over and over , bathing in the lush healing sounds . each element , from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs , is seemingly structured at a spiritual level . this is more than ambient music , it 's true music therapy .
0	britain , circa 1997 . tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes . and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public . this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing . to be fair , the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is . rather , they are appealing and prove to be the film 's lone redeeming factor . the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what `` a hard days ' night '' did for the beatles . whereas the fab four 's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it 's trying to say about the spice craze . i was reminded more of the monkees ' `` head '' than i was of `` a hard days ' night '' . lots of celeb cameos ( roger moore , elton john , et al ) that amount to naught . oh , well . on to `` from justin to kelly ''
1	i saw this band open for placebo in tampa , fl . i had never heard of them before that night . i bought the cd immediately . though it 's a bit plain , it 's a great cd . it 's a comforting kind of plain it rocks . i played it in my cd player for about a month straight . the lead singers voice is unique . this band definitely has much potential to become a well known group . a great debut album . if you ever get to see them live do it ! their live show definitely makes the cd come alive .
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something , you could n't do better than to give them this cd . ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm , plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach , making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer . this is not a bad thing -- some complain that bach , with his mathematical leanings , leaves them cold . that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd
0	... when you 're gearing up for suicide . this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery and paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head . this is not a good album for the stressed , because it will just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable , after listening to it more and more i started to get more `` into '' it , but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in . it 's a somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb and hurt my head . people say this is great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself . kid a is just ok to me , and has n't been worth all the effort to `` get into '' . this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners . i do n't know , maybe i 'm missing something , but to hear some `` weird '' music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears , try `` passengers '' by u2 . and thom york sings like a muppet on this album . by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit ( including pablo honey -- why are people always busting its chops ) .
1	have loved this album since it first came out years ago ( bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time ) . the cd was out of print but i kept looking and found it on amazon ( it was re-released ) , yeah ! ! ! ! last steam engine , from the cradle to the grave , louise , owls , you do n't have to need me - some of my favorites . this , to me , is kottke in his prime
0	after reading her excellent halloween book , i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning . i always search for `` different '' halloween cds , but this was filled with the same old stuff . chains , moans , and spooky laughs ... then more chains , moans and spooky laughs . very dissapointing
0	this album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts . the music is simple and straightforward , and the rapping is poor
1	this is quite a sharp turn from francine 's previous album ( 40 on a fall day ) ... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble 's work in poundcake , this time around it 's quieter , subtler , sweeter and sadder . make no mistake , this is a break-up album . even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold , lonely , hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can . the mood will draw you in and keep you listening , but after a few listens it 's the songs you 'll fall in love with . ahh , the songs . they 're densely packed with chord changes , odd but appealing lyrics , and unexpected instrumentation . they 're hooky without being obvious ( a francine specialty ) . this was my favourite album of 2003 , and i still listen to it pretty often these days . best tracks : this sunday 's revival , silver plated 606 , novelty , 13 years . best lyric : `` read a year old mail / now you should 've told me / i 've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly
1	this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film -- cater burwells score is a pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display , with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.also an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination -- bartok 's `` allegro '' ( i know diddly about classical music , but bartok rocks ! ! ) , and a typically great bjork song '' amphibian '' ( in two versions ) , that book-ends the album with an etherial , dream-like haze
0	why are they butchering pac 's songs like this . i advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album . the original ghetto gospel and loyal to the game are 2 of my favorite pac songs but the one 's on here are painful to listen to . afeni should have let dj quik , daz , and whoever else that worked with pac do this album . they should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs . this started with still i rise to until the end of time to better dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one . the 2 stars is 1 because it is pac and another for the song uppercut . the most obvious butcher job is black cotton where em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up pac 's rhyme . i hope they do better with this last album due out this year
1	this is the jacksons second album for epic and producers gamble and huff . it would be their last with gamble and huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should . music 's takin over , different kind of lady and do what you wan na are great , catchy dance tracks . the real greatness here lies in the ballads where michael 's voice is in peak form . even though you 're gone and find me a girl are classic ballads . so good , i feel that find me a girl is probably the best michael jackson song you 've never heard . this is probably michael jackson 's most overlooked album and its one of his best ! the jacksons all sing together great and you can see why destiny and triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded . overall , great ballads , catchy feel good dance tracks , and michael jackson singing his heart out . get this , you will not be dissaponted
1	i purchased this cd after reading one of the reviews . i have another streetwize cd that i love , but i was a litter weary about getting this one ( jazz meets dre and all ) . but i am glad i made the purchase , as i am thoroughly enjoying it
1	i remember hearing of this band when i was just a lad , but i never owned any of their albums , and none of my closest friends played this for me , so this is a great discovery for me . i 'm only on my second listen , but it 's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite . it 's from my favorite rock period , the early seventies , and it 's not only nicely remastered , it 's also remixed , meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks , not the stereo master . i wish more reissues were done this way
1	i like this album . its got a nice mix of old and new material . along with some live material . great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game
1	the title gets it right - this is a very fun album . there are a lot of great songs on here . infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is . one other thing ... it 's a sin that `` we 're the same '' was n't a bigger hit than it was . truly a great song
1	i originally purchased this cd at a local store . so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost . it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all .
1	this was the first punk-o-rama cd i listened to , and boy i was not dissapointed . most of the songs on this cd are the type of punk i would listen to , quite fast and energetic . the best song on the cd has to be either nofx - bath of least resistance ( nofx being the greatest punk band of all time , of course ) , or beatsteaks - let me in . i heard the beatsteaks for the first time on this cd and there absolutely bloody excellent . obviously , the cd is made complete with songs from the descendents , pulley , pennywise , dropkick murphy 's . the only let down on this cd is noise conspiracy , there song on this cd , well plainly sucks i 'm sorry to say . but overall this cd is one hell of a good listen if your into punk . that 's all , oh yeah , buy it ! by
1	not as epically gorgeous as 'once upon a time in america ' , but still lovely . there 's a south american influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack . my favourite track is an ave maria -- in guarani . haunting . however , `` gabriel 's oboe '' is the theme that makes this score . being an oboist , it of course holds a particular appeal to me -- and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to
1	coltranes recordings with his classic quartet of '61-5 varied between very good and stunning . coltrane fans may want to get the impulse ! box set instead though ( which includes this cd and the other works of the quartet
0	great fan of the man they call 'sugar ' zucchero , but this outing is really below par . this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs , with the addition of other famous singers . did he send the original recordings to these people , en did they ad little pieces here and there ? it sounds like it ! none of the songs have gotten ' better compared to the originals . to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money ( and get more attention for 'sugar ' outside of italy ? ) . do n't buy it , get 'oro ' , 'shake ' or 'blue sugar ' instead
1	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time . surprisingly , evans ' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly . perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are . both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing . i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings . highlights are the amazing `` waltz for debby '' and earl zindars ' waltz `` elsa '' , easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written , in my opinion . you simply can not go wrong with this cd
1	i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release - but they have . while `` faded seaside glamour '' is more immediately catchy and refined , `` you see colours '' comes at you in a much more intense manner . the songs are more mature , the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies . the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer , but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release . the delays put it all together - great songwriting , strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody . it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states . buy it
1	the title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing . fitting that category as well are outlaw women , and women i 've never had . hank also lends his southern rockin ' style to white lightnin ' written by j.p. richardson a.k.a . the big bopper . what bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father ? hank serves up a whopper here along with waylon jennings in a classic called the conversation . in a time , much like today , when country was straying from it 's roots hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album
0	being a fan of jack johnson , i thought this one would be as good as the others . i was n't impressed at all . it sounds like a few guys pickin ' around in the basement . the recording quality has very little production value . at best , these are okay live versions of usually great songs . this is an unnecessary piece for your jack johnson collection .
1	very essential music.the arrangements & amp ; styles work very well.he has great depth & amp ; feel here.it 's classic ellington.he was always constantly changing music
0	first show on broadway i ever left at intermission . i bought the tickets because i did n't think i could go wrong seeing a show directed by strohman , starring craig bierko who was fantastic in music man and was flat flat flat in this show , and music by harry connick jr. whom i have loved forever . it taught me that everything has it 's place and harry 's place is not a broadway stage . i hope for his sake , he does not try again . if i could rate something at zero stars , this would get that rating
1	i have a few hundred surf cds and i would have to say thet this cd is my favorite ! my next favorite is their new cd called `` headin ' out '' . they have the reverb and the composition that just makes all of the songs fantastic . if you like instrumental surf you will love this cd ! buy it you wo n't be sorry
0	great cd . imus in the morning recommended highly and the i-man was not wrong . one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years . i listen to a lot of buffett , james taylor , delbert mcclinton , and this cd places high in these ranks
0	zoolook~ jean-michel jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best . after having made amazing albums such as oxygene , equinox and magnetic fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album . i find it a bit too much like modern art , i.e. , confusing , confounding and impossible to grasp . it also seems like jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album . he had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work . this is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album . very disapointing indeed !
0	i should first state that i am a huge ej fan . his music has been extremely important to me over the years . he is , without a doubt , a genius ... i would go so far as to call him the mozart of our times . but , elton can also write bloated , self-indulgent tripe , and if you ask me , this album belongs in that bucket . i give it 2 stars just because of ssmlt , one of his all-time greats . i never cease to be blown away by that song . but the rest of this album ? booooooring ! ! !
0	this movie was only good because of two reasons . rammstein , and queens of the stone age . other than that , completel out of control p.o.s . that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell
1	low tech and brilliant , music that seems to have channeled zappa , winchester cathedral , and god knows what else . incredibly funny , and then suddenly sad . mr pink is a genius , you betcha . and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the industry , in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people 's dreams
1	this ancient jazz classic never sounded better.rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24- bit.he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic . just keep them coming rudy
1	a lot of music fans have mused over why matthew sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs . `` sick of myself '' single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities . but in retrospect sweet simply was n't a very marketable commodity for the music industry , and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow did n't grab people . its not that he does n't sing with passion or feeling , but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix . perhaps its a production thing ; regardless , the vocals on a ms album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter . there are some truly impressive ( albeit derivative ) stuff here : `` what matters '' is in my opinion the greatest byrds song never written , `` hide '' is a beautiful piano ballad that would n't seem out of place on badfinger compilation , `` if time permits '' has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by brian wilson , etc . etc . `` i 've been waiting '' works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire , and `` girlfriend '' is for the most part a great rocker . however , after the relatively simple production of girlfriend , his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a `` wall of sound '' feeling , which quite frankly does n't really work unless you 're phil spector . not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well ( although i probably would have included `` evangeline '' at the expense of `` ready '' ) . despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing . still heartily recommended for fans of catchy , melodic pop-rock
0	ashlee 's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that 's she 's all plastic and no talent . she must of asked the dr to make her look like her sister . very sad cause she 's unrecognizable now . better looking , maybe , still ca n't sing or dance .
1	dave alvin 's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and/or who grew up in this land . the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises . it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state . dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said `` infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels . '' dave alvin says `` we started with a list of 25 songs , from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between . i was even thinking of doing 'going back to cali ' as a blues thing . in the end , though , it was n't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting . '' he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well . of them all , and i like each and every one , my two favorite interpretations are `` here in california '' and `` surfer girl '' `` california bloodlines '' is a sentimental rendition of john stewart 's fine work , which finds peace in knowing `` there 's california bloodlines in my heart / there 's a california woman in my song ... and a california heartbeat in my soul . '' `` redneck friend '' the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin 's style . `` kern river '' is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend , and it is a melancholy rendition . `` blind love '' from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style . `` here in california '' one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson . he felt this song needed a woman 's perspective . `` i 'm bewildered '' is an old richard berry , the great guitarist 's tune . backed up by the calvenes . `` sonora 's death row '' written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter 's tale . `` down on the riverbed '' is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin 's old blues style . `` between the cracks '' a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman , with a rollicking tune . this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd . `` do n't look now '' a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival . bluesy and fun to make it dave 's . `` tramps and hawkers '' by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz , come dance with me , bk . lyrics are wonderful . `` loser '' by jerry garcia and robert hunter , is darker with more infused blues than garcia 's version . it could n't sound less like a deadhead song . dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound `` surfer girl '' brian wilson 's first song is done with doo-wops and again the calvanes did background . this is my favorite of dave alvin 's interpretations , and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek . dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd . voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the `` brown earth of the state '' to the frontier life and the lives won and lost . dave alvin had made his mark on this state , and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love . play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd . `` california dreamin ' ? '' highly recommended . prisrob 6-04-06
1	no use thumbing the pages of cale 's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography , 'what 's welsh for zen ? , to glean hard data on this one melodic gem . coming after the heady , if problematic days of the velvets , there 's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format . the abrasive thrashing rock of 'mcbeth ' ( while indicating his imminent direction ) serves the one discordant note . throughout , cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past . language had been severed from lineal meaning , in rock , since bob went electric . pete brown writing for jack bruce 's towering masterpieces , 'songs for a sailor ' , 'harmony row ' ; keith reid with procul harum , were mixing up the lyric medicine , presumably with other pharmacuticals making sumptuous music on a par with 'paris 1919 ' . that date ? the birth of surrealism , ( and similar writing to cale 's efforts herein ) perhaps ? the russian revolution ? cale 's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it , which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs ; stretched out vowells on , 'planing lakes ' , 'elephants that sing ' , 'looking out from here at half past france . ' it was far from banal music , however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings , viola piano cale painted . these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung . 'locusts ' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness . 'fragments of a rainy season ' is a good retrospective concert . and some of the fuge written around the hommage to andy warhol is very moving stuff . go john
1	i was a big fan of this band 's song `` rock'n'roll highschool '' , and i recently saw the documentary about them , so , when i saw this anthology selling for around $ 15 in australia , i thought i 'd take a punt by buying it . my thoughts on this album are similar to the ones i had for the 3 cd johnny o'keefe collection [ reviewed at this site by me ] . namely , overall , the album is very listenable , with some standout tracks . as with the jok album , this album is/was great value for money , considering how many songs you get for the price . of the songs i particularly like on this album , and the ones i have been listening to quite a bit , are : rock'n'roll high school . this song still rocks after all these years . do you remember rock'n'roll radio ? good song , though it never got the airplay that the previous song seemed to get here in australia . chinese rock . an easter egg song ! ! never heard this song before , but it is an instant classic . very catchy . danny says . another easter egg song . takes some repeated listening to get into , but once you do that , it gets high rotation on your cd player . to me , i can see why the ramones are considered founders of punk . at least as far as the music is concerned . however , the sex pistols truly define punk for me . they have the whole package which i identify with punk ... namely , the punk sound , and the incendiary , anarchistic lyrics . the ramones are more middle-class sounding , to my ears at least . i 'm surprised at how poppy/boppy the ramones are . to me they sound like a punk motown band . one of the songs on the 2nd cd , i think , has that classic punk sound , but i did n't make a note of the title . might have to edit that song in later ... could be `` endless vacation '' ? lastly , the song danny says , almost comes across as a punk beach boys song . overall , the anthology is often 'samey ' , but listenable nonetheless , with a handful of songs that i consider 'high rotation ' worthy . just remembered , `` endless vacation '' seems a terrific song too . will have to listen to that some more-i 've currently got the 1st cd in my cd player . p.s . listened to this song last night . really good-the fast talking bit in the song reminds me of the equally good , if not better song by australian act tism [ or this is serious mum ] - '' [ he 'll never be an ] ol ' man river '' , about river phoenix , amongst other people . tism , like the ramones , can do bad taste well .
0	afi used to be a pretty good band . then , they decided to go emo-girlie-boy . the lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy . what happened to smeely-goth-dude ? some of us actually like the music , not the `` emoness '' . not only that , but `` miss murder '' was waaaaay overplayed , and now it is encrested into my brain . i mean , come on , it 's not even that good of a song . afi is looking to appeal to the mainstream . there 's nothing wrong with that , if you keep your old sound , which this band has failed to do . this , my friends , is afi 's worst album , if not hte worst album of 2006 . check out the older afi stuff . `` sing the sorrow '' is okay , but if you want truley good music , you have to go back into their ninties albums
0	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it . i ordered the soundtrack from the movie , but it was not the soundtrack . they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part . all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included . i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack . i was disappointed .
1	this cd is a must for any horn player or lover of the instrument ! cerminaro has tremendous technique and extremely sensitive mucicality . en
0	i got the cd with only disc 2 ... it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus ... im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one ...
1	i 've always liked tevin campbell , he had a beautiful voice and really did it on `` break it down '' . i particularly like break it down , shhh , brown eyed girl among others.. excellent cd overall .
1	the first cd from baby anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare . i would n't claim that 's a bad thing , but do n't expect to be surprised if you 're familiar with the genre . overall it 's a solid offering from baby anne and delivers the bass . the second cd is a surprising mix from jen lasher , who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel . to those who have labeled this `` industrial '' i will say first and foremost that you are wrong . there is not one remotely industrial track on the cd . what she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop , house , and a couple breaks tracks , all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare , sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound . from someone quite familiar with electropop artists i ca n't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike . my only complaint is the strikingly misplaced wolfsheim track , which i can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false depeche mode comparison from another reviewer .
0	chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again . fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions . nicks latest attempts have been pathetic ... from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint ... even his older 'pop ' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days ... no , we 're not saying recycle the older productions , but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality ' in the profuctions ... a signature if you will ... and hey , it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class ... yes , how the mighty have fallen ... oh brother..
1	without getting too much into it this album is pretty good . 4 stars for some bad ass tracks . my favs are tears from the moon , beautiful things , as the rush comes . all in all worth the money
0	oh my goodness rodger , oh my goodness . just oh my gosh , i 'm just stunned . this is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme . yeah , you heard me , this is chyme . ok , let 's see , let 's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop/country crossovers ... . what do we get , half-baked , half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight . well , they 're probably smarter than me ... ... ... .. i 'm like as smart as a fungi . no one needs to know and whose bed have your boots been under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample . before i get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils i 'll say something nice . come on over was an excellent effort , with all kinds of hooks , great production ( errr , i mean it is robert `` i 'm actually dead '' lang ) , and all kinds of fun . up ! was even better ( i 'm not going to praise it too much , though , i mean , i am an 18 year old guy ... ... so i already feel like i should be staring at a picture of kevin sorbo or something ... which is not cool , i mean unless it 's just hero worship , i could worship kevin sorbo ) ! but still , we have this horrible , stinking , steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet ( it 's intended target ) ... ... looks like someone has bad aim
0	there is not enough space for me to explain why this film ( and soundtrack ) are woefully inadequate of the name dr. seuss . the fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism ( what the book was complaining about , wake up people ! ) and james horner 's score which has a couple of nice moments but does n't have that seussian sound . 'where are you christmas ' is annoying beyond all reason and i mean both versions . and whose bright idea was it to have jim carrey mangle 'you 're a mean one ' ? if you 're looking for a more grinch like score , go find elfman 's nightmare before christmas
1	this cd is truly a classic and one of my all-time favorites . love it
1	does anyone know whether this set will become available on sacd or dvd audio format ? how would you contact grp records to ask ? i only give it four stars until multichannel format appears .
0	i listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band i did n't like this one , one bit , but than again it was also for my husband . i definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music
1	with a compelling story , great music , great lyrics , and two outstanding female leads , aida certainly delievers . right from the start with the goregous `` every story is a love story '' , the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show . the seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless . the three stars of the show each being something different to this recording . while adam pascal is always great , he 's the weak point on this recording . i much more prefer him in rent , and i do n't think his voice suits this show very well . sherie renee scott is teriffic as amneris , and her powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and `` i know the truth '' . the star , however , is heather headley as aida . her tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized on this recording with big , raw , emotional , and powerful voice . she 's is perfect in every way
0	i like these guys alot.i own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live . i played this cd a few times liked it at first , but it did n't grow on me at all liked i 'd hoped.to cute for me , not spontaneous enough.i feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.just let it rip guys , that 's what you do best.thank god my brother bought this instead of me.i bought live at cow palace ( the dead ) great cd
1	this is a great album . two of their biggest hits , `` another one bites the dust , '' and `` crazy little thing called love , '' are here . my favorites are `` need your loving tonight , `` and `` prime jive . '' most of the other songs are top notch , too . none of the later queen albums matched this one . definitely in the class of night at the opera , day at the races and news of the world
0	it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer . yeah , maybe my fish can get a record deal : they `` sing '' in tone , can breath , but refue to lip-synch ( i know it sounds gay ) . this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments , write their own songs , and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention . let 's take the band king 's x : doug pinnick ( vocals/bass ) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god ( king 's x is a christian band ) ; ty tabor ( guitar/vocals ) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know ; and jerry gaskill ( drums/vocals ) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns ... yet only like a few dozen people ( i know a lot more people than that like kx ; i 'm just exagerating ) seem to like this band . it 's sad . if you want good music , listen to the band i just menioned ( king 's x if you were n't paying attention ) . ( if amazon does n't post this i will seriously get poed !
0	i 'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you : this cd is not like the other putumayo cds . no , it is not fun , hip , relaxing , good to dance to , or stimulating . it is a selection of hackneyed sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices . i have this rule for music : if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta , it sucks . consider yourself warned . if you like good music , try french cafe instead
1	i was thrilled to see this available on cd ... ... ... . it is the most delightful christmas 'album ' of it 's time it continues to delight ! i purchased several and gave to friends for christmas - every single receipient was immediately thrilled to have this 'album ' on cd stating , 'this was my favorite , where 'd you find it ? '' great gift
1	my husband and i play this cd all the time . we both love it
0	do not buy this cd . he is definitely wack . his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats . as a member of `` children of the corn '' he was weak and he still is weak . the other member of his dip-set crew outshine him on his own cd ... how lame is that . through away any cam'ron cd 's you own and immediately replace them with music by jay-z .
1	i bought this cd six months ago because i am a miami vice fan . i did n't expect it to be good , but it is wonderful . `` in dulce decorum '' is incredible ! this is a hard-to-find cd . you will love it ! i enjoy it more with each playing
1	this is my all time favourite jacksons album . this album , along with `mama ca n't buy you love ' and anything by donna summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the states as a kid . comprising mainly jackson compositions ( and production ) , it showed a more mature and funky side of the group , and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy motown works . filled with their trademark smooth harmonies , lots of horns and michael 's distinctive vocals , the album hit # 11 on the billboard album charts ( # 3 r ) , was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in `shake your body ( down to the ground ) ' # 7 pop . `blame it on the boogie ' opened the album in style , a funky upbeat disco tune that one could n't keep still while it played . other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden `things i do for you ' , the frenetic `all night dancin '' , and the shimmery `shake your body ' with its distinctive riff , which hinted at future mj songs like `do n't stop till you get enough ' and `workin ' day and night ' . for me however , the songs that really did it for me were the ballads . `push me away ' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from michael , alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease . great horns ! title track `destiny ' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where michael declares `if it 's the rich life i do n't want it/happiness aint always material things ' . great backing harmonies too . `bless his soul ' is simply stunning ! featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what 's right , but never seeming to please anyone . `you just ca n't please the world and yourself ' sings jackie . this song starts off tender with congas , fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of `the life you 're living is dangerous ' and a fab outro of `hey , ha ha ha ' . then comes the final track and my favourite . the dramatic `that 's what you get for being polite ' . a thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings , and then michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love . dazzling instrumentation , a stellar vocal performance from michael , the cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros , and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers . one of my favourite childhood albums , one of my all time favourite albums , and a classic !
0	charlotte church had the most beautiful and captivating voice i ever heard when she debuted . i purchased all of her albums and played them to death . this cd is horrible ! her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it . some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up . ridiculous ! she could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew . this is simply a tragic waste of talent
1	this is a wonderful vangelis album and is fairly energetic , with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged . released in 1975 , heaven and hell incorporates a full choir into the vangelis sound . vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers , electric piano , acoustic piano , a full drum kit , and percussion . vangelis is joined by the english chamber choir ( conducted by guy protheroe ) with vana veroutis as the lead female vocal , in addition to jon anderson ( vocals/lyrics on heaven and hell ( part 1 so long ago , so clear ) . vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano . as a huge yes fan , i was delighted to hear jon 's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics . as far as the inclusion of the choir goes , i did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording . the heaven and hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including part i ( 21'58 '' ) and part ii ( 21'16 '' ) . in general , the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by vangelis . another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages . of course , my favorite part comes at the end of part i , which is the 4'58 '' section with jon on vocals . this short `` song '' is quite moving and uplifting . movement ii is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two . the choir is featured on the second movement , along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented vana veroutis . part ii closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section , which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section . all in all , this is a good vangelis album and is recommended along with albedo 0.39 ( 1976 ) ; spiral ( 1977 ) ; and the excellent opera sauvage ( 1979 )
1	one of the best doobie collections out there `` greatest hits '' lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career . some of the songs here are the single versions ( meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions ) and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs . maybe it 's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the cd . either way fans may want to be aware of that . in fact even on the boxed set we get `` listen to the music '' , `` nobody '' and `` rockin ' down the highway '' in their single incarnations . perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio . either way , fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import `` greatest hits '' collections or wait for the remastered cds coming out later this year . this set does have one track not on the boxed set -- '' without you '' a great rocker . the cd booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently . this definitely covers the highlights of the band 's career whether it be the tom johnston rockin ' years , michael mcdonald 's blue-eyed soul stage or the band 's reunion phase this has a bit of it all . personally , i would love to see a two disc distillation of the band 's `` greatest hits '' with a second disc of album tracks such as `` i cheat the hangman '' , `` losin ' end '' , `` the captain and me '' and `` how do the fools survive ? '' . in the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans . the sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by bill inglot for the boxed set . detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued `` best of '' pair to shame . this is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 `` nobody '' to their last ( when this compilation was put togetherin 2001 ) `` dangerous '' released in 1991 .
1	i bought this the year it came out , after seeing george in concert and it is great ! most of these were big hit songs and i found that i really loved the others too especially hard day
0	i love the `` smoky '' piano bar sound of this album . i picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh
1	i 'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews , this cd is amazing . it 's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave - but it 's amazing none-the-less . every song on here is beautifully written , and , as always , cornell 's voice does n't disappoint . it 's different , but one of my new favorite cds
1	i consider this the first album in the second half of the career of oasis . following the departure of bonehead and guigsy , this album is basically all the gallagher brothers . having learnt lessons from be here now , oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from be here now . while the songs are not as good on here , they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it was n't as rushed . this signifies a big change of direction for the band , with little less ego 's and a more sober approach to their music , it is only the songwriting that lets this album down . my least favourite of all oasis albums , it features two really good songs , 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones . it is missing another two songs to make it complete , i think it should have included the b'sides 'lets all make believe ' and 'carry us all ' . it still includes a few beatle-esque songs 'who feels love ' and 'roll it over ' and noel once again takes over lead vocal duties , this time on two tracks , 'where did it all go wrong ' and 'sunday morning call ' . this is a very important album , it grounded the band again after their ego 's had taken off . this helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today
0	i would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art . there are those that `` appreciate '' unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they do n't . . . just as the emporer 's subjects `` ooh '' ed and `` ah '' ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
1	one ca n't go wrong with this one . a classic , which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night . and , a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra ... before the days of electronic music
0	i was ( and still am ) a huge fan of `` mr. show '' . it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription . it 's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created `` mr. show '' produced this weak offering . might be the least funny comedy cd i 've ever heard . virtually all the material in the album has been done before , and much better , by other comedians . most of the bits just lay there and die . mr. cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot . sorry , it just does n't work . do n't waste you money on this one . get the `` mr. show '' dvds instead and forget this ever existed .
1	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition . only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks , samples , and guitars . cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant
1	this album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings . sheryl crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history . sheryl shines on her own , singing some of her great hits , but it 's the duets that really make the album . my least favorite has to be the dixie chicks just because i ca n't appreciate the country flare they bring to `` strong enough '' but it 's still a great version . chrissie hynde , one of the album 's highlights , brings intense attitude to `` if it makes you happy '' , still one of my favorite sheryl songs . stevie nicks remains stevie nicks , giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own `` gold dust woman . '' sarah mclachlan 's usually soft voice comes out strong on `` the difficult kind '' and compliments sheryl 's quite nicely . my favorite rendition has to be eric clapton and sheryl together on cream 's `` white room '' , the rock-out moment on the album . the show is complete when all the guests return to belt out bob dylan 's `` tombstone blues '' and close the show with a definite bang
0	it sounds like someone somehow got the deftones to suck worse than they already do . this album is n't nearly as musically interesting as tear from the red . i do n't mind the singers new approach to vocals , but it just sounded like they did n't try at all . all the songs sound the same , the tempo is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound , and hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between recordings just makes the album drag . although they 've goten much tighter as a band and are n't as sloppy as they used to be , ( they fell out of sync a lot in the opposite of december ) this album was definitely a backwards step in their progression as real musicians . save your money and buy tear from the red instead
0	while there are some flashes of brilliance in this album , it is compromised by a lack of direction . the 'tastes so sweet ' mix of rapture is beautiful , although cut far too short . faithless , afrika bambaataa & amp ; soulsonic , and crystal method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album . the high point , without contest , is darude 's ripping mix of rising star 's 'touch me ' . this is a cut to throw on for the peak ... when you find the party is just outside of barstow with hunter . that said , then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album . these are more appropriate in an adolescent brit girl 's drawer next to the spice girls . for some labels , this would be normal , for ministry however , it is a dissapointment
1	this cd was beautifully sung by the cambridge singers , a boys/mens choir , mostly a ' capela . it 's the first christmas cd i 've bought that really tempts me to crank up the volume so i can revel in every note
0	jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy , but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums . if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you , but he missed the mark with me big time
1	from the manic whirlwind prelude to the shocking cake and sodomy , portrait of an american family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable . cake and sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures , lunchbox is told with a twist of humor , organ grinder is pleasing vocally , cyclops is addictingly wild , get your gunn is catchy ( if not overly insulting ) , dope hat is great and fierce , and my monkey is hysterically enjoyable . snake eyes and sissies is another winner , easy to get lost in . the rest all work to varying degrees , though not as appealing . every song on this album is worth listening to , from fast paced and rock style to techno overload .
0	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it . i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again , it was my first time and probably my last . liz snyde
0	i bought the cd because i thought it was instrumental music . then i hit the tracks with vocals - yikes ! this is the only cd of lee ritenour that i bought . i am a first time listener . i must say that i do like the instrumental music very much . however , i really hate the tracks with vocals .
0	ya , abomination to god also set it right in his worthy review . i remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that `` one call away '' and `` right thurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr '' garbage . does 2 stars explain anything ? this apparently is equal to that d4l s*** , which is actually the lowest of the low . anyways , did n't i tell you chingy would die one year after -jackpot- hit ? now that he 's dead , everybodies focused on t-pain , oh s*** !
0	this cd just does n't have the quality it should . some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as danny boy . i have the cassette and it was great but this just does n't do justice to ray price or his songs
0	roni griffith has just come out with her new release `` only you '' its great ! ! ! ! ! [ ... ] she has come back so much stronger . check it out . evi
0	i love plenty of contemporary country music ... everything from `` new bluegrass '' ( alison krauss union station ) to `` new country '' like reba mcentire , rascal flatts , brad paisley , martina ... even a lot of faith shania . but i think this cd is crap . the single star is for the only good song on the album , `` heads carolina , tails california '' -- but really , 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous . i 'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are ... elementary-school rhyming , uninspired melody lines , stupid lyrics , below-average accompaniment , etc . one of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song ... i 'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words , and she was trying to overcompensate . the result should be titled `` hooked on phonics , starring jodee messina . '' listen to the preview of `` on a wing and a prayer '' for a good example of what i 'm talking about . i thank my lucky stars i borrowed this cotton candy from the library , rather than shelling out $ 16 for one song . do yourself a favor and buy `` heads carolina , tails california '' online if you must have it
0	she does sound like a goat bleating . yodeling . it 's a shame , really .
0	i ca n't believe i just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten ( ten ! ! ) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit . by the third version , my brain turned to jelly . by the fifth , i needed a drink . by the final re-mixed version , my hangover already started to set in . this e.p . is for dj 's and masochists only . - tom rya
0	this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet 's other three releases . it 's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych . `` belonging , '' `` my song , '' and `` nude ants '' are all virtuoso , spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed . but , i 'd go nada on this one if i were you . i was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was `` hum-drum . '' and she 's 88 , likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime . ( it 's past `` late night willie 's '' bedtime too , i hate to tell you . ) heck , i 've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this `` keith and the somnambulists '' incarnation . garbarek sounds like he 's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos . i ca n't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus . ( neither can christensen . ) les scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then , maybe , they start thinking about picking up musical instruments . jarrett is as wired as ever , but even he ca n't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented , forced and cumbersome . how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet 's tight integration , displayed amazingly well elsewhere , is beyond me . with the exception of `` innocence , '' none of the compositions are very good , either . `` oasis '' has an interesting , if dire , melody line , but it ca n't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it . unlike the other three releases mentioned above , this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz , where none of the musicians are feeding off each other . i do n't enjoy this kind of jazz , so cliched and unintegrated . it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion . you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper , too demented to use the passing lane . ( yes , i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and , yes , i now have a headache . ) there is an interesting part at the end , however , where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways . but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part . only `` innocence '' benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon . it is a beautiful lullabye , arguably jarrett 's best composition . true , the `` nude ants '' version is all you need really , but something happens on this version of the song that is very special . jarrett puts in one of his best , if not his best , jazz piano performances . the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists , who are still pulling a code 9 , ca n't screw it up even if they want to . ( there is a halo around keith jarrett 's head i bet you . ) garbarek ( somnambulist # 1 ) plays the melody with a lot of heart , but he screws up the tempo in a very brief , weak improvisation . the man is tapped , knows it and decides it 's time to end the song . palle danielsson ( somnambulist # 2 ) misses a lot of notes ( doubly bad on double bass ) and goes off into an ill-conceived , top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song . like garbarek , he knows enough to stop and retreat , letting jarrett take over . i ca n't remember a dang thing about somnambulist # 3 ( christensen ) . but jarrett 's effort can not be touched and he plays like a true wizard . a week later at the village vangard ( `` nude ants '' ) , they 'll all be playing at this level . if anything , i 'd like to see the pm version of `` innocence '' included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert . for the most part here , we get hum-drum mountains , where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea , with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined . in particular , garbarek 's performance on `` nude ants '' is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his `` norwegian up . '' maybe they were n't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - new york used to be like this you know - and , well , it just might be your last gig . on `` personal mountains , '' it 's all polite `` thank yous '' and japanese clapping robotically . not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze . not even a bonze meditating for more . but , that manfred eicher , such a card , i tell you .
1	rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired . melodies are beautifully simple and soothing , sounds are particularly well crafted . a great album . the drum box could be a bit more discreet though
1	nothing deep , by any means , but simply a light , airy listen , with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes . even though the songs ( most of them ) were n't in the movie , they remind me of it , of the whole hawaiian atmosphere . my favorite tracks , excluding the ones included on the previous cd , are blue hawai'i ( by elvis ) , my little grass shack , coconut ( it 's just bizarre , but addicting , making you smile with absurdity ) , island in the sun , pineapple princess , and love me tender . again , it 's nothing dramatic or swirling , but it you adored lilo stitch ( and how can you not ? ) and all it stood for , this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day . do n't think about it . listen and pretend you 're there
0	this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville , until he can make a real new album , not this microwaved crapola . if you like buck , get straight outta cashville , an beg for mercy , than wait for his future release , with actual new tracks . i strongly advise you not to buy this . it is a total rip off . i wasted my time downloading this
1	ok , i just could not resist coming on here to review this . i 've had this cd for about 4 years now and i still listen to quite a bit , proof right there that this cd is definetly a classic ( in my book at least ) every single song on here is original , the guitar riffs are simply amazing , and the lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home and how breathtaking they are . if your a goo goo doll fan , and you still do not have this cd , i deeply encourge you to go buy it now ! this is the is the goos like you 've never heard them before . the cd is pure genius , and in my opinion the best cd i 've ever heard
1	did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the fm station sound about the same ? maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars ? the libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough . their raw , loud style is closer to punk than any other genre , but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans . make no mistake , though , this is a loud album . with the exception of the oddly balladish `` radio america , '' it 's a pretty steady sonic assault , and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between `` louie louie '' and live dylan on the intelligibility scale . what can be understood is more erudite than you 'd expect , though . `` what a waster '' is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction , `` boys in the band '' is the best groupie song i 've heard in a long time , and `` the good old days '' actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords . decipherable or not , most of the other songs are at least very catchy . the whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now .
0	van dyke parks did the arrangements on sam phillips 's debut 'the indescribable wow ' , an album i love so much i thought i 'd give 'song cycle ' a shot . what a feeerocious disappointment ! i 'd give it zero stars if i could , but amazon would n't let me ! my god , that singing voice of his reminds me of david bowie ... `` the laughing gnome '' bowie , that is ... i 've seen the word `` coy '' pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing , er , style , but i 'll go them all one better ... `` smug '' . all i hear in it is `` ooh , i 'm so smart . what a clever lad am i . '' the arrangements or orchestrations , or whatever you call them are all pointless . it gives me the feeling that van 's dad bought him an orchestra and said , `` here , son , have fun . '' so young van did ... without ever really learning how to use it properly . randy newman knows how to use an orchestra ; check out his best album 'sail away ' . the arrangements are tasteful and , key word here , spare . he never clubs us over the head with them . the lyrics , if we can call them such , have no attachment whatsoever to the music ... . but then again since i wrote that the arrangments are pointless i guess it 's to be expected . so , what we have is a trifecta of awfulness : bad voice , bad lyrics , and bad music . however , he did make 'song cycle ' in 1968 and worked on 'the indescribable wow ' in 1988 ... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years , namely that arrangements are not songs ; they 're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener ... maybe randy pulled him aside once to tell him that ...
0	the songs just did not get me dancing . i have to say i was disappointed . but i love kids favorite songs vol 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
1	i bought this recording along with blood on the tracks recently and all i can say is `` doggonit '' it do n't get any better than this . they called elvis the king but bob dylan must be the `` wizard '' . who will tell us great stories when he is gone ?
0	i am very dissapointed with this dualdisc , because there is no comment ( worning ) about dvd region protection . what can i do with this disc - region 1 , in europe ( region 2 ) ? my message for sony corporation is : `` this format will not exist for long with dvd region protection ! sorry. '' . my first , and last dualdisc . back to the sacd
1	as a band , the byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history . adding to that legacy , `` mr. tamborine man 's '' status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question . this band could do it all ; country , folk , rock , jam , psychedelica , etc , etc . and this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements . though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ( `` notorious byrd brothers '' ) , this was where the band was the most solid , the most tight collectively . dylan 's influence is everywhere from the get-go ; 4 of his songs span the album , including the title track which the byrd 's turned into his only # 1 hit . elsewhere , there are two other covers , but the songs with the best longevity are originals , mostly penned by gene clark . witness the tortured romance of `` i 'll feel a whole lot better '' and `` here without you '' and tell me he was n't a great songwriter . roger mcguinn ( or jim , if you like ) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence tom petty , among others . obviously , not everyone had found their place ; songs by chris hillman and david crosby are nowhere to be found . but `` mr. tamborine man '' stand today every bit as tall as the early works of dylan and the beatles . this is the album that set the standard for folk-rock from then on , from buffalo springfield to rem to toad the wet sprocket to the most current emo bands . overall : 10 out of 10
1	i put off buying this for many years . having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous , i did n't want to taint my perceptions of the queen legacy . so i ignored this album . then , one day , i was listening to innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again . i came here and read many positive reviews , so i took the plunge . i came out the other side very content . the legacy had not been tainted . the album is uneven in places , but the songs that are good are very good ( mother love , let me live ) . with some albums like this , it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in . now , i do n't know exactly how this was done , but the songs feel seamless , even the dance track `` you do n't fool me , '' which i can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club . of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out ( especially in `` mother love '' ) , but upon the conclusion of the album , i want to say to the brian and the boys ( men ) , `` you 've done good .
1	i am a motown , oldies , r & amp ; b , soul , love songs , music lover.i like the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come alive to the rhythem and bill withers definately fits right in there . i do n't realy have a favorite artist because i like sooooo many of them but if i had to pick my top 10 , this album would be in there
1	the one song i know is a remake is `` goodnight my love . '' i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake . but the others with which i 'm familiar - but do n't have original vinyl to compare , only memories - seem authentic . the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes .
0	only way you are gon na like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk , and you think that 'll make you cool . this cd just does n't display musical talent , maybe originality , but this is not high quality music
1	i 'm not sure what took me so long to get it , but i 'm just coming across this album . it never made a blip on my radar i guess . anyway , i saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $ 2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless ( it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store ) . obviously the owner before me did n't know what they had on their hands and the store manager did n't know either due to it 's low price tag . balance is a must have album without question . it came out in '03 , i 'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh . there are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review . of the 16 joints ( including the bonus track ) , i 'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing . akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap ( even amongst underground emcees ) . the songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same . i did mention that there were two songs that i could 've done without . those songs are `` hand that rocks the cradle '' and `` always bet on ak '' . they are n't bad , but i find myself skipping them everytime i play this cd . balance is a must have lp . i still feel a bit cheated since i just found out about this album . there has to be some sort of promotion for this guy . i did get the black dialogue ( perceptionists ) album and i knew about the lost adats and the ep , but somehow i completely missed this one . do n't be like me , if you have n't heard this yet , grab it as soon as you can . you wo n't regret it . this is one of the best albums on 2003 . highly reccomended . standout tracks : time , woman ii , remind my soul , balance , hypocrite , limelight , front days , here now , wreck dem feat . mr. lif , cooler heads , feedback feat . diamond d , and bone crushe
1	while nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry between travolta and stowe , the sublime soundtrack is another story . descriptions such as `` haunting '' and `` soul moving '' are right on the money , one might also add ineffable to the list .
1	poison the well are one of those bands that i was really big on right when i first started listening to them , but which faded a lot pretty quickly . i ca n't really say why . i like their work , but it does n't inspire me the way it used to . still , i do like them , and this album particularly . maybe not as much as opposite of december , but whatever . yes , this is n't as 'hardcore ' as their older stuff , but i 've never been hardcore kiddie . ( i 'm a metalhead ) and frankly , being a modern hardcore band ai n't much of a compliment in my book . it 's funny , lotsa tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good , but most straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring . so , while old ptw was semi-technical metalcore , this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo . but , they now how to be 'emotional ' and not come across as sissies , ( well , most of the time ) and jeff does n't sing in an unbearably affected manner . course , the 'extremely loud ' part helps a lot too , and jeff 's growls/screams are absolutely devastating . way better than on their previous albums , and some of the best extreme vox from anyone , ever . as an extremely heavy emo album , the instrumentation here is pretty bland . there is n't much real riffing going on , not in the metal sense anyway , mostly just a single note/chord repeated a great many times , than another one etc . but , the vox and atmospherics carry the day . the standout track is 'crystal lake ' , an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore . i 've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day , but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks i 've ever heard , largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox . lotsa extreme vox lack emotion , but never moeria 's ( probably spelling that wrong , sorry ) that , and the instruments are more noteworthy , very nasty and chaotic . also , it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics . ( for the culturally backward , this song is a first-person narrative from jason voorhees , killer of most of the 'friday the 13th ' films . hence the name 'crystal lake ' . ) there are no truly weak tracks here . 'ghostchant ' is a good opener , nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album , mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox . 'loved ones ' is one of the very best tracks , again carried almost entirely by the powerful vox . tracks 5 is a cool two part thing mixing the rather pleasant , harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic , grinding main songs . the album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8 . 'apathy is a cold body ' is a very emo-y track , but it 's got a lot of nice melody to it , so it works . 'sound like the end of the world ' is another strange one . it 's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines . not the best thing here , but it works and it earns some points for being different . yes , a solid , if not great album . check it out
0	nothing like eon . eon is the one . this was a hack sequel with no guts . very dissapointing
0	there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano , he would have composed for it . let 's consider another possibility : if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep , he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea , since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers . for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament , it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these `` pedagogical '' compositions . in other words , the point is lost .
0	now , if we 're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts , but maybe just because people are lowering their standards . besides , the fact that i dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges , this cd is no `` dangerously in love '' . where beyonce 's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album , cole 's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me . aside from the obvious car banger `` i just want it to be over '' and the wildly popular `` love '' ( which cole butchers when singing live by the way ) , nothing here surprises me . like i said , you can call me a hater , but with women like beyonce and fantasia around cole 's fire will probably be put out soon
0	well , unless you are a hardcore collector like myself ( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago ) , stay clear of this album . if you want to hear noise that you your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself , then forget this album make your own noise . the best track on the album is the bonus track . that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music . i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging ; - ) . search judemac forever '' on msn
0	this album is one of the best sonic youth album ... i advise everyone to listen this album ... break the circle of common popular music ... this album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..
0	i like a little bit of it , doesent mean its good , i wont throw it away or anything , ill just let it sift ... wait ... and look at the album cover most of the time . slayer is getting better though
1	you wo n't stop bobbin yo head until its over . i bought this when it first came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is happy to hear it , cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was , he just never got the exposure that biggie did
1	a great recording . `` the greatest bass solo ever recorded '' ( as put by another reviewer ) is certainly a stretch , but the album is still magnificent . heavy sounds is a title that accurately describes the music . buy and enjoy .
0	i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band , so with that in mind , i though i 'd try osftgh . what i hear , and it certainly seems i 'm missing out on something , is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting . just because you have mead dripping from your beard , and you scream out lyrics that contain , no mercy , vengeance and `` it 's your time to die '' does not mean you can create `` authentic '' viking/metal . these idiots could definitely take lessons from : enslaved , manegarm , falkenbach to name a few . do n't fall for the hype !
0	it might not be a good album but it definitely shows shania 's potential
0	a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one . that 's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible . there was only one direction they could go -- up . it 's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp . i said this about the young , fly , flashy album , and the same applies here , so i 'll say it again : when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow , your album is in serious trouble . but let me balance that statement though . this is n't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics . this is simple , bass heavy , crunk music . it 's effective in it 's purpose , but it 's totally generic ( the recipe for most party songs ) . and some of these songs are just flat out horrible . `` stop callin ' me '' is n't only horrible , but it is n't about anything if you 're paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it ( and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped ) . and who 's idea was it to let dame dash ( yeah , that dame dash ) scream all over a song ( bricks 4 the high ) ? i want to know who the guy was that said `` yeah , that 's a good idea '' . dame is doing what he does best , so he 's not at fault ... ..i blame the idiot that put him on the song . `` suckas come and try me '' is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album . and if you ask me , the `` white tee '' remix was a step backward from the original . it would help if they could talk about something other than `` haters '' , postin ' up on the block ( i swear they say that on the album at least 100 times ) , rims , jewelry , and weed . but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess . besides , if people buy this , why should they change ? that 's another story though . in short , the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack . the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ( `` i 'll make you 1 2 step like ciara '' ? come on , i could write that in my sleep ) and it 's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar . once you understand the purpose of this album though , then you can find a few decent tracks , but do n't go getting your hopes up just yet . there are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing . `` my music '' is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b 's good appearance . the best beats on the album are on `` do n't play with me '' feat . three six mafia and `` freaky as she wan na be '' . `` do n't play with me '' features production from dj paul juicy j , so you know it 's tight . i love three six , so that 's my favorite song on the album . and `` freaky as she wan na be '' will be the second single off the album if they 're smart . on top of our game is good for what it 's supposed to be good for ( partying and ... .well , that 's it ) , but not much else . jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant , but i do n't know if this approach is gon na help him any . this album is better than their debut , but that 's not really saying much . this should be pretty obvious , but i 'll say it anyway . if you 're into lyrics , then this is n't for you . if you want crunk beats to bounce to , then this is right up your alley . it depends on your preference , but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one . standout tracks : freaky as she wan na be , i think they like me ( remix ) feat . jd , da brat , bow wow , do n't play wit me feat . three six mafia ( my favorite ) , and my music feat . bun b .
1	for anyone who loves trumpet music as i do , this album is a must . wynton marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance , that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison . opening with j. clarke 's , the king 's march , wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as purcell 's entrada from `` the indian queen , '' j. clark 's the prince of denmark 's march and j. stanley 's trumpet voluntary . fantastic selections from bach , mozart , and haydn follow , with the album also including such delightful listening as the last rose of summer , carnival of venisee , and flight of the bumblebee . you wo n't be disappointed with this purchase
1	it 's impossible to like all of country music , but randy travis is liked by even those who do n't like country music . from 1986 and through the 90 's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts . his calm , nasal drawl reminds me a bit of lefty frizell , but there 's no mistaking his unique style . these are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including digging up bones , forever and ever , amen , too gone too long , is it still over ? , hard rock bottom of your heart etc . randy had 16 no . 1 's on the country charts . there are 20 cuts here . if you only want one cd with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice . by the way , the sound from rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates , neat pixs , and peak positions . you 've got a winner for life with this one !
0	the lady can sing , but her `` christian '' message is compromised because of her part in `` chasing papi '' , where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage . it 's `` crystal clear '' to me that jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part . it 's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee , much in the same way that stacie orrico is now becoming ... ..and is it just me , or is it coincidence that these two womens ' album covers look strikingly similar ? it appears their paths in life are similar , too : compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart . as with a recent review of orrico that i made , i 'll give jaci velasquez her due : she can sing , and what i mean by that is sing the roof off of a house ! this album was excellent ... ..was . now , whenever i think or hear of jaci velasquez , i can only think one word : hypocrite
1	i recently purchased this cd again . i once owned it on cassette . keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early 90 's . if you are building an old school collection with great singers this is a good one to have . it 's great for romance or with that special lady . jaye price beltsville md
1	i went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this cd was released in 1997 , and i identified with every song . i listened to this cd over and over for several months . i saw kim at the `` house of blues '' in hollywood during that time and sang along to every song . this cd is my favorite `` bitter sweet '' cd of all time . i love you , kim
0	gnr were a very overrated band . i found appetite for destruction very dull . this atleast has the band 's 3 great songs in november rain , civil war , and live and let die . get this for 3 great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums ! ! they are not metal !
0	not particularly musical ; only 1 good track ( blues for miles ) ..
0	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy , this cd was very boring . the beats are too similar on every track , and the cd as a whole just has no `` feeling '' to it . if you want to hear him at his best , by 97 octane
1	this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock ! it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again ... . it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time .
0	layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time . cream is one of the most boring bands in history . why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like dire straits , and metallica who rock . ps.this clapton compilation has no good songs so please do n't buy it at all
0	actually garth hudson , the former organist of the band does not play on this cd ( nor 'every geriatric rockstar's ' ) . the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins/messina
0	all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop , its not what ll , rakim , krs-one , kool g rap , ice t , ice cube , nwa , and ( rip ) big and pac , started . we as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album . please do not buy this , this fake rap is got to sto
0	i loved '' careless love `` and saw madeleine live here in rio de janeiro in a reasonably good show.i am quite disappointed with this album however because i had great expectations.let 's face it folks , however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.she needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.this is obvious from seeing her live . so what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight on her vocal delivery ? those songs need an ella , a sarah vaughn , or even a shirley horn -to name some giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range , timing and phrasing . to compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.everything is much too soft and distant ( unlike careless love ) .if you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last shirley horn cds . last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to very minimalist backing chores . i think there is a misconception with the record excecs that m.p . has the qualities to make her a modern pop-jazz diva ala diana krall.she has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.good luck .
1	overdrive , watching the rain , enchanted , teaching myself to dream , glow , lemon , because i can are really excellent songs , this album is really worth it .
0	i do n't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful , with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to . john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he 's doing a ( bad ) imitation of michael crawford in `` hello , dolly . '' he does strange things to his words - i guess he 's trying not to sound british , but why is he singing `` summ-ar weath-ar '' instead of `` summer weather '' ? the ilona is a bass - almost literally . `` i resolve '' has been lowered for her , and yet she still can not master the range of the song . to accomodate her , the second part of `` i do n't know his name '' has a truly odd key change . were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing , but she 's not worth it . the orchestrations are odd , too , with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently . the rest of the singers range from fair ( kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression ) to bad ( mr. maraczek drags down every single note of `` days gone by . '' luckily this is his only song . ) the broadway revival , to my ear , still has the best voices , except , of course , that barbara cook ( the original ) outshines diane fratantoni , who is merely good ( but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout 's original amalia , the annoying judy kuhn . ) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans , or masochists . i 'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of `` you 've got mail '' than listen to this again
1	very interesting cd . some of the vocals are distracting , but the music is driving modern psychadelia . as i said , think syd barrett 's floyd mixed w/ melt bannana . i highly recommend
1	'live etc ' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true gong fans.it features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band 's key albums 'camembert electrique ' , 'flying teapot ' , 'angel 's egg ' and 'you'.taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes ( i assume ) from shows between 1973-75.absolute best cut here is `` where have all the flowers gone ? '' along with `` 6/8 tune '' , that are the disc 's only unreleased material.other cosmic gems include `` dynamite/i am your animal '' , '' isle of everywhere '' , '' oily way '' and `` master builder '' .duration is 78:33.heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record , but the cd simply would n't hold it.talk about wanting to give your fans their money 's worth.long live the mother gong ship ! recommended
1	when a young artist names her first two albums not `` judy '' or `` collins '' but `` a maid of constant sorrow '' and `` golden apples of the sun '' , you know she takes herself seriously.originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all i knew until i saw this cd recently . `` who will buy this ? '' i wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.the comparisons with first two baez albums are inevitable ( some songs were recorded by both ) althought collins shows much more passion and involment where baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.on these early albums collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain ( to some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous `` o daddy be gay '' , a cousin to her `` grandfather '' recorded years later.althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for days , these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks ( voice will soar much higher in the future , she slipped w.b.yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) and as they were product of their greenwich village times , they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.but they are still hauntingly beautiful to me , i waited their re-release for too long
1	much improved voice , same great guitar . slow album , especially on his two remakes . country sound on no reason to cry ( beautiful solo ) . this cd would have been a 6 stars had he mixed in a thunderstorm to the background of gon na rain today
1	sorry , ya just ca n't replace michael hutchence . this is a great overview of all of their greatest hits . i am not a huge fan of greatest hits cds b/c people tend to buy them and , therefore , miss all of the excellent songs that were n't released as singles . all inxs cds are worth buying separately . but , if you must ... ..this will work
1	for the longest time , i have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things : i have believed that the truth could either hurt ( or disturb ) you terribly , or make you laugh so hard , to the point of hysteria -- or a combination of both extremes . there are many things to put this theory to the test , but to cut it all short , all one would need to do ( if by chance it has n't been done already ) is experience the observational humor of richard pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what i am talking about . this classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example . richard pryor has been hailed as a genius by many , and i would have to agree : it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters , but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully , body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well . from the very beginning , to the tail-end of this cd , 1975 's _is it something i said ? _ is a non-stop laugh fest , that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard , i end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process : my throat , my lungs , my sides , my stomach -- they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out . richard 's takes on drugs , sex , race racism , relationships , and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane -- and did i mention hilarious ? the racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what 's referred to as `` cutting-edge '' these days , seem so contrived and unaffecting ; richard 's observations seem just as relevant now -- if not more so -- as they were 30 years ago . i could n't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc -- and there are many -- but i should say that the opening one-two punch of `` eulogy , '' and `` shortage of white people , '' and richard 's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the `` cocaine '' bit get me cracking up so hysterically , i sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick . and again , those are just a few of the many hysterical blasts found here . richard pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason . this album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such . just do n't play it for the kids , and for the love of god *don't* play it during the middle of the night ; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family , and your neighbors . and you know what could happen if you disturb one person 's beauty rest : just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many..
1	this cd is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music . its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing . my favorite track is is n't it romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song . buy it now ! !
1	if you are a fan of oscar peterson this belongs in your collection
0	i am a hater , to the core . i hate puffy and thats all it is to it . now there , you do n't have to say it.so on to the review . first off every lyrical line puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody . every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes . and thats the truth . i do n't know how true this is , but i heard loon was behind most of puffy 's lines on this album . so that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics . the truth is i do n't care who writes his lines . it could be tupac and nas doin it , since its not them spittin it , then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself . almost this entire album is filler . the best tracks is real n**** and journey through my life . i really did n't feel that beat a whole lot but nas and beanie 's verses was off the hook . however that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star . now i love mc lyte and public enemy , but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics . thats not musical artistry , thats butcher work . fake thug dedication really gets under my skin . the title alone . no disrespect to biggie as an artist cause i do like him still . but they put a diss on tupac on life after death after he died , then denied it for years . so perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him , cause thats some sucker s*** . i did n't hear his latest album , i 'm not going to review it , i did n't even visit that section . if you a fan of this guy , then you gon cop this and his new one regardless . if you like me and hate just about everything he puts out , you wo n't be caught within a mile of that s***
1	this is where afi began their sound change from their first 2 cd 's ( answer that stay fashionable , very proud of ya ) . it is much more serious than the first 2 , alot angrier , heavier , darker , and more screaming/yelling as well . some people say this is their best , i disagree , i prefer their `` punkier '' 1st 2 but i still enjoy this alot , it 's all down to personal taste , it gets a 5/5 for me
0	good music but a bad title ! elvis has left the planet but a new king has been born with the self proclaimed new king of rock and roll ken rondell at http : //www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigra
0	someone suggested i listen to this because i was , at the time , into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call `` creatively aggresive '' music . then it was death metal ( which i prefer without cursing or filth , you understand . ) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore . anyway , mr. bungle ... . tepid . uninteresting . bland . stupid . gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over . let them . someone 's got the fuel the economy
0	their basically what would happen if you took p.o.d 's lyrics , and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about god and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice , so you have a band so bad it makes god himself want to commit suicide . the song titles are also annoyingly bad , obviously made so they sound artistically genius ( but instead monotonous ) . and to everyone who thinks these guys are metal , they deserve to be buried alive . metal is fear factory , lamb of god , in flames , and arch enemy . these guys are about as metal as maroon 5 .
0	if you work in a comic book store , live in your mom 's basement , own a lot of black candles , and think that h. p. lovecraft wrote history books , then you might like this garbage . if you have a life , a clue , or a girlfriend , then you probably will not have any use for this stuff . i still ca n't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal . it belongs in a category with sisters of mercy or morrisey . this record is completely lacking any imagination or energy : depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel . i guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast , this would be the thing to listen to . personally i think it 's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour . do n't give these jokers your money .
0	i bought this based on reviews of `` bass queen in the mix . '' to me it sounds like the west coast edition of northern exposure without the 4/4 house beat . in other words , its very electronic sounding , almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all . i listened to `` eargasm '' by plump dj 's and icey 's `` funky breaks '' after this and it 's definitely missing variety , skill in mixing and that `` neck snapping '' funky quality that make the plumps and icey so indispensible . not too bad but not that interesting either . i prefer her `` mixtress '' and still have not heard `` bass queen ... '' btw , my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and i did n't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive . listen to crystal method 's `` phd '' or `` block rockin ' beats '' by chemical brothers after this to see what i mean
1	i bought this for my wife , a huge fan of patrick o'brian ( she 's read the books twice in the past two years alone ) . ironically , it now sits in my car 's cd shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime . i love this music ! as another reviewer mentioned , with some cofee ( killick , there ! ) , this music and desolation island in your hand , you feel transported to a life of long ago . when men sang to rouse the soul , brighten the spirit , damn the enemy and win the heart of their colleen ( sorry ... nancy ) - all with spine , mind and muscle fully intact . the harmonies are rich , the voices deep . and yet , the last reviewer 's questions have the faint ring of truth . my first hearing rang a bit flat , the music sounding just this side of stale . but , in the end , it just do n't signify . even on that first run , by the end of the cd i was clumsily , but merrily joining in with the crew . i suppose i have come to imbue the songs with a life of my own , belting them out at full volume down the highway . i hope you enjoy them as much as i do
1	i rarely write reviews , but i need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is . i have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old , and this cd is in heavy rotation at our house . my husband and i love the music at least as much as they do -- it 's stylish and sets a great mood as we 're making dinner and doing dishes . the kids love it too , needless to say . my four-year-old 's favorites are three blind mice ( she loves when the farmer 's wife squeaks that she 'll give back the tails ) and the final track by peggy lee ( where she says the word *poop* , as in `` party poop '' -- endless laughter ensues ) . ella fitzgerald 's a-tisket , a-tasket and chew , chew your bubblegum are priceless . all in all , i highly recommend this cd -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
0	while i love billie , in her own words , these sessions were dull , and uninspired . since the reviews should focus on one cd , that is the jist of it ; boring renditions , and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection
0	as a peripheral bnl fan , i have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out . with previous releases , i have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings . this cd got stale fast . seems to be geared to the tween crowd . i am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the bnl i have enjoyed in years past
0	i 've seen and heard sheryl live when she 's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs . she 's great - she 's hip , self-assured and kicks butt ! but here , she tells the audience in `` leaving las vegas '' : `` i 'm playing central park tonight ... but i have some friends coming up so can you be patient ... please ? for lil ' ol ' me ? be very patient ... . '' almost begging the audience not to walk out while she 's singing solo . it 's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the `` friends '' arrive . the irony is that sheryl solo is the best part of the album . with the others on board , we ca n't see what sheryl can do , and those familiar with her know that sheryl is capable of a lot . she 's overwhelmed by keith richard , stevie nicks , eric clapton , chrissie hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature . her songs `` it do n't hurt '' and `` there goes the neighborhood '' stand out on the album showing that sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her `` friends . '' too bad she did n't include `` am i getting through '' -- the part 2 of that was a great rock moment . natalie maines ' grating voice ( like fingernails on a chalkboard ) completely ruin `` strong enough . '' chrissie sounds like a zombie on `` if it makes you happy '' , sarah mclaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her lilith-fair mode that she adds nothing to `` a difficult kind '' ... in fact , by the end of the song sarah seems to disappear from the song as sheryl belts it to the end . that 's sheryl 's song and should remain so , tombstone blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of `` all i wan na do '' is the new york audience . happy , white room and gold dust woman are three classic rock standards , so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70 's fm aor radio has heard them ad nauseaum . problem here is that nothing new is added to them , they sound like karaoke versions . despite sheryl 's plea for patience , i was bored with the old-timers.they did n't bring sheryl 's career forward , only backwards
0	understand , i love springsteen . born to run is my second favorite album of all time . i have seen him live over a dozen times . i personally think he is the single most important american rock and roll artist ever ( with apologies to elvis , chuck berry and dylan ) . i even loved nebraska , so do n't tell me it 's an e-street band thing or a rock versus folk thing , but this album is unlistenable . some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful . that 's rubbish . there is a complete absence of melody on this record , as was the case with much of the ghost of tom joad album ( with a huge exception being `` youngstown '' - a great song ) . the apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like woody guthrie or jimmy rodgers is just frightening . dylan could pull it off , bruce just disappoints . but it 's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure . believe , i listened to devil dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what i am apparently missing . i could n't . i thought the rising was a nice album . i even liked the devils dust solo tour ( bruce is a powerful performer , and maybe even more commading when it 's just him on stage ) , but i doubt this cd will ever find its way back into the player
0	great cd . imus in the morning recommended highly and the i-man was not wrong . one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years . i listen to a lot of buffett , james taylor , delbert mcclinton , and this cd places high in these ranks
1	what else can be said about this great cd ? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs . `` child of vision '' is the best ( the piano solo is killer ) of the best , but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end ( no skipping over songs you do n't like ) . a true classic
0	i heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago ( and then for months and months it 's been played nonstop ) . i instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that gwen stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95 % of the song is spent on the chorus `` i ai n't no hollaback girl '' or `` this s*** is bananas '' section . pharell is a master producer and i chuckled because i thought that even the neptunes can produce an occasional flop . to my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer ( maybe even the entire year ) . i do n't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something i 'm missing . like i said you either hate it or love it
0	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds
1	brubeck and desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording . this is sophisticated improv to tame the beast . i have listened to these tracks uncountable times and i never get tired of them . this is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm . try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy afternoon . you wo n't mind the delay . it never fails
0	back 2 da basics *1/2 stars yo gotti has made some decent albums , but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick , gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map , has some good songs here and there , but the rest are just ridiculous , obnioxus and real pretentious . this is not a good album thumbs down
0	this is an endurance test . as in 'bitches brew '' live evil '' love at the fillmore ' latter day miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium . it makes 'jack johnson ' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise . take 'yesternow ' it takes for ever for billy cobham to find a beat . this is just self indulgence of the worse kind , a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers . miles seems to want to create 'moods ' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music . this album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period . mcgaughlin 's guitar though breathtaking in the mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs , totally without any structure and fire ( this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with miles ) disjointed would be too kind a word . when you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were ( i dread to even contemplate ) . miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo 's and is embarassingly weak . maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant , but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess
0	wow , i can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off . 1.- rock and roll part ii ( gary glitter ) and 2.-get it on ( t. rex ) . the rest has been said in the other costumers reviews .
1	i am just writing this review to correct alexander from russia , who cites this album as a christianity peddler . leonard cohen is a jew , who unlike bob dylan ( on john wesley harding ) embraces his sense of jewish heritage and religion within his music . alexander , you 've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly jewish artist and his work
1	i have both the `` heat '' and `` seduction '' cd 's by oscar lopez and listen to both of them with wonder . this man is magic . i have about 20 `` new flaminco '' cd 's and these are right at the top as far as my tastes are concerned . oscar , if you 're listening , i check at least once a month for your next one
0	i cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star . luckily i got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour . i love classic journey , but this band has gone downhill faster than i ever thought possible . most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics . 'arrival ' was pretty mediocre , but this is about 5 steps down from there . granted , steve augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great , but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting . the only way this band will ever create quality new music is if perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band . otherwise , the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years
1	this will be short . it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr. duet carolina shout . that being said , all of the other tracks on this album are excellent . from jungle blues to doug wamble 's solo guitar on autumn lamp , with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden 's art . a must have . branford keeps outdoing himself
1	... yes , the beatles by which i 'm not comparing supergrass to them . no , supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles , but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks , david bowie , the zombies and many others . but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's . this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's , and without doubt represent the bohemia-intellectual-hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa-sgt . pepper . an intoxicating and highly addictive album . 100 % recommended for anyone any age .
0	the singing is terrible on `` fly me to the moon '' . do n't take my word for it . listen to the free sample supplied by amazon.com . at 16 seconds into it , when she sings `` all i worship and adore '' , she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it . the rest of the pieces sound fine
1	i ca n't say enough how great this album is . grant green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet . his soloing on this cd is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to . and for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective . my favorites are `` miss ann 's tempo '' and `` blues for willarene '' . it is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due
0	the 1 star is for this 5 star cd box set being no longer available . does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon ? i have the highlights cd and the `` live at the plugged nickel '' double lp - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling . thank you in advance for any help . scott k fis
1	i ordered mine from here ( amazon marketplace ) a couple weeks ago , and i 'm a very happy camper . this is one of the best online purchases i 've made in a long , long time ! first of all , there are songs i 've never heard before , so by owning this compilation , it helps me get to know the band 's material , or siobhan 's own solo stuff much better . all the songs are very well-written and catchy . thanks to my best friend , he drew me toward 's ss 's music back in the 90 's with the `` hormonally yours '' cd . ss 's music was always something i pushed to the `` back burner '' because i did n't know what to make of it . but in the past 2 years , i 've focused on the new material from the `` shakespears sister # 3 '' album ... and it blew me away ! siobhan is a true musical genius ! `` i do n't care '' seems to be a differnt version . it 's much brighter fresher-sounding than the album version . wow ! `` hello ( turn your radio on ) is my favorite `` ss '' song of all time also appears to be a different version . just hearing the first notes from it , my eyes got all teary . it 's just the way i am , regarding this song . the clock ticking at the end reminds me of a heartbeat or something . dark songs like this draw me near . lol the compilation is missing one song `` bitter pill '' . i wanted hoped for this song to be released on the cd , but unfortunately it did n't make it . awwww ! the liner notes booklet is packed with all lyrics , cool photos and a fine page of background regarding the recordings of their albums . siobhan is one cool gal ! i love the front back artwork , for it is both amusing , colorful dramatic . i 'm a sucker for dramatic stuff like this . hopefully , siobhan will continue recording lots of new material , using the `` shakespears sister '' title . i despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays . hopefully now that sf has released this package , the music will get more airplay . i like the nostalgic aspect of music from a decade ago , because it reminds us of how the music industry used to be non-commercial and fun . yes ... it 's too bad that siobhan and marcella broke up , because their 2 uniquely different voices complimented one another . there has n't been a duo like them since ! my thoughts on the dvd ... i love it ! the first only video clip i 've ever seen from `` ss '' is `` stay '' . totaly blew me away since the first time i saw it . i 've always loved seeing siobhan as `` death '' , in her starry crown black `` glitzy '' outfit . she makes the perfect female version of `` death '' . i could never understand the video until now , because i never had the chance to see the entire thing on tv . the other videos are equally great and draw me closer each time . i appreciate the `` chaptered '' menu for the videos . at least i know what 's from where . the dvd was put together very well , and is packed with great stuff . fortunately , my dvd player on the computer and the tv can play this all-region pal dvd . i have n't experienced any difficulties ( skipping tracks or anything ) . it all plays fine . actually , when i purchased this item online , the item description said `` ntsc format ( usa canada ) ... so that 's why i bought it . it may not apply to everyone 's purchase , though . disc one ( cd ) : 01- you 're history 02- heroine 03- break my heart ( you really ) 04- dirty mind 05- waiting 06- goodbye cruel world 07- stay 08- i do n't care 09- hello ( turn your radio on ) 10- i can drive 11- excuse me john 12- can u wait that long ? 13- do i scare you ? 14- white rabbit 15- was it something i said ? disc two ( dvd ) : 01- break my heart ( you really ) 02- heroine 03- run silent , run deep 04- you 're history 05- dirty mind ( remix ) 06- the russian film ( featuring dirty mind heroine live in leningrad 1988 ) 07- goodbye cruel world 08- stay 09- i do n't care 10- catwoman ( live ) 11- my 16th apology ( edit ) 12- hello ( turn your radio on ) 13- i can drive additional features/info : - biography ( same as on 1st page of linernotes booklet ) - photo gallery with audio ( music ) - credits ( for videos ) - cd total playing time ( 62:03 ) if you 're an `` ss '' fan , this item is a must have ! regardless the price , it 's definitely worth owning ! thank you , amazon , for making this item available through your marketplace
1	del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently ... the beats of songs merge together as tracks change ... el-p makes a cameo ... casual makes a cameo ... prince paul produces a track ... get this album
1	jigga is incredibly hot on this album beanie is good to great . memphis bleek , is really good on this album , but is overshadowed . his `` 534 '' shows how good he is , this album does not . overall as an album it does a good job of showing off roc a fella , but not to much about the dynasty
1	although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys , the pbbb is where the hippy generation , ( this is a couple years pre-san francisco , and before the stones and beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record ) , learned to just play . their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time , and is the single greatest influence on what became the san francisco sound of the late 60 's and early 70 's , ( really long and experimental jamming ) , so this is in fact the `` roots of the roots of the roots '' of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands , mixed-race bands , and , for all practical purposes , the white-blues-man in todays ' world
0	this cd is , without a doubt amazing . stars are lost because prior to recording , you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig . his tone is crushing sounds perfect , but the second he stops playing , every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll . it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once , because it is a chronic problem in every song .
1	i 've been waiting for this one.this disc and this group period was funky.movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period.can you see the light is a tight jam as well.one of the many bad groups from back in the day
0	these songs are hacked up versons of rick 's music . i played it a couple of times until i got the library of original lps . the lps are better . at least they carry full versions of songs . i pass on rick and this package . rca cheats people out of good music..
1	although a couple of reviews said this was a great product , i was wary as i have never found anything that actually worked . i have a job where my mind is always on the go , and often have a week or two a month where i just ca n't get to sleep . the cd arrived during one of these times , i put it on my portable cd player not expecting too much , and almost imediately felt a bit queazy , nothing too bad , and on later research this basically proves the delta wave theory dr. thompson is working . the only time in the past when i have gone to sleep so easily when i have been out partying all night when i was younger . i play the cd on a stereo i have in my room , and i rarely wake up at all . i am certainly going to buy more of his cd 's
1	modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists , ranging from the bizarre and brilliant ( check the lost scrolls of hamarik 's darkly deranged how to find royal jelly ) , to the utterly unforgiveable ( namely , luciano 's appaling attempt at police & amp ; thieves ) . luckily for us , most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category , with great contributions from st. germain ( bouncing dub-disco on a dub experience ) , grant phabao ( updated roots righteousness on andub head yudu ) and boozoo bajou ( with the wonderfully cheesey divers ) . and let 's not overlook cottonbelly 's 90 's classic tempest dub , which resurrects an old scientist tune to spine-tingling effect . only the fairly plain seven dub and the aforementioned luciano really fail to ignite ... all in all then , a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the cd player to skip the occassional duffer
1	in many ways , this album is everything one would have expected -- somehow the natural successor to `` no pussyfooting '' and `` evening star '' . in other ways , its nothing like i would have expected -- the usual stamps of fripp and eno 's recent work seems to be missing . its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material , there 's obvious stuff ( we 'll come to that in a minute ) , but as a rule , the backgrounds could be either of them . sonically , it moves through a number of backdrops , with delicate , percussive , synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ( `` meissa '' , `` lyra '' , `` tarazed '' ) , wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated , the sort of modern fripp soundscapes being more apparent ( `` lupus '' , `` ankaa '' ) . the remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected , the downright funky `` altair '' , with its train shuffling rhythms , drum loops , and funky guitar ( in ways similar to material from the eno/schwaum `` drawn from life '' record ) , and the closer , `` terebellum '' , is an aggressive , haunting , and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of `` radiophonics '' or the other more aggressive soundscapes . over this material , fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone -- its a bit mellower , and rounder though , similar to his leads on `` starless '' and `` the power to believe part ii '' but in a more hushed feel . so that tells not much , the real question is , what 's it like ? largely an ambient affair , the collaboration is what you 'd expect -- there 's no real incindiery moments here -- do n't look for a `` baby 's on fire '' , but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality , and it certainly sounds nothing like crimson . some of it is full of delicate beauty ( `` lyra '' ) , some of its just a blast ( `` altair '' ) , some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ( `` terebellum '' ) . for fans of ambient music , especially the work of these two gentelemen , this one will be quite rewarding . it falls short somehow of being a masterpiece , but it is really a great record . recommended
0	very very dissapointed . e-40 raps too quick , he is too hard to understand and he sounds like a trick
1	not only do you get some great music with this cd , you get the beginnings of climax as well . ( the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on climax records ) includes their 4 hits ( time wont let me , girl in love , respectable help me girl ) and a slew of other very like-minded material . if you like any of their 4 hits , you will love the rest . if you like climax , you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes
1	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago , i listened to a few minutes of it and was like `` what is this crap ? '' and i shelved it for a couple months . i then picked it back up and gave it another listen . to my surprise it was really catchy to me . the music ( and lyrics ) are simple , but thats what i like about them . theyre simple ! this is a great college-rock cd . i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub , and i suggest you do the same . notable tracks are sidewinder , what you do to me , and is this music ?
0	this tribute was announced almost ten years ago , and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then . to be fair , there are some interesting additions such as the sufjan stevens and brad mehldau tracks . and emmylou harris is brilliant . but sarah mclachlan 's `` blue '' has been heard before as has prince 's `` a case of you . '' earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like steely dan and lindsey buckingham . i sure would like to have heard what they would have done . even more disappointing is that joni 's hejira-mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music , in my opinion . as a final indignity , it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase , and hence the overall sound quality of the cd is lacking in dynamics .
0	i love destiny 's child ... but this cd ... big disappointment . the best songs on the entire cd were probably lose my breath , cater 2 u and girl ... big disappointment ... i just wasnt feeling the cd when i bought it..
0	all the cds this band has made suck . not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made . blink-182 , sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk-pop
1	i had first bought the `` here and now '' hoping to hear the original recordings , but was slightly disappointed that on that cd the older songs were live performances only . if you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed , this is the cd for you
0	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music . and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it . kids also like to eat mcdonalds , but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy . there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children . and , surprisingly , a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children , even with the expletives deleted . there is no reason on earth why these records should exist , excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish . i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative . seriously , do n't buy this !
0	this music is a rip off . all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex . something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy . a shame
0	as owner of every single chill/lounge music cd i am aware of , this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time . ultra chill series 1-4 was outstanding . while ultra chill 05 is not a complete disaster , i could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating . quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs . some of the better songs were repeated on older chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs . there is a lot of jazz and latin chill on these two discs , which i also like , but the jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great . i think the person that rated this 5 stars does n't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please . i 'm very dissapointed . maybe this 'genre ' is all dried up ! : ) oh well ... i 'm off to listen to `` chillout seesions 8 '' ... hopefully it will be a lot better . i highly reccomend chillout seesions by ministry of sound . chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding ... time to go listen to the new 8 !
0	whomever decided on putting this box set together must have been smoking crack . since when did 8675309/jenny become a classic rock hit ? are you kidding me ... .come on ! no hendrix , floyd , zeppelin . classic rock my arse
0	the movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack , spend your money elsewher
1	this album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds . the legendary khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the sufi music by playing more with his ( brilliant ) vocal skills then with the lyrics . micheal brooks ' music stands out and enhances the experience further . this is not to say that the mainstream indo-paki audience wo n't enjoy this album ( this is one of my all time favs ) . it is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things ... : ) for those who have been thinking of testing out sufi music , this is the place to start . this is a fine introduction to the great nfak and sufi music .
1	i love this album , the best of phil collins . i believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut . i know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife . he did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well . he is a great composer . too bad most of his new songs ... 2006 , times are different and so is his life , i do not enjoy them as much . once an artist becomes more self-actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory .
0	i read several different on-line reviews for this cd before i purchased it . each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci , that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature . strange . i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her . like my title line to this review states , it 's the exact same music she has always sang , just in a different package . now the cd just collects dust . what a shame
0	even as a joke , this would be horrible ; however , i think this band take it seriously - and it blows ! i picked up this cd because i heard a.r.e . were like a combination of suicide , front 242 , and iron maiden : interesting . no ! ! a.r.e . are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down liars at best . the guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse . example : `` hey world '' begins with how much it sucks to be 13 . when i saw pelican in concert , they were opening ( ? ! ? ! ? ) for a.r.e. , so i decided to give them a second chance . the sound guy must not have liked what he heard , because the bar chatter was louder . `` louder '' i yelled , so that i might find something redeeming in their music . `` yeah , suck louder ! '' someone else yelled - i had to agree give him a high-five . maybe i would have liked this when i was 12 and did n't know any better . zero stars
1	this record is a fine example of earnest juju music . other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards . chief commander obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife . keep in mind , this means amazing percussion work , intertwining guitar lines , loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals . if you 're interested , you should buy it . it will make you happy , no matter how you were feeling , and what you 're doing
1	i recently decided to go through some of my old cds that i have n't listened toin ages . dj cheb i sabbah 's maha maya : shri durga remixed '' was one of those cds that i came upon . this was my first exposure to indian music , let alone world music . i was n't really familiar with music outside of western culture . so this was a new experience for me . listening to `` maha maya '' shri durga remixed '' certainly takes the listener on a trip to india with its traditional indian melodies . i envisioned myself in the taj mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing . the music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me . it is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album . i however dug transglobal underground 's version of `` kese kese '' ( where 's the sarangi mix '' right from the get go . it has a nice beat . dj cheb i sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together . i am definitely curious to hear dj cheb 's other cds now that i have re-discovered this little gem of a cd
0	this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
1	the willie dixon chess set is a window into the early blues that was the basis for some of the most well known rock and roll songs of all time . from led zeppelin to the kinks willie dixon and his music was a source of inspiration and musical reinvention . sometimes you have to stay true to your roots . its an incredible journey into the heart of original blues
0	i heard stories about michelle branch before trying out her music . and i was electrified to find out that there is still a young , honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up . first off all , i 'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners ' opinion , so yup ... criticism is welcomed . i 'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too . basically , my main influences are bon jovi , the goo goo dolls and elo . i 'm a 17-year-old male . hotel paper is one big step for michelle . she evidentally matured her music between `` spirit room '' and this . michelle is pretty much at the state where she ca n't really make big steps on her own . and that 's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream . like the fact that she wrote so many catchy , boring and good-to-sell singles that wo n't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side . although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she can write decent music . ( tuesday morning , drop in the ocean , hotel paper ) some peeps are saying how michelle is n't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist . i agree . imo , many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal . even a noob guitarist like me could tell . but afterall , it 's pop , so that 's inevitable . but she could do much much better than that . her lyrics are ok since she does n't write no emo nor punk junk , but a lot of complaining and childish relationships . most are ok though . what i 'm saying is , she most definetly has her own style ... but sadly , it 's surpressed at an extent where it 's irritating and makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on michelle 's music . nevertheless , just because michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the `` guitar '' , does n't mean you got ta try her music out . but sadly , that 's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted . i believe it 's more about how you like the music . i ca n't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future . but to me , it seems like she 's throwing those away for popularity . one good example is , as prolly you 've already heard ... the posing for a men 's magazine named m -- -- . whatever she was thinking , it really crushed my impressions on michelle ... the cute musical lady she used to be ... .and the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend . michelle is talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists , but let 's get real here ... she has a long way to go . she most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i 'll be listening to her matured and true music . afterall , imo , it 's only the matter of time before she surpasses amanda marshall on my list . i really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to . `` tuesday morning '' 3.5/5 `` hotel paper '' 4/5 the rest are just mediocre
0	do n't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good . traffic ur adagio for strings nyana those songs are just great and the best off the album . but songs like walking on clouds sweet misery love comes again forever today can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though . no song here is annoying in the beginning and i see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for dj tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it . cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff . dj tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 dj i expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying verdict : 2.8 out of 5.0 not bad for the first 20 listens but damn i could have enjoyed it much more
1	undoubtedly , marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann 's best film scores , a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock 's underrated movie . written for small ensemble ( strings , woods , harp and horns ) herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood , tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch . joel mcneely 's reading is simply stunning as ever , so is the performance , but i just do n't like the overall acoustics on these varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details . they simply are overheard in this muffled sound . this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this ! but , it 's a great , great score
1	no other compilation of garland 's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm . all her original soundtrack performances are here , sounding magnificent . far superior to thin-sounding studio re-creations , this is the real deal , assembled with obvious skill , intelligence and dedication to the talented legend . in a sense , this should be the `` soundtrack album '' for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back . do n't pass this up
0	i respect everyone 's opinion in here , and i 've tried so hard to love this album because i love pink floyd and i see how everyone calls it a classic . but i just do not get it . i highly overrated album imo . very childlike and underdeveloped , but maybe that is its charm ? i see 2 very different pink floyds and i have to say i never got into syd 's style . matilda this , lucifer that . the gnome ? come on . astromony domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen i 'm sorry to say . i 'm sure you 'll say a true floyd fan would love this album , well maybe that 's true . but for me , when waters and gilmour were together , that is the true floyd imo . and their reign started with meddle and ended with the wall . a brilliant 6 album run ( meddle , obc , dsotm , wywh , animals , the wall ) . for serious collectors , this is a must have and i 'll give it 2 stars , but stay away if you expect another 'wish you were here ' purchase , pre-gilmour can be a tough listen .
0	i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys . with tweedy 's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris ' departure from the jayhawks , i was hoping we 'd see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris ' `` rainy day music '' was released . now , while there are some really good songs here , nothing really comes close to the `` red-headed stepchilds , '' `` radio kings , '' or `` jennifer save mes . '' the album lacks something but i ca n't put my finger on it . it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus . considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around , drinking beer , and goofing off , this album feels wrong . it does n't have that sing-along feel ( with the exception of possibly one or two songs ) that the first couple albums ( and even ep ) had . just a little lackluster and , considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one , almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throw-aways
0	with much anticipation we awaited the arrival of clay 's second album , thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers ... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career . while clay 's voice still sounds great , the cd is an entire collection of uninspired , underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original . as you can see , this cd is nowhere on the billboard charts , and we 're very sad to say in our household , that it 's for good reason . save your money and buy one of the much better idol cds ... and almost any of them are , most recently kelly pickler and carrie underwood .
0	one word . generic . terrible . boring . ( well , they are all one word ) people must learn to have a better taste in music . granted there is at least one good song . a few others are decent , but only because there are no vocals . if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years , you have heard pulse ultra . my friend likes breaking binjaman ( another uber generic rock band in my book ) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said `` thats enough '' . do yourself a favor and buy a good cd . when will people learn !
0	very disappointing - nothing like riverdance would not recommend and i am avid fa
0	i bought two copies of this sacd , both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly , be forewarned . i dont have any other problems with other sacds so i assume it is in the production somewhere . they would lock up for no reason , this is right out of the box , both copies .
0	i like jennifer lopez , but i am not a fan of j.lo ... let me explain . jennifer started her career in the mid 90s , did some promising work ( selena / out of sight / the cell / blood and wine / etc . ) , and a very well done debut album for an actor ( on the 6 ) . everything was genuinely promising . unfortunately , once `` j.lo '' was born ( circa 2001 ) , her endeavours got weak , too commercial for the sake of money , too fixed only to hype her up , not all that original nor different than anyone else , to truly stand out . `` rebirth '' is an example of that . when i heard get right for the first time , i loved it , i thought it was catchy . it harkened the days of on the 6..that sassy , groovy , r-n-b vibe she had . then i caught step into my world , the only real r-n-b track on the album and thought , i 'm feelin ' it , definitely a favorite to this day . the the rest came along ( 3-11 ) and i thought , sony j.lo made this for the sake of money , due to her films doing poorly , hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album . i thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate . i think she is a great performer , a very talented person , but i honestly do n't feel this album makes her an artist , merely a reworking of herself musically . i rank it 3rd in her album line ... on the 6 ( 4 stars ) j.lo ( 3 stars ) rebirth ( 2 stars ) this is me ... then ( 2 stars )
1	1990 . it dose n't seem like that lond ago . when a barley known mariah carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hase n't been heard since minnie ripperton . she made her appearance when she signed on to columbia records after the now forgotten brenda k. starr , whom mariah was a backup singer for at the time , gave tommy mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history . now about the album . the album starts off with her first single `` vision of love '' a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made mariah a star . you can feel the suspence as mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice . truly to this day , still one of her best songs . `` there 's got to be away '' changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today . this was released as a single in the u.k. ( it was n't released in the u.s. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits ) yet it failed to chart . `` someday '' is the next song and was the albums third single . it too hit number one in 1991 . this song is great to hear after a breakup as mariah warns an ex-lover that `` the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for . '' this song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80 's synth beats . `` i do n't want to cry '' was the albums fourth and , in the u.s. , the last release . it too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt . something that will not be accomplished for a long , long time . though mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product , the song still has all the work of a great mariah song and it is the only song that mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with . `` vanishing '' , though never becoming a single , is probably one of the best mariah recordings . a gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven . though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos `` swiftly you 're vanishing , drifting away . '' it has also been called a `` hidden treasure '' by many reviewers . `` all in your mind '' is another song that realy showcase mariah 's vocal capabilities . though this is one of the few songs that sound dated , but definatly worth a listen . `` alone in love '' is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to mariah . truley a mariah great . the next two songs , '' you need me '' and `` sent up from above , '' really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album . they also sound dated and are not the style in which mariah is famous for . still , every mariah song is worth a listen , so go for it ! `` prisoner '' is a truley a great mariah tune . though this has a rock influence as well , she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head . this almost became a single in the u.s. but mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned . `` love takes time '' truly will have a place in my heart . every time i hear this song it takes me back to 1990 , almost like a little time machine . putting this song on her first record almost did n't happen , as mariah har intended it to be on her next record . though tommy mottola and other executives persuaded her to . the style is not that different than `` vision of love , '' where it build untill the brige where mariah lets off her signature high note . this was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990 . though music box , daydream , and the emancipation of mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of mariah 's best albums , there is no way you can leave this one out . this album truley is the one that started it all . to this date it has gone 9x platinum and made carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from the voice of this generation . though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to paula abdul , janet jackson , and especially whitney houston , it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90 's and of all time . for some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true . this is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple long island girl named mariah carey , who became a superstar .
1	what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd have n't already said . arthur is outrageously talented . it 's almost shocking . the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense . it 's extremely well recorded and mixed music . anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now . `` stumble and pain '' is probably my favourite track . the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb . as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense , layered , and its something he 's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album ! anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption 's son straight after that . what a musician
1	the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time ! if you 're into the whole alt.country thing , you know that some of it is very sincere and serious ( ie , uncle tupelo , jayhawks ) . now i love `` no depression , '' and `` blue earth , '' but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk , or just insurgent country . truth be told , this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant , serious numbers ( rico bell 's `` money to burn , '' the texas rubies ' `` blue diamond mine , '' mike ireland 's `` i 'd like to '' ) , but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously . you 've got andre williams and sally timms singing `` i 'll stick to you like glue ... '' , in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going `` g-l-e-u , glue ! '' you 've got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other 's bodies . you 've got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out `` turn the lights down low , '' which really ought to be a hit it 's so catchy . and you 've got some great deadpan covers -- the waco brothers do a country rave-up of the who 's baba o'riley , '' red star belgrade does it to ac/dc 's `` highway to hell , '' and best of all , the unholy trio turns public enemy 's `` bring the noise '' into an understated redneck anthem . i 'm only scratching the surface here , with 40 tracks over 2 discs . this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on ... and do n't miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation , hell-bent ( insurgent country , volume ii ) -- see my 9/5/04 review
1	edited : it took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since i am used to listening to her recent work - afterglow surfacing . this is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked . in my opinion , this ranks as the 3rd best sarah mclachlan album with # 1 fumbling towards ecstasy , and # 2 afterglow -- even though surfacing outsold these 2 albums . i ca n't say much about the album , because some of the reviews here say what i would say for this album as well . drawn to the rhythm : 5/5 into the fire : 5/5 the path of thorns ( terms ) : 5/5 - first song from solace i heard . truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range . i will not forget you : 5+/5 - love it , my # 1 favorite of all her songs on this album . lost : 4.5/5 ( this is a first for sarah mclachlan to have male background singers singing - edited : actually this would be the third as her 1st album `` touch '' had male bg singers for the tracks trust and strange world ) back door man : 5/5 - i truly enjoy this song , this song sort of reminds me of stupid from afterglow . i love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this . shelter : 5/5 - really sad and it 's actually the second solace song i heard after 'path ' black : 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song . all in all , deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as sarah says . one of her first experimental songs after `` touch '' . home : 5/5 - this is also another good song , probably the 3rd i love . i just love how the song ends . it actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing . mercy : 5/5 - i consider this the last song from the album . wyllh does n't do it for me and i 'm disappointed sarah let arista have it their way . oh well . sarah should do more acapella-like songs ! this truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ; ) overall rating : 9.5/10 outstanding album i wish it had more praise
1	dj quik ( the best producer ever ) did all the tracks in this one with help from robert bacon on some tracks . this album is just classic nuthin more to it !
0	most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this cd is missing lot of songs which define extreme . the implication that it is a `` best of '' and not a `` greatest hits '' should have included more from their self-titled album . tsk-tsk , this does n't include `` mutha ( do n't wan na go to school today ) '' , how can that be
0	simon & amp ; garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music ( most notably for the film the graduate , which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic ) . this cd dates very badly as all thier music does , it 's got a very limited appeal , only for diehard fans , but beware thsi music really sounds dated , i mean it 's really unlistenable
0	i found the music rather annoying . it was not what i expected at all
0	mostly bland , by this time it seemed that bad was dead in the water , nothing here matches the excitement of this is . especially annoying are `sightsee mc ! ' , `ice cool killer ' and `the big v ' . bad goes rap ? no thanks . it 's easy to see why they did the whole bad 2 thing . buy the globe instead
0	i was looking to get the dvd of dazed and confused but got the cd . when it was advertised on the amazon website it led me to believe that it was a dvd as you see it above . ( 1993 film ) i had to return it and my expense . very disappointing transaction with amazon . threfore , i am not impressed
0	( with the possible exception of klemperer 's fidelio . ) i am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message . as mr clinton 's campaign team would say , `` it 's the singing , stupid '' . do *not* be mislead by the starry names , this thing barks and yowls like new year 's eve in the cats-and-dogs home . do not pass go , do not waste $ 35 , go directly to josef krips on decca legends for three discs of perfect joy
1	another solid 70 's band that faded into obscurity . the nice thing about living in canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts . edward bear fell between the two . the original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named winnie . all of their hits are here as well as a cover of `` freedom for the stallion '' , a song that was also covered by `` the hues corporation '' and popularized by `` three dog night '' . its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from `` the last song '' to `` close your eyes '' ( i 'm back again ) . a good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years
1	this album is ridiculous . i almost want to say part of srv 's soul is in this guy ... he is that good . honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two . my hope is that jimmy , dt and apo will bring out a 4th release ... as good as this album or better ! this is one of those great albums where every song is good . buy it . you like srv , buy it . double trouble must have brought part of srv back , because this album is just plain sweet
0	sounds like it should be in a meg ryan romantic comedy . did they intentionally try to erase his personality ? sounds like it was produced in nashville ! this should be a demo for another singer to record . it 's just too schmaltzy for me . i think phil ramone may be slipping too . billy is a much better singer than this . after listening to this song i instinctively lit a match . i 'm going to go listen to glass houses
0	my 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this cd for christmas . it is advertised as the cheetah girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original cheetah girls who are in the movie . the songs just do n't sound the same . it 's very dissappointing that disney does n't tell you this on the cd
0	as others have noted , this was a time of turmoil for the group . now trimmed back to a fourpiece ( they had just lost guitarist/singer bob weston and singer dave walker ) , they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with martin birch on . this cd also leans really heavily on material from bob welch ( this would be his last release with the band ) and it suffers deeply for that . most of the few highlights here are furnished by christine mcvie . the title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication . the understated `` prove your love '' is also a winner . of the welch contributions , the only real standouts are the mystical `` bermuda triangle '' and gentle closer `` safe harbour '' . there are plenty of miscues , filler , and outright bad material here . mcvie 's `` come a little bit closer '' is produced like it wants to be a hit , but it 's much too slight to stick in the memory . welch 's `` she 's changing me '' sounds like chicago colliding with the mac ... the horns do n't work here . the handclap bridge in `` silver heels '' seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune , which is execrable anyway . the silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band 's finest hour just one album later..
1	gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music , and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice . considered by some to be `` hard country '' , i find gene watson to have a more `` pop '' oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs ; and in the '70 's , that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts . while many of the songs on this album are pure country , others are the typical , drab , 70 's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80 's . in any case , there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music , and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today ; including his signature songs `` farewell party '' and `` love in the hot afternoon '' . if you prefer the more traditional country sound , his `` you could know as much about a stranger '' and `` should i come home '' are also included
0	`` modern '' usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the cars , flock of seagulls , or somesuch . it is not a punk record , mostly midtempo pop . the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful ; shelley 's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks . i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff ; newbies should buy `` operator 's manual '' or `` going steady . '' or dig up the amazing `` different kind of tension '' from a used record store somewhere ! also , see them live if you have a chance
0	i agree fully with `` a music fan '' above ... this and david 's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work . i love most of talking heads music but do n't rate remain in light highly like most fans do
0	ignore the big word `` karaoke '' on the cover and the microphone shown , this is just a music cd , it does not display anything in a karaoke player
0	i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd . we were barely able to make it through one listening . this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist ( using the term very loosely ) not already been famous for something besides music . the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling . it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating . i want my money back
0	i am a huge fan of thomas newman but really this cd presents nothing new . it comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy , atmospheric , melody-free cues from his other recent scores . it has none of the originality of american beauty or road to perdition . frankly , as much as i like his scores , i do n't think this warranted a cd release , it 's just got too bland and ordinary , no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds . a pity
0	after really enjoying the amici forever album , i went shopping for another amici album and found this one . there really is no comparison between the two . i 've tried listening to it several times to see if i 'm missing something , but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe . i was very disappointed
0	wow ! tom morello , flea , pete yorn , chris cornell , brad wilk , maynard james keenan . when i first heard of this superstar line-up , i was sure that this cd was going to be awesome . i was duped like everyone else who bought this album . axis of justice ( or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as `` axis of jackasses '' ) is really a bad album , even for a bunch of political liberal rockers . serj and tom really dropped the ball with this one . what could 've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message . knowledge , the night watchmen , and ahmed ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to . the song , '' jeffrey , are you listenng ? '' is up there with other crappy songs like john mayer 's `` city love '' and richard harris ' `` macarthur park . '' on top of all that , the communist entertainer known as michael moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the dvd , which i can say i 've become dumber now that i 've listened to it . for the love of all good music , stay far away from this cd
1	`` burnin ' '' was the last album by the wailers as a collective group , afterwhich peter tosh and bunny wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and marley reformed his group , calling it `` bob marley the wailers '' in 1974 . the album shows the original three at their best , balancing lead vocals on several songs between bob marley , bunny wailer , and peter tosh . the album not only serves to further reveal bob 's soon-to-be legendary work , but also to show the talent of bunny wailer with his lead vocals on songs like `` hallelujah time '' and `` pass it on '' . the album also shows tosh taking lead with marley on `` one foundation '' and alongside marley on `` get up , stand up '' . the album 's biggest gem , however , was `` i shot the sheriff , '' soon to be made a favorite in the u.s. and the u.k. by rock artist eric clapton on his 1974 `` 451 ocean boulevard '' album . the deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in leeds , u.k. just one week before the wailers broke up . ( bunny , however , was already absent , having refused to tour outside of jamaica once and for all earlier that year . his temporary replacement , the wailers ' old vocal coach , joe higgs was also absent , quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the u.s. ) 1973 's `` burnin ' '' shows the original wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere , i can guarentee it
1	i bought this for my kids because i knew they would love these songs just as i did . forget them ! i love it ! there is nothing like the chipmunks and never will be again . the christmas song is worth the price alone . do n't think about it . just get it
1	this is roxys last gasp ... i mean `` wheres eddie jobson ? ? '' actually this really a good recording , its just that the first 5 roxy music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection ... anyway..with that said ... i have no idea why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of angel eyes , which is hard to find on cd . this , to me is really the last roxy music album , because you just cant have roxy music without paul thompson ... sorry . i mean avalon and the others are nice pieces , but they really should have been bryan ferry solo albums because andy and phil are really playing more as session players there
0	i liked the santana - steven tyler song/video . since i found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something i buy within reasonable means - i wont buy the cd . want to make sure that sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson . i have been burned by sony 's proprietary [ ... ] before on other items , so i will stay away .
1	even if you do n't know much about donny hathaway , this collection of songs is a fun mix and it 's very moving . it includes some classics with roberta flack that are terrific . i enjoy it tremendously
1	this is one of my all-time favorite cds . i loved all the songs on this cd except one . my favorite is `` black girl pain '' and it should be an anthem and inspriration for black women all over the globe . i had the pleasure of seeing talib in concert a few months ago in atlanta and his live show was even better than his cd . true hip-hop lives
1	incredible follow up to rated r which i did n't think could be equaled and they did . flat out incredible songwriting , amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best . if you grew up in the 70 's as i did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you . `` go with the flow '' is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you wo n't be skipping any songs on this disc . baby boomers rejoice , rock is back
1	tunisian anouar brahem 's `` le voyage de sahar '' finds him in the same company- pianist francis courturier and accordionist jean-louis martinier- as 2002 's highly acclaimed `` le pas du chat noir . '' having toured in support of that cd , the trio developed into a true group , something that brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble . with `` voyage '' brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly `` jazzy '' as some of his earlier outings . nonetheless , he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid , richly evocative compositions that distill arabic music and european jazz sensibilities with a warm , sonorous chamber music vibe . among the ports of call on this `` voyage '' are `` zarabanda , '' whose elegant lope recalls the french riviera . elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue , while `` cordoba '' and `` ete andalous '' are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope . the gentle bounce of `` nuba '' and introspection of `` les jardins de ziryab '' both include uncredited but effective passages of voice . rarely do you hear music this gorgeous
0	i remember listening to this years ago , and i thought i would add this to my cd library , now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it , , very sqeaky , dull , slow paced stuff , bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
1	spice 1 's just different from every other rapper . and he 's awesome . if you love hardcore rap , you 'll love spice 1
1	i finally got this cd , i have been looking for this cd for awhile now , a great by well worth it
1	this is an amazing cd - i can not believe that more people have not discovered charlie sexton . the songs are personal and beautifully written . the music rocks , and yet it 's different than any of sexton 's other music . he is a brilliant artist and this is a brilliant wor
1	the first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it 's almost impossible to say one is better that the others . taken together , they are almost like one long album . the family that plays together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity . their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first . randy california 's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well . one thing that differd spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert . i saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me . it 's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later ed cassidy/randy california version . not that the later versions of the band were n't great - they just were n't quite as good as the original band . if your'e just being introduced to spirit , the family that plays together is a fine place to start
0	yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse
1	i bought this out of a cut rack for $ 3.99 . it sat in my cd tower for at least 5 years before i ever really listened to it.i could n't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and i came close to trading it.i brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.i really like the whole experience . i 'm lucky i brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but i 'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones . i do n't know anything about this band , i bought it on a whim , but i 'd reccommend this album and i may follow up on this band
1	i love these albums . get all 3 cause they are great
1	i love almost all of these songs on this cd . if you want songs that grab your every emotion ... this cd is for you ! i also recommend their other cds also
0	there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd . i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah , but the rest of the cd left me cold . i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them , it would have been better ! i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy .
0	i had high hopes for this cd . i love norwegian metal , and i love viking stuff so i thought this would be great . i was at least hoping it would be good . what i heard was a bunch of uninspired , mediocre , a dime a dozen metal songs . i mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste , but not enough to give it even 3 stars . the high points are the fate of norns , the persuit of vikings , and arson . these songs are bad @ $ $ and fun to listen too . an ancient sign of coming storm 5.5 just mediocre where death seems to dwell 5.5 very repetitive the fate of norns 7 this one is pretty good . it has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it . the pursuit of vikings 7.5 this is my favorite song from this cd . pretty bad a $ $ . valkyries ride 5.5 tedious monotony the beheading of a king 5.5 same as valkryies arson 7.5 a bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar once sealed in blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer . all in all nothing horrible , and there is some good songs . the music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad . i like a lot of simpler music like darkthrone and burzum . the problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff i like it to have some really good aptmosphere . that is precisly what is lacking here . i will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow .
