0	this is the worst pan i have ever had . we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans . they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap . 1st . the silicone smell was horrible . 2nd . the pan warped in oven . i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd . i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th . the muffins did not come out . i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck . i will never buy silicone anything . do n't waiste your money
0	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me . the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much . i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone . do n't waste your money on it
1	cast iron pans are the way to go . no dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them . this one is probably the best i have ever owned . only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner . bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges . but for pancakes , etc . this is perfect . get this one and a smaller 10 '' pan and you 'll have bases covered .
1	my boxers just love the little balls . they like digging them out of the container even though it did not take very long after they got the hang of it . they carry the balls and container all over the house and yard . it has held up very well . we have had this over a year now , and i only had to stich up maybe 2 of the balls once each . squeekers still work great - have n't needed to replace yet . very happy with this toy
0	the windtunnel ii is a poorly constructed vacuum . it is less than six months old and the motor for the hepa filter had to be replaced . it is very messy when you have to empty the tank . dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank .
1	my cat asked me to submit the following review : `` hi , my name is obadiah , and i am n lim 's cat . he has been feeding me purina cat chow indoor formula for over a year . i must say that this is excellent cat food and tastes good . before purina came out with the indoor formula , i was getting the regular purina cat chow and always had an overweight problem . weighing over 15 lbs , i never went outside and slept most of the day . this sedentary lifestyle caused some concern with my veterinarian , who said i should be down to about 12 lbs . then , i started on the indoor formula and lost those three pounds . i am lighter on my paws and can still be just as lazy as i want to be .
0	large burner failed after about 12 months use . i opened it up the wire between the plug and the resistor had burned . not only is it broken , it is a fire hazard . i lost all the paperwork that came with it and i probably voided the warranty by opening it . i think i can fix it but i am not going to risk a fire , so i will try another brand
0	i was not pleased with this griddle at all . after reading the positive reviews , i ordered it . maybe mine was defective , but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them . it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher . oh well . ca n't win them all
1	here i have a refurbished palinato x3 ; textured , very hardy stainless ; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws , -170 to start ( 6 mo warranty ) . but let me correct one point made in these reviews , the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic , a rather new trend that works quite well , the steam nob as well seems to be this material . all around this is quite an improvement on the x1 : more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1 . cups warm quicker also . it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better . still it 's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder , and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming , fat content just makes more fat , not true foamed milk .
1	not to be bought if you want to hatch alot of baby brine shrimp ... but great if you want to hatch an occasional snack for your fish or to have around if the power goes out . nifty , easy to use product
0	we have owned this machine for a little over two years . for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying . however , since then , it has stopped drying , such that 5 hours of drying ( yes , 5 hours ) yields wet clothes . this has persisted , despite 4 repairs , replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board , which i assume is next . prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer/dryer combo which was a disaster : that broke after 3 years . unfortunately , the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines ( equator , asko , maber and other brands ) available in the us..all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless-condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v . the bosch combos available in europe , but unfortunately not available in the us , are 220v and thus , dry more quickly . this is not a machine for a family , but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most . when it worked , it worked well . however , no one should invest $ 1300 to have it break in such a short time . and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry . if you must purchase one of these machines ( for reasons of space ) , buy an extended warranty
1	i purchased 2 of these perforated pizza pans and they are perfect for baking pizza , also , i found them great for baking breads and other items as well . i would reccomend this product to anyone that bakes they are easy to clean up and can store very easy .
1	i received this as a christmas gift . i 've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane . i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles . i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you 're flying . it 's the best way i 've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere
1	the delonghi heater is light weight , has multiple settings , safety knock-over switch , thermostat and a remote . i have moved it room to room and it has worked wonderfully . the price was reasonable . i would buy it again . this is a good brand
0	this percolator is not worth the price . the coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot . i returned mine and purchased the farberware fcp512s 12-cup cordless percolator . i love it !
1	i have really nice dansk everyday dishes , but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use . i have to admit , these dishes are really stylish ! they look great on the table , are very lightweight , stack very compactly and are a nice large size . the only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls . they are small , and while they look really cool , the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around . if you 're looking for bigger bowls for cereal , you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that corelle makes . for salads , the square ones work just fine . a word of pricing caution : on amazon at this moment they are $ 69 a set . i bought mine for $ 49 per set at my local walmart
0	i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil , but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle . you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out , but that 's not true . any time the temperature rises , the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout . when the temperature drops , air enters the spout . this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen . if you do n't use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid . if you use cheap olive oil ( and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil -- even the extra virgin ) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils , but it will still happen . i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again . ( i learned this lesson the hard way . ) a better option , though less elegant , is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap , or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it
1	this is the fourth piece of furntiure i have bought from this line ( mission , natural ) . i love it . i have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center , but use them as night-stands . it fits my 1950 's contemporary home perfectly . price is great . delivery even better . i ordered on a saturday night and received it by tuesday noon . i could n't ask for more .
0	i prefer my spoons to stand upright . many of my spoons fall out of this one , i guess it depends on your shape of the spoon
0	i bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture . what a waste of my time and effort
1	absolutely fab ! ! ! shiny-bright stainless steel , matches frieling french press , and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly ! just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so ... of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you 'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers . overall these are just very sturdy/solid , clean-up beautifully and very easily , and , by the way , the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar , and sets inside the little 'notched ' area of the lower bowl , so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple , yet european-engineered , well-thought out design quality . i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down ... although it 's a l-o-o-o-ng time until i 'll be distributing my assets ! make sure to buy the matching frieling french press- it 's just incredible , also heirloom quality ! give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware- it 's one of life 's simple , yet indispensible indulgences ! ps the frieling french coffee press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too
1	we have total enjoyed the margaritaville maker . we have discovered many normal drinks taste great when you mix them in this blender . if you are into the creamy ( i.e . baileys ... ) drinks they are lighter and more enjoyable . we are very happy we purchased this
1	i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills , i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews , so i bought it . i really love it . it heats up pretty quickly , and has enough space for 2-3 people 4 people would have to eat slower , but it does have enough broiler space , and its square to have people at all 4 sides . we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal . the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say . most of it comes off very easily , but some spots of cooked grease remain , it comes of with some elbow grease , and a scrubby , but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was
1	i absolutely adore these kyocera knives , they are the sharpest things i have ever seen . i ordered this through witbecks , and the first one got lost in the mail -- that can always happen . when i contacted matt witbeck he responded immediately ( that night , from home ) and the next day sent me a replacement . i have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service , and so i want to recommend witbecks to anyone
1	ice bucket is smaller than i expected . otherwise , a very good product
0	neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well . it takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount . perhaps the blades that crunch the s are not sharp enough ? very disappointed in product
0	in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems . my main beef is it 's too hard to clean . a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up . it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank . soaking in vinegar does n't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled . the ( phosporic-acid based ) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing . and there 's the hitch ! you ca n't reach parts of the element , not even with a toothbrush . why they could n't center it just a little further away from the edge of the `` wall '' is beyond my comprehension . i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart trying various methods of cleaning than with it running . i would n't buy it again
0	i got these knives as a gift . ironically , the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped `` stainless steel '' . let 's be realistic . these knives are cheap . they 're thin and they 're not well weighted . however , they say stainless steel , and you figure that that 's what you 're getting . i hand-washed these knives and dried them immediately , but they still corroded . now comes the bad part . i wrote to their customer service department twice and did n't hear back . i finally got their address ( from the post office ) and sent them back the knives . it took three months of me emailing and calling them ( with 15+ minute wait times for each call ) to get them to send me a replacement set . the replacement set rusted in about two weeks . that was in september . i just got off the phone with miracle blade , a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say `` i 'm going to finish my sentence '' so their rep would stop talking . they wo n't refund my money . in fact , they wo n't refund anyone 's money after 30 days . the lifetime warranty is for replacement only . they 'll send me another set of soon-to-be-rusty knives , of course -- if i pay the shipping and handling ... again . i asked the rep for his full name , for his id # , and for a manager , and he refused all requests . in summary , if you buy these knives , they will rust . you will want to get rid of them . your only option will be the garbage can
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc
0	i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine . none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one . initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots do n't line up just right the mug will not work . i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently . stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation
0	received this as a gift and i must say i 'm very disappointed . at its highest setting it takes forever to toast . the other issue is that if you buy any bread with `` non-standard '' width ( like home-made , gourmet breads ) it wo n't fit into the toaster
1	i bought these for christmas presents for a few people - and they loved them ! they were an incredible deal , warm , and appropriately sized . they were so great that now i want to go back to get some for myself . colors were great too
0	i bought it some time ago for much less , also from amazon . it is not worth $ 24.00 . may be $ 6.9
1	after 3 -1/2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day , and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk , this little steam toy still works like new . better than new , actually , because it has a better operator . good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction . i 've come home many times to discover that i 'd left the electric switch on all day , but not to fear , the thing does n't burn up , so far . on other occasions , i 've overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water . the pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle . this will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir . when it happens , just start over with dry coffee . you will also need to buy a small diameter tamper - mine is 49mm . the expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me , even when using cheap brands of dark roast like eight o clock and community coffee . everything i 've said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent , howver , on the coffee grinder . without a good grinder , you might as well just make drip coffee . the secret good expresso , in my experience , is 25 % expresso machine and 75 % grinder . a good grinder is the gaggia , which i bought from amazon for $ 175 with a discount , or the rancillio rocky , which i would have gotten in the first place had i understood the importance of an excellent grinder . this machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you 're on a road trip , and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning . my next expresso machine will be much more expensive , but not because i 'm trying to obtain a higher quality brew . my only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve , which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta-filter . also , when you get familiar with the operation of a machine , you 'd like it to last so you do n't have to learn a new set of techniques
1	i very much like this sommlier glass but they are quite fragile . a significantly better choice for everyday use is the schott zwiesel diva line of glasses . granted , the riedel glass is thinner at the rim but man , for my dollar , the schott glasses are a steal
0	i bought this for my mother-in-law at her request . she has arthritis and saw it on tv . she also wanted the free gripper that came with it . i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper , even paid a little more for it . she used the can opener once and it broke . the `` free '' gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s fee
0	bought this set at target 3 years ago for $ 200 , and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them . they 're heavy , cooked things well , and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool . never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil ( metal , etc ) in them that did n't belong in them . took care when washing , did n't burn things in them , etc . somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months , and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement . because i did n't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set , and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating , they had to go straight to the trash . very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life , with high care and high cost . the 2nd star is because they are beautiful and i cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these , they might work for you . for me , stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go . i would n't even try another `` non-stick finish ''
0	this dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb . when it closes , it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side
1	the picture in the ad does n't do these pots and pans justice . they are very very shining and heat evenly and fast
1	have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers , london broil , steaks . it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use . the cooking grate can only be set at two levels : standing on its posts or inverted , lying on the rim of the firebox . the level must be chosen before you start cooking , which presents a problem for some preparations . the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature . emptying ash is a bit awkward , as you need to remove the doors and coal grate , then lift and tip the firebox , which is heavy . the lip catches some ash , so it is difficult to completely empty . be sure to set the grill on a pan , as grease will leak through and collect around the legs
0	evidently the people at krups did n't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market . the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in . it scrapes the lid every time . they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer ? you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee . you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe . also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups . i 'm sure this is the last krup 's product i will buy .
1	i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter . it appears to be a little on the thin side , but is very warm . i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it . the pillow shams are only standard instead of king . very good price too . ! ! ! !
1	i was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price . i was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion . this set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand . although this set comes with a sharpener , i recommend getting the wüsthof 2904 knife-life knife and scissor sharpener . you will not need to sharpen these knives much , but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house . i also recommend , as others have , to never place these knives in the dishwasher . also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use . this will drastically increase their longevity . if you purchase these , and i propose you do so , then get a travel roll bag for knives . this is because you will want to take them to friends ' and family 's homes to `` show them off ''
0	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof . the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me . it is a very frustrating mug to drink from . the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot .
0	this container is way too small to keep any fish in , let alone two . in such a small container , the fishes ' wastes will build up quickly , causing eye and skin irritation , sickness , even death . you can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently , but not only is this a lot of work for you , it is stressful for the fish . in addition , if you want to keep bettas in a divided tank , there should be decorations for the fish to hide behind when they need a break from flaring at each other . this tank is too small to allow that , another source of stress . thirdly , bettas are tropical fish . they need a tank heated to a constant 80f . it is not possible to safely heat a tank that is smaller than 5 gallons . if you want to get bettas , please read some of the excellent websites available and learn all you can about their care . if you can not afford a proper tank , please do n't get a fish
0	i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed . the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box . the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings . the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o-ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position . the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate . the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier . the design defects are so major that the person ( s ) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired ! the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink . because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still can not completely fill the water container to the top . the screw-on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright . the next design defect is that one can not at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container . one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance , but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night . the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just `` drop into place '' on the base . one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position/angle of the water container to get it to seat properly . this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time . i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service . i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features . however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier . i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second , not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier . thus i returned the 6011i humidifier
1	keeps the tank warm for my little fish friend
1	this pillow holds the heart shape better than i expected from some of the other reviews . we have been careful so that it does not burst because of others warnings about the mess . still my daughter has made good use of this pillow and still sleeps with it every night
1	i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity , cost and excellent coffee - this has all three ! the first two or three times i tried this the coffee did n't come out that good , either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent . i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day . the other good news ... i 've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker - it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress .
1	i have two of these , one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color . they 're attractive , of course ; this is fiestaware , after all . but they 're darn functional . they 're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs , and they 're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you 're carrying or serving . i like wish there was one slightly bigger too ; then i 'd get two more
1	we bought this canister set to compliment the stoneware we purchased from the same set . i am especially impressed with the seal used on these canisters . you would swear it is mechanical ; the lids open easily , yet seal tight when simply placing the lid on the canister . they are very high quality and look much better than the stainless steel ones we were considering before finding these . recommended
1	i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps . currently , they 're working on chewing up the shelves . so i 'm off to buy one that 's entirely wire . wish i had done that in the first place
1	i 've been wanting a knife sharpener for decades but just could n't justify spending over one hundred dollars on one when , wa la , i discovered the wusthof 2904 model on amazon ! it 's so easy to use and , while the scissor sharpener does take some practice , it 's wonderful to have useable kitchen shears and regular scissors once again ! sheryl , california
0	my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now . we found it to be a great machine for the price . others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands , so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums . now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on . this thing is lite , strong , and easy to empty . the cord retractor is a little lite so i would n't be to rough with it . garrett and susan
0	the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use . i would get the furminator instead , it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove
1	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier . it works really well .
1	i use this in my 29 gallon , and the filter is excellent . the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in . it is also very quiet . however , when the power goes out and comes back on , it wo n't begin working again . you must add water to it to get it up and running . this has been a problem when i 've gone on vacation and i 've come home to cloudy water . the refills are also pretty expensive , and can get a bit messy . it 's all worth it , though . it keeps my tank in nice condition . :
1	i just bought 2 of these tables to use as nightstands . i have a very high bed , and thought they would be too short and too small ... but they are perfect ! i love the extra storage at the bottom , and the little drawer is very useful as well . assembly took no time at all , and the tables turned out extremely sturdy . i am very pleased !
1	after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time , this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf , with an interesting pattern on the crust . my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly . it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf , and much more rustic/natural than using a loaf pan . the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old-fashioned way . when it 's done rising , carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven . the loaves look and taste great
0	walnut tradition kitchen scissors ( asin : b00005am7r ) do not have `` comfortable wood handles secured with triple-brass rivets '' , they have unattractive chocolate-brown plastic handles . the bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature , and simply get in the way .
0	i purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old 's room . he has a 19 inch tv/vcr/dvd combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a `` 20 inch '' tv . if you have a modern tv with speakers on the side it will not fit ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the item directly from step2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item ! ! ! !
0	i 'm terribly disappointed . the feed chute is tiny ( barely big enough for two fingers ) , the tray above the chute does n't hold anything ( most things fall out ) , clean-up is a nightmare , and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice . stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 , unless you enjoy torturing yourself
0	unless you love the look of this pepper grinder , i 'd suggest you look elsewhere . when compared to a generic grinder , this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds . i 've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them . with this grinder you 'll always get a huge variation in the grind . some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish . the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable , you 'll have trouble turning it . not recommended
0	i find it more than a bit ridiculous that pur charges 40 dollars for their product and 20 - 25 dollars for their replacement filters . i have owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use . why ? because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time . tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse . removing and reinstalling the unit does not help . i have become so frustrated by pur water products that i will never again purchase anything made by them . i just installed a brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit . do yourself a favor and avoid this over-priced piece of junk at all costs
1	great product at a great price . the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item . thank you
0	my lab mix had the rope detached from the tennis ball material in less than 20 minutes . in the same time , she 'd broken some of the individual strands of the nylon rope , so if one thing had n't broken something else would have . not durable , not recommended
1	not much to be said about this product . just watch for a low price and then stock up
0	3 cups ? i do n't know where this teeny thing would equal that- not even 3 demitasse/espresso cups . amazon really should make the 'see larger image ' say 'see life size ' ( try it ) ... or better yet show something for scale- like 10 coffee beans- the amount it holds . so , i 'm already kinda down on this liliputian trinket and i check instructions to see if i can heat the water in the microwave- like i do with my other 'real size ' french press ( without the top ) . no , nothing saying that should be a problem ... 2 minutes later the rubber bottom mat is burning furiously in my microwave ! i 'd hope hugo had a 'bonjour ' because i certainly didn't..
1	we love this crate for our pug , but she is a smart little dog . she has learned how to get the zipper on the end undone and escape . of course , when she does this no one is home and we find small gifts left behind
0	this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent . description stated `` standard classic white goose down feather pillow '' . a more accurate description would have been `` mostly feather pillow with some goose down , skimpily filled '' . i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate ; i.e . larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order . vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content , as they did with other catalog items . i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was . caveat emptor
1	we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it ... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky . our daughter now has it and is happy with it . we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid . the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up , making things a bit easier . the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump ... it 's a little too fast for what i want , most of the time . another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter
1	i wish that i had purchased the sheet set earlier so that i could have enjoyed them all winter , they are so comfortable , even with flannel pj 's i did n't have any problem turning over . i completely recommend this sheet .
1	simple , straight forward to use . very easy to clean . and durable . ca n't beat it for the price . better than any drip
0	i did not buy the whole set . my review is for an 8 '' fry pan . it was one of those `` try it '' deals . i do not like the grooves in the pan because after , for instance , frying an egg , the grooves retain food and if you do n't use a brush to scrub the grooves you 'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves . i ca n't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware . yikes
0	you can hold this in both hands and your finger will only overlap a little . 18 oz 's is a lot of water
0	i 've had this coffeemaker for two weeks . i bought it because i had an old mr. coffee that worked fine , but was white and stained . i liked that this was black and looked sleek . the very second time i used it , the off button stuck , so you can no longer turn off the machine , but have to wait for it to turn itself off . also , every pot has grounds in it . i 'm using the filters that came with it , and have never even filled it to capacity , and i ca n't figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee . piece of junk . do n't buy it
1	i like it very much . kettle is in a good working condition and it looks good in a kitchen with all stainless steel appliances . i would recomend to purchase this kettle as a good quality item .
1	i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet , which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz . it does a reasonable job cleaning , transforming my carpet from `` does she ever vacuum ? '' to `` oh , she must have vacuumed yesterday '' . it does n't get all the fuzz and crumbs , but it does what i 'd expect from a sweeper . it is also much lighter than my vacuum , so i 'm much more likely to use it . my three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too . she insists on sweeping her own room ( i wo n't complain ) . the main thing i 've learned is that , because the handle slides together , it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head . this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle , the sweeper will probably fall off , so pick it up near the sweeper . ( it stays together fine when actually sweeping .
0	i am a very experienced user of innova . innova is i guess you can say is the parent company of ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware . innova is not know for quality and this product is no different . there is a 25 year warranty on the ultrex , i had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off . you can return the product for another but yes , you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized , you have to pay ups or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge . the customer service is not world class . i had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement . the workmanship is horrible , the product is made in china , however , i 've had other things made in china that were of great quality , so i do n't know what is up with innova . i suggest that if you find a product made by innova , avoid it ! save yourself the aggrevation ! this product does n't deserve 1 star
0	loses grip on can and the can slips off ... bad product . do not buy
0	the knife is constructed well - as pictured - does not cut very well . it just was not very sharp . i tried mincing some vegetables - it just did n't work as well as my $ 9.99 serrated tv info knife . i was disappointed
0	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold . there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through . i grate a lot of cheese , and i am sorry i bought this grater
1	i 've had this for over a month and i 've only made grilled chicken with squash and asparagus . if you do n't marinate your meat it will get really dry . easy to clean , most of the time..
0	the pump broke within 2 weeks and i have n't been able to find a replacement . it would be under warranty but i threw away the paperwork ( my bad ) because usually i keep everything and then it just clutters up and i never have a problem . however , i still think the product should last a little longer than that ! i purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although i had tossed the box , etc
0	unfortunately , there is no option for 0 star . i had the same problem as lana from nc . i ordered the product , and when i opened the box , i found that i received only the bottom piece . when i asked if the remaining pieces could be shipped , i was told that partial products are not shipped and that i would have to get an entirely new order . fine , other than i have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one . except , if they do n't ship partial products , then why did i receive a partial product to begin with ? i received the second , mind you the replacement order , and the same exact thing happened - i received only the bottom piece . so now i have to shlep both packages to the post office and waste my time for their error . i suggest doing a search of metrokane cocktail shaker and you will find a couple other sites selling the same product . one site even has 2 different sizes if anyone is looking for a smaller shaker
1	just a word of advice : if your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up . if they are n't , it probably is not the toy for your dog . at first , my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy . it took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was `` his '' . once i finally got him used to realizing it was his own , he saw me put his kibble in it . then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it . granted , the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy 's value . now , it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes . he 'll do anything for treats . although , i 'm not sure that he really , really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears . i think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats . i like interactive toys : ) on the other hand , our little dog , still does n't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy . just a guess , he probably never will figure it out . so , some dogs will take to it , and others will look at you like you 're crazy for giving them a toy that does n't squeak
1	pros : towels are good in quality . absorb water very well . decent in length . soft . cons : have lint coming off when trying to wipe wet skin . still need to put it through a wash to see if it leeches colour
1	i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved , but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years . i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one , the pampered chef one works better than this one . however , this is not a horrible product . one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you ca n't see through this one to see how high the oil level is . you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway , and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it wo n't work as well . this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level , it almost wo n't spray if the level is too low . but since you ca n't see through it , even holding it up to the light , you have to look down in and estimate how high it is . the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is . you do n't want to fill it all the way up , either . then , you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped . this one sprays a very fine spray , finer than the pampered chef one . and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there . i think i know why my old one got clogged . so i 'm trying something new : each time i 'm done , before i put it away , i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure . i think if you leave it pressured up all the time , like i did with my old one , it damages the nozzle over time . but time will tell if i 'm right . another tip -- do n't fill it with anything but olive oil . other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer . you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot , you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it . olive oil does n't do that , that 's why i now do n't use anything else on my stovetop ( except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying ) . this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it , trust me . but if you have a choice , go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer . it 's cheaper and better quality
1	i needed a canister vacuum that was n't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors . this vacuum worked out well . all we had was an upright and it just did n't cut it for our floors . this turned out to be a good product for the price
0	having had a hoover in the past , i was excited to find this one at this price . i 've had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again - and will not be looking at hoovers . the parts are plastic and cheap and break easily . it advertised a power hand tool . it is not . it works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning . the upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months . the hard wood floor tool worked fine - and suction was strong enough - but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments do n't stay on like they should , so i spend most of my time with the vacuum re-attaching the pieces . i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last
0	this item did not work when i got it . i returned it to zelco , who informed me that it was my error , they did not do refunds , and returned it to me . i had a previous model zelco that worked great for 10-15 years . it had a switch . this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off . gr
1	over the years i 've tried a good dozen humidifiers . worries about bacteria , difficulty in filling up , and difficulty in operation led me to trash them all . i now have two u7142 himidifiers . the control system is extraordinary ; you can set desired humidity , fan speed , and time to run . there is preheater ( to 40c ) that helps kill the bad stuff and use of silver ( do n't understand it but assume it works . ) to kill more bad stuff . liked the first so much i bought a second
1	this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi , which , i thought , was decent . well ... after using this for 3 weeks , i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent . the titanium is a wonderful machine . not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great . it 's fully programable and , once set , it 's just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso - every time ! it warms up in under a minute , has a large bean hopper , large water resevior , very cool blue lcd display ... i ca n't rave enough . i 've had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes . i really wish i 'd kept my old ones , even though they were black . the size of these is nice for flour , sugar , etc . ; however , the rubber seals in them are n't great . the seal on my flour ( biggest one ) falls in every single time i take the lid off . they 're pretty , but not very functional
0	sigh . was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces . i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's warning . doh ! oh well . live and learn . live and learn . refund , please
0	this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it , but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months -- it would work one day and then not work the next . whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today . no matter what the features an appliance has , that rates an automatic 1-star in my book
0	this vacuum worked the first time i used it , but that was the only time . with the amount of noise it makes , you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor . however , what it appears to be doing is using its rotating bristles to redistribute the dirt in a thinner more homogenous layer . if you are looking for a machine to use as a sound effect prop for a jet engine , this is the one for you
1	the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase . however , i gave it another chance . the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great . my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make . to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out , i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it
0	saw the other review and had to share my similar experience . the glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing . it 's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings . i have to return it because i know will get angry every time i pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess
0	it did the job til it became defective . after a year of light use ( avg 3 times a week ) , three of the most important buttons stopped working : the start button , power level button and minute plus button . now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button .
0	the only good thing which occurred when i bought this item from amazon was it arrived with in two days . i was quite disappointed when i opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper i could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run i ended up paying more for it . i wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed . this hamper lacks a lid so i reccomend if you 're looking for the same thing not to buy it . if i had known it lacked a lid i would not have purchased the hamper . it 's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product . i gave it two stars because it 's still functional and sturdy
0	although the press has a timer , i found that it does not operate as expected . it does not seem to reset quickly after opening , so i ended up timing myself . i like that it can be stored on it 's side
0	i loved this while it worked . this worked great for the first 2 times we used it . after that it would n't work . it has a 6 month warranty so i am in the process of getting if fixed .
0	these covers are not even close to being red . the are wine or burgundy in color
1	put these next to the riedel glasses and they show very nicely considering they are half the price
0	worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed . i 'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it 's impossible to make a waffle that does n't stick completely to the waffle iron . a complete waste of money
1	my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40 . my wife and i limit their exposure when we can . an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye . recently , they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle . we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers . the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me . i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job , but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive , requiring rotation of the trays . i immediately sent it back to amazon . thats when i ordered this nesco unit . it is powerful , and effective . i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers . i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them . order this and you ca n't go wrong
0	i have used tendskin since college and while i ca n't say that i like it , it does work . my girlfriend introduced me to the min solution2 and i gave it a try . it works much better and i think the roller ball applicator is genius ! it smells really clean too and a bit minty .
0	my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends ... .his bedroom was decorated with thomas ... .but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for $ 3.99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch ... . i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding ! i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block-out light ... .because i opened- package the other set i send back to amazon . i do not recommend this product ... .and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy ! ! ! ... .i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block-out light
1	i have had many different kinds of wine openers ... screwpull , rabbits etc ... and nothing compares to the ease of this cork pop ! i have the `` legacy '' version . nice looking and takes less than 10 seconds to remove the foil and open the bottle ... no kidding ( okay ... i have n't really timed it ... ) . this would be great for someone with arthritic hands as there is no pulling or tugging involved ... not even to remove the cork from the opener ... just twist and the cork is removed . it is really the most amazing opener ever ! the only downside i can think of is you will have to have cartridge refills eventually ... i received mine about a month ago and have opened about 15 bottles of wine and still have plenty of `` juice '' left in the cartridge . awesome
1	this is the best way to clean a grill . i use one each time that i clean the grill . this is a must buy . it is a great idea
0	did not work right out of the box . the heating elements did not get hot . so i had to return it otherwise i would be throwing money away . do not buy
1	we bought this waffle maker because the american ones are hard to find . and this one got great reviews . so given that we prefer american waffles to belgian waffles , we still like this waffle maker ok . very easy to clean , and definitely non-stick
0	the scale does not come with a battery , even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging . scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it . all of this i can live with , the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself . when turned on , it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds . i timed it -40g for one minute ( and after hours ... just keep on going ... ) . the box had no signs of damage , so i 'm guessing the load cell was bad . very disappointing .
1	i literally received the order 1 day after placing it . thank you
0	i love water filters , this perhaps is my third , first was a brita , gave to family member years ago and it is still in use , went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers , then to this ultra . this pitcher leaks , i suspect it is the style , leak is not big-time , but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items . i am not happy . elain
0	the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't ! this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt . what a useless thing . i 'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor . this thing certainly does n't do it ! if you 're looking to buy this thing , look again -- there must be something better if not just your regular broom
1	a little disappointing . we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we 've had for umpteen years and still works like new . we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment . the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced . we 've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it
1	they worked so well . we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year . it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees . we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails . the mojito 's were a hit . we set up a `` mojito education station '' on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video , then we had a station set up with mint , sugar , rum , lime wedes , ice and soda water . this muddle was an excellent purchase . it did the job efficiently and well . even mojito novices got the hang of it easily . great buy and good luc
1	these are good quality sheets . they are a bit narrow compared to what i 'm used to . i 've used them everyday for about 2 months now , and there are no scratches and they clean up super easy still
0	does n't whistle as it is supposed to , handle get 's very hot ( i have a gas stove )
1	my husband loves cereal for breakfast , and i bought it so he does n't have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal . it was a perfect fit for him , and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses . i was surprised at how big it was , but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful . the rubber turn knob does n't jam up as easily as i expected , although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense . only complaints : 1 . the top plastic covers are not completely airtight , but are fine for dry cereal . 2 . the bottom rubber covers fall out easily - they should fit more snugly
0	i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months , even cut through chicken bones . but just like the other reviews , the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment . i used these for making chicken soup alot , but noticed that it also does n't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful . so the next set i get i 'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time
1	this mattress pad is plush , soft and comfortable . washed it recently for the first time and the quality held very well . fits the mattress nicely and does n't move around .
0	i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still have n't received this . i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now wo n't get it until june 30th . costumer service is ridiculous , i was told it would take 3-5 days that 's why i ordered it . don't get it , if you need it within one yea
1	my husband was skeptical , why do you need a new $ 200 pot he said . well i bought the dutch oven , with two days of receiving it i made the best beef stew he has ever had . he said the meat was much more tender than when i make the stew in a crock pot . never again will he question me when i say i need a kitchen tool
1	i like this winged corkscrew but i had to repair the plastic once when the cap near the wings busted off . superglue did the job , and i have n't had trouble since
0	it 's fairly cheap looking , but it does the job . the razor holders can not hold my gillette mach iii turbo razor , it slips out
0	i returned this item because it was too big for the brother es2000 sewing machine i bought . it was very bulky and took up way too much room . the machine rattled inside the case and slipped around . it would probably be better for a larger machine
1	this is a high quality pan , with a nice heavy weight to it - not at all flimsy . i wanted to get one like my mom 's , and this turned out to be less expensive , but a much better quality and heavier weight . i bought 2 of these , along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon 's 4 for 3 promotion , and it only came to about $ 30 ! that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality . i would absolutely recommend these
1	this is a great gift because there fun , cute , and usefull so when you come home from a bad day at school or work there alaways there.to me there like a special friend that you can cuddle.so for kids and adults this is a must have
1	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up . i use mine constantly , and did n't think i would when i bought it . we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own . i love my fiestaware , you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes
1	this is the best book light ever . my only issue is the battery life , but i fall asleep and leave it on all night sometimes . the pages are illuminated very well and it 's easy to use . makes a great book mark , too . do n't let what i said about the batteries influence you not to buy . i have both sizes . i 'm rough on them and i 've had no problems .
1	i am very pleased with the chemire dinnerware set . it is very durable and the colors are great . the dishes are larger than i had expected . they are a little heavy due to the size and thickness . i would recommend them to others
0	we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much . it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese . this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it wo n't work . unfortunately , because it 's rigid , it slides up a dog 's neck very easily . i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it ca n't slide . even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides , it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position . a shrug , a shake , or simply walking a few steps is all it takes . this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs , is not going to work . it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight , it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member , this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems . the dog now has another negative association to the person . consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying . f. quall
1	i have purchased other syrup dispensers in the past , and all of them broke . usually the thumb lever jams with dried syrup . this one is a unique design that appears to prevent this problem . and , it even comes with an extra o-ring : -
0	the pitcher is made from poor quality materials . we have two pitchers and have never washed them in the dishwasher . in less than a year , both pitchers cracked along the seam that runs from the spout down the side of the pitcher . if we attempt to use them , tea immediately leaks all over the counter . since other pitchers are not compatible with the machine , our ice tea maker is useless . we have owned two previous mr. coffee ice tea models in the past ten years . the pitchers lasted for several years before eventually cracking . mr. coffee chose to use inferior materials with this model . i am very disappointed in the quality and will never trust their company again . i am now searching for an ice tea maker that uses quality materials
1	the my pod and its filters work great in my senseo . now i do n't have to buy the expensive pods all the time . the only problem is i have to shut it off manually as it wo n't sense it is full and shut itself off .
0	this product does not work . the dial just moves randomly . please tell me who to contact for a refund
1	i almost did n't purchase these because of the reviews , but my son likes thomas , so i did . i was expecting really rough , but i do n't think they are all that bad . maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material . anyway , the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly .
0	has to be seasoned just about everytime before use . overwise , great pan
0	although this item 's description says it is made of `` commercial quality stainless steel '' it arrived with several rust spots ; so much for whatever `` commercial quality stainless steel '' means . also , be aware that the handles are not round , but are `` u '' shaped . it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush . on the positive side , the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips . however , on the whole , i would not recommend these locking tongs .
0	the hoover floormate was great the first two times we used it . along with the old english it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution . after using it twice , it had difficulty dispensing solution from the reservoir . this was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly . it still got the job done . not too long after that it would n't vacuum the solution back into the unit . i got a great clean for the price divided by four uses . you do the math . i 'll stick to the `` cheap '' clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after i put the floor ex-mate into the trash . very disappointe
0	get a couple of good hones instead and learn to use them . i got one of these a couple of years ago . i figured i would now enter `` easy sharp knife heaven '' , but it ruined all my knives . they are sharp , but only kind of sharp . it ground the bevels to flat and i never managed to get anything that was remotely razor sharp , and trust me , i have tried . anyhone who says razor sharp , does n't really mean razor razor sharp or may never have seen a really sharp knife . if it is n't as sharp as that scalpel you used in biology class , it is not razor sharp . i recently bought the book razor edge sharpening , and a couple of razor edge hones and hand reground all the knives i had ruined ( does n't take long if you do it right , even form a destroyed edge ) . now i finally have the ultra scalpel sharp knives i always wanted . so sharp it is almost scary . good hones are n't cheap either , but you can use them for your other tools too , like chisels , etc
0	this was a horrible egg slicer . i thought something from kitchenaid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile , but was i wrong . worked fine for eggs , but broke on the first strawberry . my previous one broke on the first mushroom ! do n't bother . use a knife . save the slicer for the eggs
1	i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant ! if you do n't use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain - this will spoil you . it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it does n't drip on anything . and the whole thing is dishwasher safe . i paid more than $ 9.95 for mine too
1	we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago . it has held up so well , that i just purchased ten more place settings ( the friday only sale ) to use for entertaining . our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day . this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold , ( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from ) . the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions .

0	i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best . only problem is that they rust ! ! ! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior . i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times . the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic . i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money did n't last long at all . i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i 'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided . much smaller than anticipated , i can only fit a tablespoon in it
0	i really loved the look of the lamp , and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair . two days after i bought it , it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole . i returned it , and actually considered getting another one just because i liked the looks of it so well , but ended up just getting a refund . i was pretty disappointed , and am still looking for a lamp to replace it
0	i purchased this fry pan in june of this year - and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st . i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all-clad , but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer , and a small fraction of the cost . after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick ! i love the uncoated all-clad , but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future
0	there is n't much to like about these sheets . they wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired - hanging threads are all over the place . i would not recommend these sheets at all
0	we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning ( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher ) . after the third use , the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base . delonghi service was apologetic , and promised to send a replacement part asap , although the part was out of stock . that was in september , almost 6 months ago . parts are still backordered ! i returned the unit to lowes in frustration , got a new unit , and it too melted on the first use . returned it for credit . do not consider this unit .
0	i have been searching for a baster with an injector . this one looked good . it works ok with the injector but it does not work at all as a regular baster . i guess i will keep searching
1	i recently purchased this double boiler and i am very happy with it . it is a good quality stainless and that is important . i love the `` vintage '' style , it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape , much like one that grandma had many years ago . the boiler insert is 6 '' deep , not counting the lid , and perfect for making frosting , candy , custard , anything that requires gentle cooking .
0	heavy machine , looked durable , almost commercial . put her together and began . within 5 minutes of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated ! returned it the following day and bought a bissel that has worked great , was cheaper and weighs less !
1	i have used this for treaditional recipies as well as with different ethnic twists..korean bbq , seafood , italian roasted peppers , artichokes , etc.we have used potatoes bread for topping with goodies..the possibilites are truely endless.. the grill is easy set up , and easy clean up..very family friendly
1	the product is everything as described plus . it stores alot of laundry , and wheels easy
1	these pans are great , they are very sturdy and good quality . do n't buy anything else ! trust me
0	after 6 weeks of waiting , customer service said it was going to be another 3 weeks ! forget it ! cancelled order
1	we love this item , it 's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them . they look cute in the kitchen too !
1	purples are most of the time hard to match , not with the fiestaware plum sugar packet caddy . the color matched just perfectly and all i could do is smile
0	i loved these sheets when i first received them and would have written a glowing review then . however , now that i have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled . they look terrible but i have n't slept on them yet since they pilled so i do n't know how that will feel . hopefully it wo n't be noticeable . no one sees these sheets other than me and my husband , but i am very disappointed with these considering i 've had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that have n't reacted this way . by the way , i ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want . maybe it 's possible that certain colors pill and some do n't ? i have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also
0	i 'd think if i were dyson , i would recall all of these . big , bulky pricey , and worthless . i thought turbines were designed to spin ? it certainly does not compare to the vacuum at all . bought a real one for $ 17 ( shiping included ) eureka power paw , dyson should be ashamed
0	after remodelling our kitchen , i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out . when i saw the picture of the towel holder , i thought it unique with its scroll-work and would n't look like everything else i saw . when i received it , the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible . i tried with no luck to remove the stains . the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all , i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship
1	i like a big mug of coffee , and the senseo coffee maker just does not have that much room under the spout . my tall mugs do n't fit , but these do perfectly . just a note for fellow senseo lovers
1	i 'm certainly glad to have this pointer . you 'd never know it is inexpensive , since it looks quite sleek ( like a fountain pen , though heavier , for sure ) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance . pleasantly sensitive to the touch , it needs no fussing . you 'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model
1	what a fabulous pillow and a great deal . they looked small until i unpacked them , then poof ! big fluffy pillows ! nice
1	by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non-stick pans . it 's already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches . it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface .
0	item worked for one year , three weeks . then had widely varing temperature readings , or indications that the oven had reached over maximum temperature ( 500+ degrees ) when oven was set for 325 degrees .
1	my parents live in florida , so we got two of these and rechargable batteries for use in case of storms and power outages . the fan is very quiet when operating . i like the fact that it runs on batteries - great addition to the `` hurricane survival kit '' !
0	i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers . i did not succeed . i paid $ 50 and could have bought a $ 20 mr. coffee and saved myself a lot of my money . this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features ... . it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features . it has no clock , no timer , no automatic turnoff ( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off . it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back . it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles . you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing . in a word , `` do n't '' . it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element . and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee . i am not an engineer , just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go . this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace . if you want a basic coffeemaker , get a mr. coffee for $ 20 , this is not what you are looking for . there is nothing `` deluxe '' about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me .
0	i bought this sheet set , the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel , and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son . he , too , loves star wars ... and as i read the other reviews , im nodding my head . these sheets feel like burlap ! i have washed them regularly since december ... with no improvement . they dont fade , though..which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 % polyester and only 30 % cotton . very stiff and scratchy
0	hopefully , i will never make this kind of mistake
1	it 's a very secure for children . my daughter is happy with this produc
1	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it . the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable . clean up is a breeze . i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces .
0	the sewing machine , is built very cheaply , does not even sew correctly , i understand i didnot pay that much , but to feel you really are just ripping people off , its an item i ended up throwing out , for it just took up space
0	worst product ever ... do n't know how it passed through initial testing . when you turn the crank to dispense cereal , it crushes it and sprays it all over the room . awful , just awful . too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash . waste of money and space . and we tried dog food , which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck . really made me angry that i wasted the money . false advertising .
1	a great quality french press that made bodum famous . simple , easy to clean and quick ! ideal for the times when you need a nice cup of fresh brew coffee but could n't find a coffee maker nearby .
0	this is horrible at keeping coffee hot . it gets cold quick . buy another brand . i bought this model and a larger zojirushi 1.9 liter stainless steel model at the same time . they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch . the 1.9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button . also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen . it stains instantly and for ever . i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic . but something has happened over the last 10 years , their quality has really gotten bad
0	i also have this fountian in black . i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part . i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty . the filters do not seem to last very long either . i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke . now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one . i do not reccommend this color at all ! the fountian has been fine until now , but it should n't of broke down already
0	i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time . however , as other reviewers noted , almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day . i was n't intending to use the delay feature very often so i did n't bother to return it . now , just short of a year after i received it , it suddenly started working , so i 'm shopping for a replacement . i might try another mr. coffee model with better reviews , but not this one
0	i 'm looking for a timer . simple as can be . i should have listened to the previous reviews . this thing simply did not work right out of the box . it would `` catch '' at the 20 minute mark and just get stuck there . great . i would definitely not recommend this product
0	corrected review : on september 1st , after using it five times to stir soft ice cream , i used this spatula to stir flour into oil and it broke with the steel stem sticking out . amazon emailed the promise to refund this product but i have n't seen the refund yet .
0	table came with chipped wood on one leg . when put together , the chip got even worse . the table is horribly unsteady . would not recommend to anyone .
0	first item came with the lcd display scratched under the protective film from the factory . yes from the factory . put a battery and it ran for exactly 15 seconds and died . tried a new battery , different brand etc . yup , dead . do n't buy this thing , i 've never seen worse quality in my life
1	i bought these for a wonderful craft . i was expecting them to be decent , but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were . if i realized how nice they were , then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping . i realize that i got 100 bags , but my craft took about 75 of them . they are nicer than the piping/icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating . when these are gone , i will definitely order more . the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out .
1	eeks mice are great ! most catnip mice lose their flavor/smell/attraction for my cats pretty quickly , but my cats still play with an eeks i 've had for over a year . the one drawback is that they do n't look too good after being played with ( teeth marks , drool stains , ripped-off tails , etc ) , but cats do n't care about that
0	well after reading the reviews of this vacuum , i decided to give it a try . i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth . right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i did n't like . i thought i 'd give it some time though and hoped i could adjust . here is what i found : 1 . the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated . 2 . worse than the vacuum being heavy , the darn thing is really hard to push . even on hard smooth surfaces it 's hard to push . i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag . for it to drag on hard surfaces , it must be a design flaw . 3 . the on/off power switch is foot operated . not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage . on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush . while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch . i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i could n't find it by looking down . it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off . unfortunately , the damage was done . the belt snapped . how nice . i really liked that . first time out and the belt snapped . another note about the switch ; there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off . it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off . the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up . couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it 's a real challenge . maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes . hey dirt devil here is an idea . how about putting the on/off switch on the push handle . what a novel idea . doh ! 4 . the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy . it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose . the main reason being is that the hose it too short . it 's like you are fighting the hose all the time . it gets tiring . 5 . the detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it 's port . you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat . 6 . the vacuum is terrible on rugs , on any of the floor height settings . it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby . my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it would n't get all caught up . i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it . it jammed up every time . 7 . the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors . it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back . i have to use the hose attachment . 8 . the vacuum is horrible on steps . with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position . easy deal . the dirt devil does not work that way . when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good . the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted . one little problem with that . the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking . you do n't get a good positive suction . so , you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal . the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position . it often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth . it 's a joke . the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush . the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum , and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt . if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops . now for pros : 1 . the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean . it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up . it almost makes my carpet look like new , and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister . some vacuums like to just tear up carpets . 2 . the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding . all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed . i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else . i ca n't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies . maybe i 'll be lucky and the motor will die soon . then i 'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil . steve
0	i just got this thing 2 hours ago . in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working . made it through about 8oz ... try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot , nope . number one , this is nothing more than a typical small `` hand held '' grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing . do not buy this . the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing
1	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect . it has no `` auto turn on '' feature , but i never use that anyway . the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens , but it soon becomes habit . my favorite feature has to be the water filter . it really improves the coffee flavor . it 's also compact . i gained a little more counter space
1	i am extremely pleased with the anolon cookware set . it cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully . many of my friends recommended this set and i 'm glad to have taken their advice and made the purchase
0	i grind beans for my coffee every morning . i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder ... sold the old grinder in a garage sale . i do regret buying this grinder . it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 . my main complaint is that it is messy . the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out . i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it . also , coffee grounds are everywhere , i always have to use a cloth to clean up . not a good buy
1	perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who do n't like their food all running together on your plate . good for snacks like pudding and jello . also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side ~ nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing . plus it wo n't take up alot of space on your table . this is a very nice color
1	look . i suck at using a normal iron . but , after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners . the results are pretty good . as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better . plus , there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others . i just did a couple of long-sleeve dress shirts and the results were good . not perfect , but good . as others have said , i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with . but , once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge is n't really a big deal . more height clearance would be nice , though . it wo n't be too long before it pays for itself . and , now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled ! plus , i 'm pressing my golf shirts which typically did n't look that good after being washed , but were too expensive to get dry cleaned ... i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun . now that was an easy shirt to iron . :
1	i 've always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for : 1 . keeps the beverage hot for hours . 2 . when sealed , it does not leak at all . 3 . easy to drink from and dribble-free . 4 . suitable for right and left hand drinkers . 5 . fits into most car cup holders . 6 . clips to straps/loops/handles to carry easily , even when filled . 7 . easy to clean and stays stain/smell free . 8 . rubber accents provide non-slip grips and does n't make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table . 9 . high quality construction for durability . 10 . it looks really cool ! this mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug . i look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug . finally , a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user . this is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price
1	this sharpner worked so well that i bought a second one to have when i wear this one out
1	this pan is a good example of calphalon quality and the design is very versatile . start a saute on the stove , add ingredients , then put it in the oven for a quick roast or broil . i am also planning to use this to roast pork and chicken in the oven . the metal handles stay suprisingly cool , i have only had to use a potholder when getting it out of the oven . i hate washing dishes , but this pan cleans like a dream . the only thing i do n't like about it is the high price
0	we have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our ford windstar van . this cushion did not help
0	the larger of the bowls was broken when i recieved it so it was not packet very well . i have used the smaller bowl and loved it .
1	i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it . now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner . this is a gaget worth having . my husband even loves it . it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze . it gets plenty of use and it still going strong . it is very user friendly and so easy to empty .
1	rapid , efficient , sturdy and easy to clean . must to attached to the edge of a counter and the right edge was hard to find . i hand pitted cherries for 90 minutes and completed the same number in 15 minutes with the cherry pitter
1	i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages . i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances . the item itself works pretty good for the most part . the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it . to remedy the issue , i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place . i 'm not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate . perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find . i used search terms like `` mini trash can , '' counter top trash can , '' `` small waste basket , '' small stainless steel trash can , '' but none of these got me to this item . i 'm not sure how my husband finally found it .
1	what people do n't think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug . i 'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it . i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there , which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross . especially water . who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face ? not me . not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything . it smells good and i ca n't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some . a great mug you should buy .
0	this grill pan heats relatively evenly , and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread , allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously . it leaves nice `` grill marks '' on the food , and works well overall . the press that comes with it is very nice to have , as it helps cook food faster . however , it has one major drawback : it makes a very odd smell when it is used , regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated . i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses , but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box . it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product . i have a number of higher end calphalon non-stick pans and none of them make this smell , making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan . bottom line : if i had to do it over again , i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead
0	these 'vino grande chardonnay ' glasses are less in volume and shorter in height than the spiegeleau stemware previously sold under the same name .
0	if you want your wife mad at you buy this vacumn . a total waste of money and time ! ! ! poor suction , air filter is clogging constantly , filthy when you have to empty it , shuts down when it picked up a small piece of paper , have to unplug for 30 minutes . they lost their marbles when they designed this vacumn ! could not even give this thing one star , it is that bad ! ! !
1	i bought one of these for my girlfriend ... then read the reviews ! in my opinion it appears to work fairly well . the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage . to the far left seems to work best for 'normal ' walking . as i said , in terms of accuracy , i think it 's pretty good . the radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5 ' stars . the sound is `` tinny '' ; it 's not stereo ; there 's no frequency disply ; and the 'super-mini ' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones ( earbuds ) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size ! though overall , when comparing price to features ... this little fella will probably suit your needs . if you already have a walkman ( or do n't care about audio ) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet
0	we 've had this for about five years . the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery . the battery is soldered to the circuit board ! they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $ 20 each way ! i opened it up , cut out the old battery , and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months . cooks rice great , though
1	it is n't exaclty what i expected . but it works . it looks nice . and holds a lot of coats and does n't tip over . it serves its purpose . are there better quality coat racks ? yes . but for this price , its worth it
1	i found this same item at a target store in stock for only $ 39.99 . they also have it for sale on-line for the same price . it 's a great chair
0	poor quality , the cover leaks , i had to return it back , do not buy
0	this coffeemaker 's design is flawed . but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i 've received from any company in years . they sent their new thermal carafe model , which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of . give them a chance to make it right . customer service is part of the equation with any purchase , and mr. coffee/sunbeam has impressed me on that score
0	a collegue of mine raved about it -- she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office . i tried it for a day , but was not convinced either way . then , i bought the largest model , and tried it at home . i used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the `` acid test '' . i used it in the toilet room , closed the door , and let it sit there for 8 hours . when i inspected the room , i could still smell what i smelled 8 hours earlier . and i so wanted it to work ! the other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose , but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor ( as does a hepa air filter )
0	i was cooking 5 strips of bacon on the platter in the microwave and the platter actually cracked in half ! i have cooked bacon on my other platters with no problem . this is dangerous and annoying . i could n't find sango customer service anywhere , therefore , had to return to retailer , etc .
1	we bought this pad for our 2 year-old son 's twin bed and it was so nice that we later purchased one for our queen sized bed . it is soft and does n't crinkle and make noise like other pads we 've had . it also washes in the machine really well . we 've washed my son 's once a week since we bought it ( about 6 months ) and it has n't changed a bit , still appears to be in great condition . both the twin and the queen fit our mattresses well
1	the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised . it has three nested work bowls . the inner , smallest one takes a special blade ( a smaller version of the standard processor blade ) . it 's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things . pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something . the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest , 12 cup bowl . a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box ( finally , a way to keep everything together ) . the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl . it 's the kind with the rotating hub ( two hub sizes are included , one for lemons and a larger one for oranges , etc ) . while it seems to work , it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker , but what the heck , it 's worth trying . the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it . at first i was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking about it , you only need the provided on , off and pulse . would i buy it again ? absolutely . would i buy it again from amazon ? again , absolutely . the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised
0	reasons : 1 . faulty battery cover design . the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface . 2 . the protective glass is cloudy - making the timer numbers hard to see . 3 . the alarms are not very audible . 4 . the magnet `` unglued '' itself within the first three days of use
0	we received our sheet set and they felt like sateen , but when we washed them they lost the sateen feel . they feel like flannel . we are very disappointed with our purchase
1	i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than $ 5 . same concept , just a lot cheaper ! two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen . the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they 're holding . i 'm sure it 's pinhole sized if you 're hanging something that weighs a few ounces ( in which case , you do n't need this - use a pushpin ! ) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized , but it is a heavy shelf . the hole is still way smaller than the hole i 'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf . it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks ( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang . ) this is a small detail , but if you need two of these things and you do n't do it right , your object is gon na be crooked . but on the bright side , you wo n't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it ! recommended product ( but look around for the knockoffs .
0	we love the omega paw litter boxes to death , but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box . our cats do n't like the paw cleaning side , they refused to walk on it . so we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter , but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor . we leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those , but our new boxes are doing fine without them . the cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves . you might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws , but do n't buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it
0	very bad quality , not worth to buy it . it is not as good as the picture . do n't buy it ! !
1	i am very pleased with my new salad spinner . it can hold a large amount of salad , which means i do not have to reload and do the work over and over . the mechanism is easy to use and works smoothly . i am also able to soak the salad in icewater in it , and then drain it and spin , all in the same piece of equipment .
1	this knife along w/the matching 7 '' 5-star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb , prime rib , ham , veal , turkey , etc ... at various carving stations at my job . i love the 5-star line have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife . i 'd recomend trying the 4-star pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line ( same blades , different handles ) . i 'd definately replace if lost/stolen . after using proper tools there 's no way you can go back to cheap knives . i 'd love to see a 12 '' version of this knife w/a wider blade
1	this cute little casserole is great for making soups or casseroles for 2-4 people . i use it for my morning oatmeal , soup for lunch and casseroles for dinner . retains heat so foods stay warm.clean up is a breeze ! i have the green pepper but want the red and yellow one too
0	this thing basically self destructed the first week . the handle pieces would n't stay together and when i pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart . not worth the money ! i was very disappointed
0	i bought two of these humidifiers . one for work and one for home . they both broke in the first week
1	the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets ! they are excellent quality
1	i purchased the ic70 ice crusher for my father for christmas who eats ice all day long . he loves it and pleased with its performance . i used it myself a couple of times and like it as well . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants crushed ice
0	when i bought these pads at amazon last year , a 50-pack was $ 11.99 -- now its $ 26.99 ! does anyone know why this happened ? the pads themselves are fine and work beautifully with the pad holder , but i 'm protesting against this price
1	this was the first item that i purchased on amazon . item was received in excellent condition , and in a very timely manner . very pleased
0	i 'm a betta hobbist and i know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus . this `` aquarium '' is way too small , betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1-2x weekly atleast . this is probably 1/2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day , t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills . this also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring , no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just is n't good . you can also buy large critter carriers ( 2-3 gallons ) for the same price or less , it would n't be great , but it 'd be a heck of a lot better
0	i say nearly useless because the ceramic pot is a nice size and weight for melting chocolate in the microwave ( which is what you 'll have to do ) , and the warmer makes a decent trivet ... but , it does not ever get hot enough to actually melt the chocolate . we followed the directions , and allwed 1/2 hour for the chocolate to melt ( putting chips in as we started dinner ) . half an hour later , some of the chocolate ( on the outside of the crock , by the burner coil ) had melted a bit . an hour passed ... still nothing much . now , given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature ( which is why it is used in cosmetics ) , that 's saying something . the pot never reached 98 degrees ! if i 'd put the chips in a zip-lock in my lap during dinner i would have had better results . since this was a relatively inexpensive item , and i got it effectively for free during amazon 's recent valentine 's day promotion , i did not send it back ( thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy ) ... but , if you are actually paying for this- do n't bother . ( or at least be advised that it will not actually melt the chocolate ) . it does do a reasonable job of holding the temperature once you 've melted the chocolate some other way .
1	used for a month now , better than the others tried over 25+ yrs . for the remanufactured price , would buy it again if it lasts for a yr
1	this cooks bacon crisp without any mess or spatter . just place a couple of paper towels over the bacon . i was using my george foreman grill , but this is easier to clean
1	my boss wanted extra seating in my office for visitors . we ordered online but were a little worried . this loveseat was delivered very quickly , assembled in minutes and is so comfortable that my boss has decided to keep it in his office ! now i have to wait for another one - good thing it only takes a few days
1	yep , i had some 20-year-old revere ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem . and the lid from the pan fit the steamer . it 's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes , and probably more . exactly what i needed and the price was good too
1	i 'm please with my coat rack . i have several heavy jackets on it and it 's sturdy as well as attractive . i would recommend it , especially at the price
0	we 've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it 's ok but nothing special . it does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed , nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality
1	heats well and quiet . does not blow heat very forcefully but certainly warms sufficiently given enough time using the oscillation function . appears solidly built with good warranty
1	saw a demo of this at a local sur la table and very impressed . the coffee it makes is outstanding . i plan to buy one later this year . amazon is being deceptive about price . they state list price is $ 2400 , and they 're selling it for $ 1798.95 , at a savings of $ 601.05 . not ! look at the jura-capresso website . the list for the impressa f9 is $ 1799 . that brings amazon 's big discount down to a whole $ 0.05 . the higher end impressa s9 is $ 2399 ( and amazon claims it is $ 3200 ) . do your research . do n't trust amazon 's claims for msrp
0	ditto the other 's observations ... the thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room ... i had the thing in a 63 degree room , had it set to 85 degrees . it would register 90 after 30 seconds of running , turn off , slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period , and then repeat . the temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees ... .
0	looks great in my kitchen but i , too , only use it for shakes smoothies . it does smell like burning rubber nearly every time . i used to think something was wrong with it and now i just disregard it . and after less than two years or making smoothies , i 'm replacing the blade gasket assembly .
1	when i first saw this dehumidifier i could n't stop laughing . this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed ? i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better ( bigger ) dehumidifier . i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little-bitty sucked up an inch of water ... in one night ! ! ! now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem . the free shipping was a great plus as well ! !
0	the writeup is incorrect . this does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers , it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200 . while returning it is not difficult through amazon , it means a trip to ups and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement
0	i 'm a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover 's delight . it turned out to be my biggest nightmare . it takes a lot to set it up and get it started . if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place , boy what a mess . it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy . took up way to much room on my counter . i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good , if not better . it 's small , easy to run , and the coffee tastes great . deb in new hampshir
0	i followed the instructions , many times , but still ca n't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle . the oster wine opener cork-screw goes in just fine . however , instead of pulling out the cork , the cork-screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork . i 'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis . well , maybe i have a `` lemon '' but i certainly would love someone from oster tell me is i 'm doing something wrong . thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone 's attentio
0	i tried this thermal coffee press - delighted to see it was 1/2 the price of other thermal coffee presses - but in this instant you get what you pay for 1 ) the coffee does n't stay as hot as a regular thermos 2 ) when you press the grains down to the bottom they leak back up into the thermos and your last cup of coffee looks and taste like mud 3 ) its these times that you wish you bought the item in the store because now i have to pack it back in its box and send it back
0	poor carafe design makes this mr. coffee machine a waste of money . we bought this model to replace our old mr. coffe machine after we broke the carafe and could n't purchase a replacement for that model . we loved our old mr. coffee , but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because , as other reviewers have noted , it 's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee/water everywere . after the first few uses , we decided to purchase a different coffee maker
1	i bought one of these in august of this year . i used it daily to make a ham/egg/cheese/english muffin sandwich every morning with great results . however , after about a month , the non-stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan . i called back to basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days . the new pan has been in use for two months without issue . the people at back to basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle . some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice . others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and/or sticking in the pan . i have overcome these problems by doing the following : i bought a gallon of distilled water that i use in the water compartment ( at an ounce or two per use , a gallon will last a long time ) . this prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum ( keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum , therefore speeding cooking time ) . every three or four uses , i wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down . after cooking everything , i remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork , tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water , then remove the egg with the plastic fork . i use store-brand spray oil and have never had an egg 'stick ' in the pan . i have found that if i want toast/an english muffin/a bagel to be pretty crispy , i have to run it for two toaster cycles . all in all this is a great product . butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically , and i 'm not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning . plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day .
0	first off , i paid $ 25.00 for this at walmart , so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum . at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for $ 54.00 . secondly , it works fine for the amt of money i spent . thirdly , my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it , i will have to put ear plugs in . seriously , this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm ! ! i have an email in to eureka.com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to
0	the detector was simple enough to use , although it required alot of batteries ( 8 ) . but the results were mixed . urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances . even in areas where i knew there had been an accident , it was difficult to spot the difference . all in all , i generally would n't recommend this . ( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom . )
0	i bought this pan and to my suprise i had to assemble the handles on the skillet and the lid . the handles on the skillet were not bad at all but the lid ... . anyway , after i got it assembled , wash , and dried per the instruction manual i plugged it in a began cooking . it was amazing-my chicken came out beautiful ! two days later i was cooking and the thing went out on me ! it became cool to the touch . i left it alone for a while thinking maybe i did something wrong-but i was already cooking at a low temperature . it did not come back on when i replugged it in . hence i had to give it back . i was so disappointed . i am just glad it did not happen while cooking the feast i had planned for the following week . save your mone
0	the unit is hefty and nice looking but that is about all nice i can say about it . the grind was no better than from the $ 20 burr mill it was replacing . on the third use the motor burned up . i also had problems with it making a mess when removing the jar -- such a defect should never have left the factory since it is so obvious
0	this juicer is extremely heavy , made of industrial type metal parts , but it 's poorly machined and assembled . the heavy parts do n't fit together well , and the juicer is wobbly and unstable , despite it 's heaviness . i am sending this back without using it once , becuase there 's no way to adjust the parts , and it 's too unstable to use as is . also , it really is almost impossible to pick up and move , due to the weight , without straining your back . finally , like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer , i find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant , and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places . it seem like the kind of company where to get a good product , you 'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one
1	superior product , great tasting expresso ( rivals starbucks ) , and very reliable . i have owned the granos for about 6 months and have found it to be a pleasure . it is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso . the style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests . if you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte , i ca n't recommend the granos more highly . i plan to buy another for my office
1	i bought this sauce pan last week . the quality is very good . the handle design is quite comfortable . i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan . i found no hot spot . it responded to the change in the heat setting is average . it 's kind of heavier than all-clad ltd for the same size of pan . i 'm not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet . for the initial impression , this calphalon one non-stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all-clad - ltd , stainless steel , mc2 . look for the bargain . it 's worth the cost
0	it seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth . it spit cereal all over the place . i used special k and kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears ! i returned it
1	we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone . i built a knife holder to use in a drawer . now , with the wusthof 25-slot , i have removed my home-made holder . the drawer can be used to store other items . i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years . there is no need to buy a lot of new knives . just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives . having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use . you ca n't go wrong with this super storage block
0	i really like the look of the toaster , and it does a nice job ; on one side . the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired , or likely , will have to get a new one .
0	how does it create space ? if you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high , 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide , and put this large plastic item inside it , will that give you more space or take it away ? the manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you do n't need .
1	this color is a bit too bright , but the bag it very comfortable
1	i burned up countless lesser spatulas before i found this one . try as i might , i can not damage it . not even in cast iron cookware . get one and see for yourself
0	after reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones i purchased this humidifier back in dec. well here it is early feb and this thing just plain sucks . i have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room ( 13x13 ) and it never reaches higher that 29 % . in the dry months of winter 29 % is unacceptable , and my eyes nose and throat would agree . so do n't do what i did , and save your money . or if you must try it , just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill . enjoy
1	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought . they hold an edge well and have a good balance . the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives . the only problem with the set is the steel hone . i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife . that is the only detractor from the set
0	this filter is not , in my estimation , any good . it leaves a sediment , and the end product , the coffee , tastes terrible . use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee
0	using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day , our family is hard on blenders . after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro ( both mbb* pbb* models ) i can not recommend them for serious smoothing making . here 's why : both glass- stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly . this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit . it fails often , and must be rebuilt or replaced . parts are easily purchased if you 're handy and have the correct tools . details : the assembly screws together , and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart . but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit , that it bends the metal washer below the blade . the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft can not turn . the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need , but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies
0	these glasses are very cheap . i sent everyone of them back . when i recived them 2 were broken . they are very thin
1	we run an informal barn cat rescue . this winter the temperature has been quite cold and our barn cats love the slumber mats in their little shelters . i could n't believe that they would work so well , but they do
1	these bowls have been in my home for a few years now . we have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave . they are nice looking and very functional . when we needed another bowl when one broke , we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl
1	this claims to be 100 % cotton , but my girlfriend who is n't allergic to cotton broke out in insane hives all over her body . we figured it was the blanket because we did n't use it on some days and one day it was horrible , she was using that only . it 's probably cursed by the devil . aside from this , it 's nice , soft , and also light enough to use as a summer blanket , which i plan on doing .
1	when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago , two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter . here 's why -- this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty 's litter box . the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors -- and , by golly , it 's true ! the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat . moreover , i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box . that 's a plus for any cat lover ! if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend , not surprisingly , that you use more cat litter in the box . otherwise , if you have just one cat , two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine . you should change the entire litter box once a week on average . ( i change mine about twice a week just for my cat 's comfort . ) it 's also a good idea to scoop out any `` kitty remains '' every other day or so . be very certain not to flush any `` kitty presents '' down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this . i suppose it could clog toilet pipes . moreover , as you may suspect , any `` kitty leftovers '' could have some nasty germs that we do n't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any `` kitty presents '' with a scooper . the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any `` kitty presents , '' thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box . nevertheless , i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week . place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage . in short , this is a great cat litter product at a great price . the contents of the bag last a long time , especially if , like me , you have only one cat . the manufacturer also offers customers ( us , not the cats ) an `` awards '' program with points that you can accumulate in your `` account '' with the company on the company internet website . a nice plus ! ok , fresh step -- i thank you ; my father and mother thank you ; and , most importantly , my cat says thank you ! ! ! smiles
0	i bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago . used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner . unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine . very poor quality machine .i just threw mine out in the trash bin . just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it . do n't buy this coffeemaker- a waste of good money ( i paid $ 99.99 )
1	this little franciscan apple dinnerware creamer is so beautifully made . there is a matching sugar bowl and lid , too . i do not use mine to hold cream or half-and-half on an everyday basis because i would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors . however , i do love to use it when i use my franciscan apple coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party . there is also a small milk jug , and there are two other larger pitchers in the apple pattern . i have also used the apple creamer as a server for sauces
1	my dog loves this toy . she especially loves for us to hide treats inside it . she will find a way to remove the treats without taking any of the squirrels out
0	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived . when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off . when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli . i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces . needless to say , it 's useless . this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last
0	short and not so sweet : first unit did not work at all , second unit worked for about 3 months , then sporatically , then quit . i should have believed the other reviewers . going to try the senseo supreme unit now
0	i placed my first order for the red casserole in march . it was not slated to be delivered until may ! but , i waited patiently for it . in may i see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house , but i never received it . so they send a replacement . and it is white , not red . and apparently they no longer have red
0	not too happy with this small pizza stone -- before i ordered this one for a long time i had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking . i couldnt find these bricks again -- i had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now but they were so much better than this small round stone ! my bricks made my pizza crust so crispy -- and this stone is a poor substitute for this ! my bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf -- if anyone knows what i am writing about -- pls email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name ! i am not happy with this pizza set-the rack is of no use -- the pizza cutter is a cheap one -- they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras
1	i bought 2 of these and they are so soft and comfy . i love these blankets . they are so superior to other blankets in their price range . the main reason i bought them was the price ; the colors are very nice too
0	this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced . i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well , but this one came out of the box warped . the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy , with only one strip through the center that made contact . i could return it , but for $ 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees . so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box . i would never use it again .
0	the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look . when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked . assembly was very easy - it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes ( the most ) . the design is really great - it 's very compact , perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better . great idea - poorly executed . would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product . my main concern is that the construction seems like it would n't last too long . i feel like i should attach `` sit carefully '' tag to it before anybody comes over
0	cute bookshelf -- looks goods and serves its purpose . however , the tips of it that screw together break really easily . we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week ; it only lasted through 3 shows . two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it , even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use , and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing . probably would work well if you never plan to take it down , but i 'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time
0	i bought this item brand new and in hot pink colored ( caught my eye ) . flashy , small cool looking ! however , it contains 1 led light which is bright but not wide spread . so when reading it lights up only the center of the page . you will have to constantly reposition it to keep from straining your eyes . the constant bending and reposition will affect the fragile wiring on this thing . about 10-15 uses after buying this product , i noticed a flikering ( very annoying ) . it slowly worsens the more i used it . in fact , i put the thing away and have n't used it again b/c of the annoyance . thank goodness i did n't pay much for it . value for the money is about a `` 7 '' because you get what you pay for . spend the money and try something else with more than 1 led in it . my next bet is finding something with a real light bulb in it or maybe i will just annoy my husband at bed time and read with the lights on :
1	for the cheap price ( on sale i think it was $ 5 ) i paid on it , it is pretty good quality and is soft . if
1	as a person who loathes cheap , clutter , infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day . this opener is large , requires an electric plug and takes up counter space . but to my surprise it works amazingly well . there is a foil cutter that is stored in the base . the screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating . hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out . i always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener . but this turned out to be a keeper . it 's design is contemporary and clean , although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork . it 's also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests . a pleasant surprise , highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength .
1	the picture on the website really does n't do them any justice . they are beautiful and tough , and i 'm so glad i got them
1	i have had this unit for 8 months and have n't had any problems . it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked . i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand , and i have very small hands . some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin
1	these cups are high quality stainless steel . do n't worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink . i was surprised by their weight and long handles . my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups . these miu cups are extremely sturdy . the handles on my old cups were more typical too , while these miu cups all have very long handles ( ~4.5 '' ) . at first i did n't like the asthestics of the handles , nor the fact that the smaller ones do n't stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates . however , when i needed to scoop something out of a small-mouthed container , i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles . cricisms : the interior has perpendicular corners . i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying . still , it does n't make much of a difference . also , while they 're not hard to store , they do n't stack all that well , so they 'll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers ( ~5.5 '' ) . i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease . ( ... ) for the 5 cups , i 'm extremely satisfied . i feel these are top of the line . the 7 cup set is overpriced ( ... ) , so definitely go with these . i do n't understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2/3 and 3/4 cups ? just use the 1/3 cup twice or the 1/4 three times ... or eyeball the 1 cup . ( ...
1	i recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me . not a chef , just a regular guy who likes to cook . i looked at several competators and decided that , for the price , this set was the best one out there . i 've had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and i find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up . they have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size . the only drawback that i see is that i would have preferred an 8 chefs knife instead of the 6 that comes with the set . overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice
1	exactly what i wanted . item as pictured and arrived in a timely manner
0	the first time i used it i could n't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove ! a notice that came with it said , `` this pot may not work on all stoves , refer to the owners manual . '' ( no owners manual was sent with it . ) as soon as the water started to heat , the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top ! nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface . it would have been nice to have known before ordering , as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details
0	i received my bowls today and was very disappointed . how bowls this size can be referred to as `` mixing '' bowls i can not fathom . neither do i know what could be mixed in bowls so small . the second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl . the bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the `` cereal '' bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl . the smallest bowl is a joke . i doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over . the material is nice ... melamine ... and colorful but those are the only positive statements i can make
1	this purchase came with 3 stackable racks - i thought it was only one rack . it stores very easily in a compact space and works well . i do n't know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it
0	the way this steamer was advertised , i really thought it gave out alot of steam , and lasted a decent amount of time . i tried it a few times and was very disappointed . i returned the item
1	i 've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp . it took me a little practice before i realized i was using it correctly , though . the directions could be better , and the machine does n't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening . _cooks illustrated_ magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models
0	this hamper is okay , but amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it . i ordered four , and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse . how did they arrive ? in four giant shipping boxes ; each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags ! it took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags . i live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce , and this really an insult to me and to the environment . there is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper . according to the packing list , the shipping cost on each was $ 6 , which means that due to supersaver , amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of $ 5 per hamper . amazon , shame on you , you could have shipped all four in a large envelope !
0	my 5 year old daughter loves this vacuum the only proble it does n't hold a charge i charge it over night and maybe lasts 15 min can anyone help ... .
0	i purchased this coffee maker and in three months time , threw it out . what a piece of [ ... . ] . you can never get a decent hot cup of coffee ( it is lukewarm at best ) and the carafe not only breaks , so you have to replace it , but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup . what a dissapointment this machine is . mr. coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee , but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor . i would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone . the only nice thing i can say about it is the programmable timer worked . i would not give this coffee maker one star , but that was the lowest rating available . if it were up to me , i would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating !
0	i ordered this product 3 months back - as they say `` got into the line '' . this item was part of an larger order so i could have gotten free shipping . now i get an email from amazon stating this item has been cancelled as it was further delayed and as i did not respond to thier email for extending the wait time . i never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered - if i need one then i will end up paying shipping too . amazon is normally good about these things - how can they still have it listed on the site when they are cancelling orders in the pipeline
0	the lid drops in half the time you 're trying to put it on . the first six meals or so smell `` bad '' ( spoiled ) as they are cooking.. i think it 's the sealing ring ! what a god-awful smell for a kitchen
1	i 'm really happy with this shoe rack . i 'd like it to be a little bit taller , but it holds the shoes very effectively and fits well in my closet . i 'd definitely recommend it
1	i have just opened the three sets and they are beautiful . they arrived in perfect condition and i can not believe how fast the delivery was . a perfect addition for our dinner table
1	these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys . they are treated with catnip , but to be honest , i do n't think my cat knows the difference . unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts , zanies rainbow mice also rattle , since they have tiny pebbles inside them . a word of caution about this though : the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge ( which makes up the body of the mouse ) . the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued . after my cat played with one of the mice , the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed . since there are pebbles inside , unsupervised play might not be very safe . it 's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them . other than that , these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good . quantity is important here , because , due to their small size , most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture . since you get 60 mice in this package , you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action . in the long run , it 's a lot cheaper than buying them individually
0	this is not even a toy . do not waste your money on this item . amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a `` quick '' machine . nothing about this machine functions well . never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches . amazon should not carry this item , it has lowered the quality of amazon 's products in my view
0	these are more like 200-250 thread count . soft at first , but after a couple of washings , they feel rough , loose their shape , and wrinkle easily . i purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment .
0	i am sure there is a lesson in my experience . i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt/pepper did not go where i wanted it . i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away . based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube . i am sad to say that i again found it 's performance to be a big disappointment
1	when trying to decide if this model ( 3670g ) was the right vacuum for me , i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it 's features on the internet..and from the manufacturer itself . first of all , many online retailers flat out state ( inaccurately ) that this model has a `` hepa '' ( high efficiency particulate air ) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon ( at least as of this writing ) seems to indicate that it has one as well . i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *not* have a `` hepa '' filter . more on that a little later in this review however . i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number ( i.e . 3670g ) . be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 ( also called the 3670a in some places ) and the 3670*g* models . they look identical and appear to be identical ( both are yellow and black ) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger , 12 amp motor . amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum . for only about a $ 5- $ 10 difference in total price , i 'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered . it only seems to confuse the matter . the 3670 also does *not* have the `` hepa '' filter incidentally . i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase . it is compact , very powerful and great for my needs . the noise ... while high ... is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans . the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful , not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down . the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides ( by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing ) . the 3670g *does* require bags . it is not a `` bagless '' model however and while some may prefer a bagless model , i preferred a model that used bags . the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience ( of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag ) . the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate . three attachment tools are included , a crevice tool , a 10 '' floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush ( about 2 '' wide ) on the end . the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up ( 3 '' wide ) . in my opinion , this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5 '' wide . the 2 '' wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 '' wide , i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces ( such as a wall for example ) in order to cover the area needed . i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5 '' wide had been included . as it is , i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra . finally , a comment about the `` hepa '' filter . some people ( particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air ) may want cleaners that include this item . in my case , i did not want this since i do n't need it and `` hepa '' filters can be quite expensive to change and replace ( unless you get a washable one ... also expensive ) . since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter ( some descriptions flatly stated that it does ) , i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure . it turned out that even eureka 's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it did n't have one . if you *do* want the `` hepa '' filter , you would want the 3684d ... which looks the same but is red in color , slightly more expensive , and has more and better quality attachments as well as the `` hepa '' filter . by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment ( which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g ) , you are at the price of a 3684d . in that case , the 3684d may well be a better value for you , particularly if you like the `` hepa '' filter . overall , i think `` the boss '' series of canister vacuums is a great product . eureka ( and amazon as well ) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however .

0	i thought i was getting a set of forks not one fork . the picture and description are deceptive . the picture depicts a set ( s ) i am sure the one fork i got is great but i have 5 other hands that need a fork as well
0	if this is in a jade or perhaps brick ... other earth colors , let me know . why waste everyone 's time with such a lame description
1	does what it claims to , elegantly , but small leaf particles get through the filter . takes time for tea to brew
1	i 've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty , gloppy mess i throw in it , including shortening , butter , cream cheese , sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine . i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out . i have n't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version . they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are
0	my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats . though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules , it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement . unfortunately , they just do n't work . becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies . even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle . even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly . they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly . another problem is the scoop . even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle , it always left turds behind . those turds would then go through the whole cyle , which includes drying . that means that , even if they 're scooped up the next time it cycles , they 're going to be so dry and hard they 'll never be ground up properly . again , this results in clogs . we had them for a little over 2 weeks . in that time we had to run extra cyles , backflush and even take them apart and clean them . this product results in far more work , not less
1	this whisk is very nice , and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand . one thing i had n't foreseen , however , is actually pretty obvious . the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces , so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction . it is exactly as advertised , though , and i am very happy to have it
1	we have some pretty nasty water from the tap , but this pur filter system makes it taste so good . i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once . the hand held ones i 've used hold about 3 . i do n't know how pure the water is , but it sure tastes great .
0	very hard to put together , drawers came broken both times- cute though- not at all sturd
1	i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working . i find it easy to insert the cans . it works great if you follow the directions . it 's not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around . cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink . it 's a good buy
1	after reading every review on deep fryers i could find , i finally decided on this one . it has been great and i could n't ask for anything better or more easy to use . i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this was greatly appreciated . cleanup is easy also . after waiting for the oil to cool , the pan , lid and rack can go into the dishwasher . only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy . the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be . i would recommend this with no caveats
1	there is no substitute for le creuset 's ability to distribute heat evenly , withstand heat without staining , and to top it off , it 's soooo easy to clean ! worth every penny
0	i bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this does n't work great on my electric stove . if you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place . if you ca n't leave it up high you do n't get good grill marks . i end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down . does n't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well . you are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven . the coating chips easily . i am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but i think it worth it in the long run
1	this knife block is a must for any miracle blade 3 owner . it fits _all_ the knives in the original set plus the four bonus all purpose knives included with the block . holds 14 knives plus kitchen scissors in a neat , compact , counter saving block . it 's a perfect
1	as stated before in many a review , this machine is the best deal for the money . paired with a real espresso grinder ( which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself ) this machine is capable of producing real espresso . my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december , and the machine is still in working condition . my only real beef with this machine is the wand . i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher , however , the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off . right into my milk . i have taken to using the wand without either of them on , but this is n't optimum for latte foam . the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead . this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing . but i 'd rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra $ 300 for something in stainless steel . all in all , the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it . woohoo . - by zoe ros , not tim .
0	amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered . we hoped this one would be an exception . it was , but only in that it may be the poorest of them all . ours buzzed loudly whenever in use . never had a toaster buzz before . we toast bread at least twice a day , and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible . it has no bagel setting ( which toasts the cut side more than the crust side ) , so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast . what 's more , it toasts completely unevenly . one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned . and it 's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently . as far as looks go , de'longhi did just as bad a job . the photos look cool , but the crumb tray this unit `` sits '' upon is actually wider than the unit itself , so there is a big uneven gap at the seam . it 's the lower line you see in the photos -- but they make it look real nice for that ! what you do n't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown . this makes it look broken , like two pieces of something that no longer fit together . if de'longhi had spent even a second thinking about this , they would have done the opposite : the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit , which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look . ( we even went to a store [ yes , a real store ] to confirm that they are all like this , and they are . ) also , the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element . there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it does n't scratch the metal surface of the toaster . however , two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping , and though they slipped right back in , all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out ( only friction holds them in ) and you will loose them very quickly -- especially if you ever wash the rack . we 're happy to pay extra for a quality item -- even a toaster -- but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment . final advice : stick to the $ 20 toasters with functions such as bagel , defrost , and dual controls . if it 's ugly , keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it . this one looks broken , performs poorly , and costs a lot of money . if you do buy this model , maybe you 'll get ours ... we returned it
1	i really like this bookcase . it is attractive , and easy to set up . simply fold the shelves into place . although it is easy to set up , it is pretty sturdy . there are spaces in the back that items could fall through , but there are wood slats to hold books in place . i also like the size of the bookcase : it is not too wide but holds a lot because it is tall , and the mission sides are nice
0	at first i thought this was a great product . if you only make cheese fondue it is great . the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe . the problem i 've had with mine is that it does n't get beyond about 320 degrees . the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up , it only got up to 323 degrees and would n't go any further . so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it wo n't do the job well . i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break-away cord but this is ridiculous . touch the darn thing and the cord falls free . very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue . people kept telling me that the cheese was getting `` hard '' because the cord had fallen off , again . next time i 'd get a pot that had a thermometer built in , do n't rely on the heat setting dial .
0	ok , so i thought i was crazy , not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot . people were making fun of me , `` how can you burn anything in a crockpot '' ? ? now , i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone . i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot ! now i know that they are not supposed to be like this ! ! ! do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk ! ! ! ! ! on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours ! ! ! ! i am trashing mine today ! !
1	these bowls are so pretty , the colors are great . they are a lot heavier then i thought they would be also . i 'm so pleased with this purchase
1	wow- this speaker is fantastic ! ! ! it took a little time to get it setup but once we figured it out , it worked like one of our top quality indoor speakers ! ! ! when i read the reviews i was hopeful but not sure . now we love it and would recommend it to anyone ! we can use it in the font yard , down by the swings and even in the basement ( which we did for our son 's pirate brithdday bash ) . please do n't pass this up ! if you are in the market for an outdoor speaker , this is great ! it may take a little time to set up but worth it . enjoy ! !
1	although it does n't mention it , these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 . i had to email hamilton beach to find out , but they were very helpful and responded right away . when the filters arrived from amazon , i saw that on the box it says `` fits models 04160 , 04161 04150 . '' with our cat and houseful of antiques , we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around . i run this model in our office , under the table which holds the computer . since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated . i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job . the regular settings can be louder than expected , but i leave them on the `` whisper quiet '' setting when we 're in that room and i do n't even notice them being on . i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners
1	i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one ! with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo , it provides a surround-sound like atmosphere . also it has quite a loud capacity for volume . i mean if you wanted to , you could really get it crankin ' . anyway , it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod . the sound clarity is very crisp and clear . the only , tiny flaw , i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs , a soft , high-pitched whine is sometimes incurred . however , once the song begins to play , this whine disapears immediately . i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price
1	this bread slicer is quite good . it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it . it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves . i have found though , that if i bake the largest size loaf , the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container .
0	the frother works well as others have said . unfortunately , it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning . i 've only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info . this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events
0	i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles . this is a disappointment ! save your money and search for a better kettle . this one is n't a good buy or a good produc
0	i rate this negative five stars . i just purchased it , thinking , after reading all the reviews , that it was great . what a crock ! ! ! ! it 's absolutely worthless . it does not clean the water . it 's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy . the water flows and the motor is running , the charcoal is in place but it does n't clean the water . i 'm better off with a bowl that i clean every day . this thing just swishes around dirty water . do n't waste your money
1	i am looking for a new book light , and as a former owner of this light , i was suprised at the bad bulb stats . this bulb , like halogen bulbs , get very hot . it is imperative that you do not touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it . the oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp . and hastens failure . hope this help
0	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it . when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had . the third time i used it the belt broke . with each use , my back would start hurting . the forward motion was very easy , but pulling it back was hard . i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it
0	i own the graphite style of this set . i was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great , did n't chip easily , and was a great size . after a year of use i 've come up with a list of problems : the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that can not be removed . the semi-matte finish acquires a `` powdery '' , almost bleached , look to it after many washings ( says dishwasher safe , guess that means the colors do n't wash away immediately ) my biggest complaint : we bought these because they were `` microwave safe '' . i do n't know what microwave safe means to most people , but it means to me that i could put a plate , bowl or cup in the microwave , heat up the contents , and then safely remove the object and use it . in the case of the set i purchased , it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode . unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set , it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the ( plate/bowl/cup ) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the ( plate/bowl/cup ) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave . they get very hot ! ( cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f ! ) i 've only broken 2 items from the set , both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned ( first time i thought it was a fluke , second time i learned my lesson ) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave . i emailed sango several times and received no response at all . while i liked the set a lot initially , i have been very disappointed over time with its quality . i will never purchase another from sango again
1	i love these pieces . i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai
0	i used an avocado smaller than the tool , so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it 'd fit . then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive , while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell . it made me realize that it 's not *that* hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife ... oh well
1	this is pretty in a rough casual sketched style . this will require ironing out of the dryer .
0	too bad i did n't come here first , at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did . it 's too bad too because this thing is a technological marval ... except it 's defective from the very start . my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side . i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff . i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site : `` a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is `` ideal '' , so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water does n't boil ( add salt ) , or if it boils too rapidly ( add distilled water ) . this will prevent `` spurting '' , boiling over and overheated reservoirs . '' the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already ! the unit boils like the bejesus on low , putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking `` reset/refill '' light . i tried 4 times and even called tech support ( they were pretty clueless , are you listening bionaire ? ) . it 's really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified . i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you ca n't tilt it to fix the problem ( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason
0	we bought this krups flf2-j4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs . it is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water . however , an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains . it had n't diminished during that time . it smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee . not pleasant . we felt it just was n't safe . i 've repacked it and will return it if possible . krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual .
0	i often have to mix by hand , things always end up dry and grainy . might be partially my fault - maybe i should try adding the ingredients as it 's mixing . it makes a really huge mess . my mother and i both bought one , but i told her to return hers , it was n't worth it
0	i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before.but the picture on the site and the product review looked good.when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped.the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished.i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet.its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time
0	i purchased this toaster oven because i loved its exterior design and thought it would look great in my kitchen . it did ... until the middle knob came off after less than 6 months of use . i 've been using a pair of pliers to turn it on for the last 5 months while i await my replacement part . i have followed-up on my request with delonghi customer service on a number of occassions and they offer no solution other than to continue to wait . i even left a message with a supervisor and received no response whatsoever . i vow to never buy a delonghi product again . still waiting for that knob..
1	i like this grater . it 's easy to use and clean . and , nothing is better on salad than freshly grated cheese

1	ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob , i am more of a coffee nut , i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose . and for a guy like me this machine is perfect ! ! i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret . i have had the machine about 3 weeks now , i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time , but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great . this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased , my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes ! the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods , i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient ... and dont get me wrong , the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had , very quickly , but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots . but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me , it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for , be it a straight shot , a cappucino , or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you , may not be good enough for a coffee snob ... but just right for a coffee nut ! oh and one hint i found very helpfull ... turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it ( the longer the better ) with your cups up on the warmer . i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out , i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup , but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso !
0	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after . this one did n't even work out of the box . there was no mist , just air . oh well , i figured i was taking my chances anyway . if you buy this , hopefully you have better luck . update : nowadays , most grocery stores sell pre-packaged , pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil . it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil . i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time
0	we waited too long to try this out after it came . we would return it if it was n't so late . it takes forever to warm up and forever to cook ! then the waffle is not hot ! not happy at all with it
1	this krups toaster is the best i have ever used ! perfect toast every time . the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides . the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife . the defrost function works great . if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally , they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices . the crumb tray slides out easily , eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster . all in all , the best toaster i have ever owned
1	i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon . it 's a beautiful print , and a good color that matches my drapes , but what i did n't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it 's also just one big piece of fabric . no fitted edges , or elastic to hold it in place - kind of disappointing . but since i was covering a futon , i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds , shove a wooden dowel into the crease , and voila ! a great looking couch appeared . so , all things considered , a pretty good buy for the money
1	after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband . i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them , but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso ( and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth -- makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines ) , i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations . i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it . my main concern was how hot the coffee would be , and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee . i 've read reviews about the noise it makes , and after having the deloghi product , the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all . we are very happy with it . buy it , you 'll be happy too
1	it works well , and it 's good for the price . not too stable and sturdy , but it gets the job done just fine
1	nice little toaster with good price . just be careful it can get really hot when toasting .
1	i received the shams , and was suprised with the colour . these are almost a mustard yellow , not what i would call sunlight . the picture shown reflects a lot of light , thus looking paler . the quality looks to be good , and i did wash and iron them . they do look good with my bedspread ( a blue laura ashley floral ) and pick up the yellow in it . for the price , i think they are a good buy . it 's nice to have a change now and again ...
1	* purchased at petsmart * seems to work well * very quiet when operating properly * took our cats a little over a week to get used to it * the flow is n't very good when the setting is low . we keep it at medium . * i clean it out about once a week . cat hair from our medium-haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well
0	very thin and unsteady . could n't open it without having to hold the back of it . it wobbled side to side as i was forcing it to open . i sent it back as soon as i got it
1	i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep . i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans . my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus , saying he has n't slept this good in a long time . the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom . very sturdy steel construction , easy assembly of the legs . 3 speeds . top speed is out of this world . almost like a wind storm . me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house . what a riot ! i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation , sleep aid and some silly fun
0	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers . it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped , and they were not as light and crispy . it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs ' , which i could n't find in local stores . since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs ' for all and found the postage/handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one ( incredibly light ) pack .
0	worked just fine for over a year , then started behaving very oddly . among the various problems this tob-30bc unit exhibited , the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off , not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle , sending alarms when switched off , not being able to switch the unit off ! this unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and i consider it to be a fire hazard . repeated communications to cuisinart remain unanswered .
1	this is a great heater . it warms up the room very quickly , it has a nice feature of oscillating , it also works as a fan ; the thermometer is good
1	extremely delighted with this product . not only does it perform flawlessly , it 's beautiful to look at . combine that with the best price anywhere , thanks to amazon and target , and you have perfection ! thanks .
0	i paid what i would call a fairly high price for a blanket i could have gotten from a discount club for half the price . the photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed , the left/right sides are simply cut . i expect this to disolve within 4 washes . will not buy from this manufacturer again
1	this set is so versatile . i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them . i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard , but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them ! great for appetizer containers , for making mini casseroles ( or quiches ) , creme brulee , serving soup , i 've even baked mini bread loaves in them ! the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets -- i usually end up using four at a time instead of two .
1	this whale is so much fun i got it for when my sisters kids came down . they had a hard time staying on it though but it was fun for me . it was such a hit i have two now they got one for me before they left saying now you gots two so next time we come you can ride too . overall great , strong , and fun :
1	this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water/coffee path . the boiler , porta-filter baskets , brew group , and steam wand are all stainless steel ( albeit the wand has a plastic tip ) . i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta-filter itself is made of aluminum ( although it does have stainless basket inserts ) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32 . it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta-filter after exiting the stainless baskets - although capresso implies no in their ads .
0	i was very , very disappointed with the performance of the tribest blender . i bought it to blend breakfast smoothies ... .nothing fancy ... .just some protein powder and soy milk . i even bought the larger cup . the unit is very , very under powered . did not mix the ingredients . had to transfer everything to my larger , more `` industrial '' blender . would not recommend this unit for any serious blending . save your money or put it towards a better unit . this product is a rip off . does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder
0	it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out . according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid . while it lasted it worked fine .
0	i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway . i was stupid . i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months . that one is great and has held up after multiple washings . it is still so soft . so i just did n't belive the two bad reviews . i was wrong . the bad reviews are correct . i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday . they are not of the same quality of the one i already have . they are packed at least 3 different ways . i think maybe some of them are someone else 's defective returns . i do n't think these are first quality . there are many snags . there is at least one blue stain . one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily . the quality of the construction is not good . some are soft , some are rough . i returned all 9 . do not buy
1	this soap dish is beautiful , practical and sturdy . best of all , it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray , leaving your bathroom clean and dry . recommended .
0	i bought this oven recently . it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job . all except the rotisserie ; when used , grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full . i was very dissapointed . i contacted them via email today , they say they will get with me in 24 hrs . we 'll see
0	normally things i purchase , have no problem . this item is now being used to heat water when company comes over for tea . has to be the worse item to make coffee yet . always purchase the whole beans and grind the coffee myself , this item just never got the coffee 's true wonderful flavor . perhaps because it was a refurbished item , but i just think hamilton beach needs to improve this item big time
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out . it was wonderful . wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one , i bought this item . i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it . i was suspect when i opened it . poor quality material . poor bed fit . very very warm on the lowest setting . after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires , which are quite large , in my ribs -- it had to come off . i had rather be cold and i hate being cold
1	i ordered this china specifically to use during the holidays . it arrived in perfect condition with all pieces accounted for , and is absolutely lovely . the red and gold combination can be used year-round , and it is dishwasher safe ! i like it so much i intend to order another service for 8 . excellent value
1	for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd rack/tower ... then one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box ( no display ) . it is exactly what i had been looking for . slapped on the two foot ends and done ! perfect fit for dvds , 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases , like the ones new line cinema puts out , you can fit more . i do n't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot . i have many oversized ones . the hardwood is great too , just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall . if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then ... it is worth it . i am almost ready to buy a third one soon
1	soft , comfortable , perfect . i came back to buy more . i want to throw the rest of my sheets away . i was reluctant to buy sheets without being able to touch them first , but am so glad i took the chance
1	i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily ! the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it 's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home . it does n't fit under my kitchen sink faucet . i do n't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer ( wish i did ) ) otherwise it would be a snap to fill . i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs . the container is really heavy once it 's full . my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one ( 2 gallon or 1 gallon ) , waterer . it would be easier to handle . i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it ! it holds a whole 5lb . bag of food which is great ! so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer . oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it ! :
0	if you 're of italian heritage and you grate a lot of cheese , do n't waste your time with this one . when the quantity of cheese in the grater gets low , it tends to be very difficult to turn . it also did n't last as long as i expected . try a different one instead
0	if you 're looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident , keep looking ... this harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver ( although i 'm not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big , strong dog ) but i seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision . the dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles/snaps which are not even very strong-looking -- i have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars . plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision . if you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident , look for one that has actually been tested/rated similar to human car safety devices
1	this swissmar fondue set is excellent . i love how stylish it is . i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do : - cheeses - broths for meat - chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for . the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with , when done with that course , remove the ceramic bowl , pour the water out of the copper pot , and put in your broth . although i have n't used it for chocolate yet , i 'm sure it will work well for that . using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat . others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir . of course if you 're into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking , the `` thick '' part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest ! the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used . also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course . you will need to refill it between cheese and broth - of course make sure it 's extinguished and cool before doing so . i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store . an excellent purchase - i am very happy with it .
1	when i was looking to purchase a new machine , i only was looking for a bunn . bunn makes the best coffee machines , none can compare . every diner , coffee house , and dunkin ' donuts only use bunn machines . the a10 is one great machine ! brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly . everyone in my office is very happy with the unit . if you 're a serious coffee drinker , please do n't cheap out on a mr.coffee , braun or krupps -- frankly they can not brew coffee at the speed , temperature , or taste of a bunn unit . i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch
0	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better item light and not providing the warmth expected from this price level . feels incomplet
0	some how my previous review text got a little glitched up . but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut . the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected ... . it 's the first time i ; ve been totally disappointed ... . we 're returning the knives because they are not worth the money . really , they look great in the picutre , but they are very poor quality . why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars
0	okay - there 's something wrong with brita filters . they do n't always fit into the pitchers - when i tilt the pitcher i can hear the filter shifting inside - and yes , i am aligning it properly . it may filter out impurities contained in the tap water , but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles . i 've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month , but darned if there is n't a problem with every single one ! do n't buy this - look for another alternative
0	i dont recoment you to buy this product . i dont under stand why they made i
1	my husband goes to bed much later than i do . until i got this gadget , i had to go to sleep with a bedroom light on , and he would leave a low light on in the living room in order to see his way to the bedroom . i have installed 3 of these units , one in the living room , one in the hall , and one in the bedroom . they light up sequentially as he comes to be
0	beware ! on off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged . the place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it 's been about 2 weeks . : -
0	so , this clock woke me up alright ! the snooze did n't work , and then i could n't turn it off ! i had to rip the batteries out of it to get it to stop ... it is very cheaply made ( explains the price i guess ) , but yeah it works just fine as long as you do n't need to use the snooze ever
1	we recently purchased this kit to install on the top and bottom stairs with a kidco gate . it was very easy to install , its very sturdy and we did not have to drill any holes into our banister . we would definately recommend it to everyone
0	i loved this when we first got it home . i 'm handicapped and ca n't push a big vacuum . so , this was just right to pick up the `` top showing '' dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week . but after two months the ac adapter cord just snapped in half . it was oddly brittle from the very beginning . i contacted euro pro who would not replace it under warranty . so , i ordered a new adapter from them ( which came to approx . $ 15 ) with shipping . now six weeks later , they sent me a card saying `` due to overwhelming demand ... .. '' the adapter is on back order . i wonder why they have such a large demand ? funnily enough , the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it 's last charge . but , no more . i think it 's time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned ( no power ) push sweeper
0	the heater that i received was defective . i down loaded a return label from amazon.com and returned the heater . i received my refund very quickly . i have two other delonghi heaters of a different model that i am very happy with but are no longer manufactured . this was my first experiance with this particular model
0	the legs were a bit tricky to put down , and when i did , i busted the mounts . never even used this thing threw it away . coleman makes one that i bought that 's better built , and excalibur electronics has one available as well that i also bought - i like excalibur 's better , but both are better than this piece of junk . all 3 brands are in the same price range . interestingly , there are n't a lot of portable ac/dc fan options out there ... i bought these for camping in florida
1	the bissell flip-it saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop
0	this is the most loathesome appliance i have ever owned . i hate everything about it . some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit , so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it . this may not be such a problem if the stupid `` self propelled '' function were n't constantly trying to shoot backward , meaning i need both hands just to push the unit forward . it 's like i 'm dancing with my vacuum and we 're fighting for the lead . ridiculous . i have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house , and i wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster . oh -- it also came with a free little red dd sweeper -- the handle of which broke the first time i tried to use it . i do n't know if dd came under new management or what , but i will never buy one of their products again
1	this fan is an excellent value for its price . it gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds . additionally , it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level . i bought this fan because my old one had `` died '' in the middle of a hot summer . this one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room . the only reason that i did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right . this has happened to other similar fans i have had , but not so soon after purchase . if you 're mechanical , you can probably correct the problem by yourself . i do recommend this fan for anyone and any place . oh , did i say the remote is perfect ? ? ? because i am handicapped , it saves me from getting up and down too often
1	this whisk is excellent ; it is well made and easy to clean . i use mine all the time to beat eggs for making omelets etc . it is excellent quality that will last a lifetime . highly recommended ! a+
1	this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats . great product at a great price
