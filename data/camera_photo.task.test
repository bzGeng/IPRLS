1	this gadget is a must-have for gadget lovers ... ..and picture lovers . it is compact , solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag . the images are crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product and if you do n't ... ..not to worry the camera gets all of it .
1	well , besides a whole bucket full of money , one of them lets you take photos in lower light , okay , that 's obvious . the 16-35mm is a bit heavier , but not so you 'd notice , unless maybe you were carrying it around all day , without eating and you 're a bit over the hill . so why pay the extra money , unless , of course , you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening ? maybe you should n't , because i 've been doing a lot of photo taking with both , film and digital , and as one would expect from the `` l '' lenses , the photos are crisp and sharp . in fact i keep i the 17-40 on the camera i carry around all day , you know , the one i might leave on the table in a restaurant when i got to the restroom . it 's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara and i take a lot of early morning photos . she shoots old houses , and she never , ever goes out without the 16-35mm . she swears by it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there is a difference , i 'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense , sara is not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you ca n't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home from the se
1	at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples , but i found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better . also , the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away . just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution . after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results . **another plus : this one came with a wall charger . most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge . the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer
1	ok ... i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good .
0	probably a very good case , but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment , a strap and a velcro . the shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap . for the olympus stylus digital cameras , look to the lowepro case - better case and value
0	i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the `` female '' end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black `` spring '' cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe `` portrait/landscape '' grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords
0	i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera , reviews here , price and functions . at the same time , i also purchased the larger xd card . almost out of the box , this camera has given me nothing but grief . what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo . a month or so after purchase , the lens would not open , or it would not open totally . i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause ... .after changing the batteries , the problems still existed - some of the time . not always - just sporadically . just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities . in addition to that , now that i 'm looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i 'm out the cost of that as well . another malfunction of this camera is after `` erasing '' all photos on the xd card , taking more photos and uploading the new photos , i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones ? i do n't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera . i would not recommend this camera to anyone ... .it 's a total dud . i 'm very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons . good luck fujifulm ... you need it
1	the picture viewer is a fun way to carry lots of digital pictures in a small device . however , setting it up and loading it was a nightmare . i spent hours writing to tech support and ultimately on the phone to figure out how to move the pictures from my computer to the device
1	i recently moved into the prosumer level of digital . the canon d30 has proven to be an awesome camera . there maybe better ( d60 ) , but if you are serious about digital , the d30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price . there is a slight lag between shots , but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains , the time between shots is hardly a distraction
0	excelent product.i get about 15 times the life of ordinary batteries . i would reccomend to anybody who uses their camera a lo
1	i 'm a long time canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade . i can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera , the pictures are fuzzy . take a look at one of the newer canons with image stabilization and i think you 'll be happier .
1	i 'm like most people with a digital camera . i take a bazillion pictures , develop 10 % onto paper , and then banish the other 90 % to computer storage archives . i mean , i 'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer , but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints ? that 's why i decided to get a digital picture frame . i had been looking for quite some time , but was always turned off by the small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 '' widescreen unit , with the 800x480 pixel display ! there were no reviews on amazon ( at the time ) , but spec-wise it had what i wanted ; a larger display and higher resolution . i took the chance and ordered one and am i glad i did ! the display is huge , and the pictures look crisp . colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated lcd computer monitor . the interchangeable frames ( it comes with a black one as well as the white one ) make it easy to match with your d√©cor . the litte remote is easy to use , but easy to lose as well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find . the built-in mp3 player is a nice touch . the speakers are n't that great ( it is a picture frame after all ) , but it 's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode . there is a variety of transition effects to choose from . i have n't tried playing videos on it , so i ca n't comment on that feature . that being said , there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars . 1 . the adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic . i 've seen other frames that have much nicer backs . yes , i know it 's the front you are looking at , but the stand should be sturdier , in my opinion . 2 . the angle of the stand , while adjustable , is simply held in place by friction . it actually has one setting that it can click into , but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position . 3 . there seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode . well , to be more precise , if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit the slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything is fine . i have recreated this problem , but i do n't know if it 's just my frame or all of these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it is perfect . 4 . this is not really a complaint about the product but more about coby 's specs . on their website they state the lcd is 800x480 . great ! so i ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution . however , when i got the frame and started using it , i noticed that all of my pictures had black ( blank ) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture . it turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this from total electronics ( one of the amazon vendors ) and it arrived quickly . when i reported the `` dead pixel '' problem ( which turned out to be a software bug , not a defect , so to speak ) , they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked . now that 's customer service ! overall , i am very pleased with this product . in reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i 'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it . with this purchase , that was totally unncessary !
0	the reviews are worthless unless the writer mentions the model of device they are using the batteries for . fifty percent of the reviews here do n't mention what they were using the batteries for . do this service justice and mention the type and model equipment for which the battereis are utilized
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras . it fits in the pocket easily . i 'm satisfied
1	nice portable background support kit . stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution . easy and quick to put up . i put it up by myself with very little effort . all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting
0	i loved my 4.1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005 . then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it . if i would tap the camera they would go away . but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working . it would turn on but then shut off . i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did n't work . it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out . so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use . so sad camera dea
1	easy to get up and going . we run a floral business and it allows us to take great pics for the website ! worth every penny
0	this canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out , on a 1080p monitor . i have used other hdv format cameras , and they were much better . the low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain . if you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light , but still plauged in low light
0	i am fascinated with this machine . it has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows . the battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when i go touring . if i take care to shut the display down as soon as i dont need it anymore i find that when i am on a cruise ship or visiting another country i can take all the movies i usually want - - and recharge when i get back to my room at night . the only problem is playback on a tv or pc . the bundled software made by ulead is not user friendly and , whereas the previous xacti i had played back images and video clips in the order i had taken , this one separates them and plays back either clips or images . before i played back through my panasonic hard disk dvd recorder and recorded a dvd directly . now i have to go into my pc and do a whole lot of editing and so far the `` movie factory '' program keeps crashing . i imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program , or i will learn to use ulead , but for the time being the pictures and clips ihave taken have very good detail , and the machine has operated flawlessly .
0	this is the worst camcorder i 've ever owned.the picture quality is the worst.i ca n't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance.if i move a little , or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus.i have n't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet . i recommend panasonic , it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear.it 's my fault i did n't do my research before i bought this
0	i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable . the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds . during this time the camera 's view finder goes black and you can not use it . because the camera is so slow , we have missed many important pictures of our children ; consequently , we found that for any important family events , this is not the camera we use . i own nikon 35mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product . if it is your life your recording , i recommend that you buy a different camera
0	i only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so i returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge .
0	i picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake . the class came chipped , scratched and smuged ; tiffen filters are of very poor quality . do yourself a favor , like i did , and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . this tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting
0	amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product . usually i like to have actually used the product before writing a review , but since i have n't received it yet , that is not possible . it has been over 1 month since i ordered this with the crutchfield storefront at amazon.com . amazon 's site indicated the product was in stock , but since ordering , it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now . i just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user . i do n't know where this is manufactured , or who crutchfield 's supplier is , but needless to say i am not entirely pleased with this whole process ... which does n't really have anything to do with amazon . i hear dv cable does it 's job , but i 'll have to wait and see
1	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy . i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag . it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible ( has a divider you can place where ever you want ) so you can secure cameras however you wish
1	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr , battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues : the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging , it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them . if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these , and the charger is okay , just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most
1	the philips digital frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that i 've gotten . the resolution and picture quality superb , and the sleek outer design is an additional plus . also , the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord , which is very convenient . as another reviewer said , you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want . it would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a blackberry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to . also , i would like to see philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well , that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the usb flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card . thank you
1	i bought this together with the sony alpha ( very good deal from amazon ) . the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18-70 . images are very sharp and the lens is built very well . great for wildlife imaging . the other reviewers are right ; the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera . the end of the lens does rotate while zooming . it may not be good for some filters
1	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
1	i was using this lense for a week now with d50 and i can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is awesome . at 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional ( like myself ) . at 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in nef ( raw ) format and use photo editor software ( i use nikon 's capture nx ) photoes become master pieces . at 22f , outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person . i highly recommend this lense
1	the item was exactly as expected . the packaging for shipment , along with the other item i ordered , was unacceptable . a child could have done better
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag , this lens has serious trouble with sharpness . only at high shutter speeds ( 1/250 and above approx . ) or with a good flash and middle apertures ( f/8 to f/22 approx . ) does it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving to buy and l-series or the is usm version
1	i already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my efs 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the lp1116 . this pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens . the cord is strong and silky and does n't open accidently the way a silky cord would . obviously we ca n't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand . the moment i buy another lens , i shall have to buy its matching pouch
1	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards ) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation , make sure to get a memory stick with it though , because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics . this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again
0	i feel that it is just way too much money for what you get . i own a lot of professional ( canon ) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there . but it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price . i have the s80 . no complaint there . the leather case was just way too tight , which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera . the flap issue is an issue . the neck chain is a bit short , and similar and better items can be had for a lower price . if you shop around you can also find the li battery for less . i 'm not upset , but just disappointed with what i got for the price
0	they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill . the batteries charged lasted atleast five hours , so no complaints there , but the charger would keep coming out from the wall . it only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it would n't stay all the way in , i tried several outlets , finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all
1	this was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable . they sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly
0	normally i wouldnt write a review , but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share . my sister first bought the camera , and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded to buy one for myself , and a couple of months after i had it , my screen also inexplicably failed to work . and then for christmas , my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one , and yet again , shortly after purchase , the screen was broken . i do accept some responsibility for the damage , i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around a bit . but three times ? i dont find this to be a coincidence , and i do not reccomend that you risk your money , because you too may have to replace it after 3 months
0	this camera has a very poor lens . at 1x zoom , the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous ; try taking a picture of a tiled wall . image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100 % ; scaled down on a computer monitor , the quality is ok. color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance . [ ... ]
0	i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work . this is terrible , terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product .
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it . the quality of the pictures is very poor , showing large grain , even at shq and low iso settings . no combination of settings seems to improve quality
1	i got this camera so i could have more control . i 'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings ... i have n't explored all the fancy settings much , but there are tons of them . i really like the continuous shooting option so i 'm more likely to catch a good action shot . the wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups . i think it 's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos , but do n't feel quite ready for an slr
0	i bought this toy a year ago and tried it on my etx-90ec telescope all i got is hazy moon video , the resolution is poor the maximum pixels is 640*420 which is very pooooooor resolution it didnt reach even 1 mega pixels , hey we 've got now 12 megapixels chips why dont provide it celstron ? ? ? tried to edit it with the included poor software but it was useless i thought it might need bigger telescope so the aperture would be higher and i might able to see some stars or galaxies as per advertisement i went to my cousin who has lx90 8 '' telescope , the result was bright dots seem to be stars i dont recommend this toy its a waste of money if you want really to take serious photograph try to attach your film or digital camera to your telescope by t-adapte
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt -- there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at '34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .
1	i 'm using it for a few months now ; i have n't found a single problem so far . earlier , i was using an old finepix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good ; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment . this is not a problem any more . also , i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom . in general , i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out : - ) . sure , there are better cameras on the market ; however , considering the price it is just a great deal
1	i 've had this digital camera for almost a year . it 's the fourth camera i 've owned . i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere . being an amateur photographer ( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others ) , i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera . it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse ( for formal nights out ) . the size and weight of this camera is its best feature , and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera , too . this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery . my pictures have always turned out beautifully , with wonderful color and crispness . i have discovered that the `` automatic '' lighting feature is not always the most ideal , but you can re-program just about anything on this camera . it 's really quite a good camera , and given its price these days with the newer generations out there , it 's a steal
0	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market . after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures . the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download . it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child . the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up . even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver ( the smallest one you can find ) to achieve it . unfortunately , i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to
0	i got this for my s70 . first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to `` radio control '' ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a `` cable release , '' i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .
0	bought the camera , charger and the kit as part of the deal . every thing looks good except the missing npf-50 battery . requested for a replacement . in the replacement kit also battery was missing . returned both the items . 59.99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item
1	this is a great camera- it 's so thin , and takes amazing pictures , even when the subject is moving . the best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind of lighting great quality . i suggest this to anyone
0	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water , but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out . i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter . the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures
1	i received this product in a timely manner . it was exactly what i needed . thank you
0	i bought this camera in the beginning of january . i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality . based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd . i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive , which is true . after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions , with and without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc . i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing . the picture quality of the fuji was very poor . colors were 'smeared ' but the main problem was noise . even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise , same with other colors ( rgb noise ) . i did n't check grey/black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying . what a disappointment . the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well , at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5 . this is really a great camera , i must admit . the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good . i can only recommend sony 's h5 , even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd . what i liked about the f31fd was its size , its responsiveness and the monitor and menu . however , if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help
0	this kit is just junk . the deluxe blower brush is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size . there is a tweezers that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras . there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution . the lintless cleaning cloth is an about 3 x 5 piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away . this kit is not worth buying at any price , because it 's not worth the shipping charges
1	i 've had my d70s for about a year now , have n't regretted it for a second . the controls are laid out logically , with everything to hand . the dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate . i personally love the optional grid overlay , i have no excuses for horizons that are n't horizontal . the wireless flash system is great , though you have to buy an sb-600 or sb-800 to get the full benefit . this camera is bigger and heavier than the d50 and d80 , which in my opinion is a positive thing .
0	after a week the cammera did not work . the shop has a return police , but they did not send a ra number needed to return the item . they asked me an adress in the usa , and whwn i sent it they did nor answered . in my country , argentina , the local distributor said the garantee is not valid for them
1	i have looked everywhere for this charger . everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work . it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera . it 's just the right size and plugs right into the wall . the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag . thanks so much for having this item available
0	i really like the size and weight of the camera . it is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good . i had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable . i recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable , even outdoors . all the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on . i will spend a bit more money and get the sony hcr-dc96 instead
1	this is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size . we bought it to replace our bulkier sony dsc-f707 . the large screen is wonderful ! the video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video . the battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left . the main downside with this camera is the flash . it does n't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots . if it were n't for the flash , i would have given this a rating of 5 stars . this is overall a good camera . for more serious digital photography , we prefer to use the sony dsc-f707 as it has a better flash and zoom . however , it is too bulky to carry around
0	the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf ' format , not mpeg-4 . i bought one from 'egghead.com ' . after 30 days , i contacted aiptek to tell them the problem , they acknowledged that the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf ' format . they said there is nothing they will do about it . do not buy this product . aiptek advertises that the is-dv records video in mpeg-4 format , but it does n't . 'egghead.com ' wo n't deal with me because they say i should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
0	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one ... ... ... .do n't think so since i got copy ... ... .poor customer service all around ... ..
1	i 'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is `` much better '' than another , but for my canon ef-s 10-22mm on a 20d , i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded `` canon . '' it fits fine , does n't interfere with the lens hood , looks clear , seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all , protects the front element . what more would one want
0	this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .
0	we returned this video camera due to video picture quality . the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video , even after changing settings , the video had a `` grainy '' look . we just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work , but the picture was worse than our previous camera . purchased the pv-gs65 , next model up with 3ccd 's and love this model . as a matter a fact we still had the gs-31 , used the same tape , shot the same footage , and reviewing the two different shots , the gs-65 did 100 % better . the camera has a great feel in your hand , although the menu button can be difficult to press
0	i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it . for a point and shoot it is bad , it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot . it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings . while i enjoy some of them , most of the time my pictures turn out grainy ( in low light ) , whitewashed ( with flash ) or blurry ( of even slowly moving objects ) . i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things , but i rarely get a good picture when i need it . i never had these problems with my elph s200 . this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well , and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on . if given the option i would not buy this camera again
1	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 ? i ca n't believe the price . i am struggling btwn buying the sony brand battery and the compatible ones
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos . we promptly sent it back for a refund . i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !
0	one of the most disastrous purchases we 've ever made . it works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer . do n't bother trying to consult the instruction guide ; it 's the worst one you 've ever seen . you could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need , but they 're not actually on the website . definitely find another brand
1	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop . the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 , it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily .
1	the other day i used a friend 's standard digital camera for a little while . the whole time i found myself missing the manual zoom , instant response and convient manual buttons on my d50 . this camera takes amazing pictures . as an dslr beginner i used the camera in auto mode for the first several weeks , now after reading some books on photography i 'm slowing starting to use the manual features . the d50 lets me choose the level of control that i 'm comfortable with , from full manual to full automatic ; and both options are just a turn of the dial away . the body of this camera is built like a tank . metal and high quality plastics abound . the buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable . it is a beautiful piece of precision engineering
0	this is a nice looking brown suede camera case . based on all the stylus models listed , i assumed my olympic stylus 595 would fit in it but , unfortunately , it does not .
1	i dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and wo n't close . after some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place , i finally was able to close the lens . besides that , it is an awesome camera . i am able to pick out a color ( ex . red ) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white . no photoshop needed
1	i do not trust any batteries except canon for my canon cameras . i have found `` compatible '' batteries do not always charge in canon charger , and do not last as long on camera
1	i purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website . i had been using a nikon coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years . we plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos , but for now , this camera is an excellent investment . easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad , but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena . i 've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos ... i 'm really surprised . i began using ours after i had my son , so many photos were taken without a tripod , one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos ... and none of the images turned out blurry . i have taken a few photos of my son now that he 's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my nikon but turn out crystal clear on the sony . the movie mode is a real plus . i 'm actually on this page today because i 'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind . we have a digital video camera , but with plenty of 1g memory cards in hand , i 'd rather record action with this camera -- the quality and sound are worlds better . this is a lovely little low-cost camera that 's suitable for a wide range of users . i love it
0	up to you , but i would buy a generic branded battery of the same type ( lithium bp522 ) . i bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $ 50
1	i enjoy all the features of this item . the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure . you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off . the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear . the slot for memory cards 1-4 ( depends on the card type ) , batteries ( roomy for four aa ) , and cables can fit in it . the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy . it 's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good . the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width . it can even handle the worst environment ever . hot , dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops . it has protected my dig . camera very well
0	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
0	i bought this camcorder 3 months ago and , after using it a grand total of 6 times , it is broken . it constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes ( two minutes on the counter in the display ) , refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full . it 's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes ? ? ? i figured that was a problem with the tape so i tried another one , which seemed to work fine until i got home and tried to watch the footage . the camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up . i had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where i needed it to be . lastly , the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month . one last note , the support for panasonic is horrible too . you ca n't talk to a `` real '' person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization `` person '' . i 'll never buy another panasonic product again ... give me sony
0	i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera . it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase , the flash stopped working . the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light . i would not recommend this camera .
0	i bought this camera in oct 2005 . i brought it everywhere . loved it . in april 2006 , the lcd screen blew . canon replaced it with a refurbished camera . in march 2007 , the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $ 97.00 , as they have determined this is the result of impact damage . how they determine this is unclear to me , as it was not dropped or impacted ... apparently , you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera . that , to me , is the hallmark of a faulty product . unfortunate - as i really loved this camera
1	i bought this for my mother ... she loves it ! its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view . the print quality is excellent . i got more ( merchandise and quality ) with this hp brand than i would had with any other brand . the price was excellent too . good job hewlett packard for making me a `` smart '' person
0	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great . but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead . this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i 'm going to europe ( two days after it died ) . now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off . grrrrr ! !
1	the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus , especially where there is not adequate light . aside from this it is a good but not great lens . it is probably worth the money that it cost , however , i believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens
1	great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack , but beware . .. . this camera does not come with a lens cap , and no remote control . other sources state that this camera does not have a leica lens . this camera does not have a/v input . no flash , no hot accessory shoe ( though it has one which has no power ) . no widescreen lcd . it does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen .
1	this is a great lens for any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this is easily correctable with software . in addition , the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus . i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )
1	i love this battery charger ! i used to use store bought aa batteries for my olympus digital camera , but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week , the batteries were drained of power . for some reason , this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if i am just storing my camera . highly recommended
1	i purchased this camera case for the kodak z650 . this case is perfect for the kodak z650 . it looks and feels like a high quality camera case and does allow for the storage of an sd card or two . i 'm very happy with this purchase
0	i had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course . after a lot of research , i settled on the pro tour laser . as previous reviewers have stated , this unit is very hard to stabilize . i have a feeling this is true of all lasers . even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car i found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present . on the golf course , finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping . this unit has been returned and i have gone to a standard handheld gps instead . once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint , this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage , you just have to convert feet or 1/100 's of a mile into yards . i do this with a chart taped on the back of the gps . accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper . i am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles .
1	i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 mark i ( the version with the metal mount and distance scale ) that i purchased recently . canon specs the discontinued es-65 hood for this lens . the great thing about this et-65iii is that it is longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked , providing a bit more light absorption . i 've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college , but this hood is definitely worth the investment : well built , fits backward on the lens for storage ( but too long while the lens is on the camera ) , and provides good protection for the front of the lens ( it 's quite deep ) . note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount with no distance scale )
1	this battery for my cannon camera is a great little `` back up '' battery . my camera came with a cannon battery and charging unit . the replacement cannon battery sells for over $ 40.00 so purchasing this cta battery at less than $ 10.00 is a very good choice .
1	pros : - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light . - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches . - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall . better to break the hood than the front element . - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you . cons : - will increase lens movement in windy situations , kind of like a sail on a boat . - takes up more room in your bag , even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens . - people take more notice of you , will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile
1	i am very happy with this set of filters . the price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite , camera and filters
1	i am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera . occaisionally when i turn it on the lense doies n't slide out , which is a little disconcerting . however , if i tap it , or turn it off and turn it o n again , it comes out to the operational position . i enjoy using it , amd would n't hesitate to purchase another one
1	getting great pictures from this new flash for my sony digital slr camera
1	this was a great addition to the `` photography basket '' i made my grandson for easter
1	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field , it does not appear on the lcd , you can only see it through the viewfinder . this is different from previous models . minor annoyance . the quality of the videos was surprisingly good , but it saves them in the quicktime .mov format . mov is not my favorite format , but perhaps others will not be bothered by this . although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural , i have found it to be excellent . the overall quality of the pictures is good . for the price , i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers .
0	this camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures . i bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it ( she 's happy with anything pink ) i was very disappointed at the quality and functionality
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame . i returned it
1	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature . that takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features ( such as fader effects ) while filming . the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer . all in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to
1	i purchased the canon off camera shoe cord to use with the canon ex 580 for weddings . i needed the cord to use the flash on a braket to avoid red eye . it does what it 's supposed to . no complaints .
0	this is not at all suitable for young children . it 's awkward and difficult to use . we 're sending it back . totally inappropriate for children
0	i recently purchased the g600 printer dock and have n't even gotten to try it out yet -- the print cartridge that came with it did n't work . i ordered another and inserted it and it still does n't work . it constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced . lots of time and money involved in this mess -- -stick with hp !
1	this bag is great for your slr digtial camera . it has space for your extra lens . everything that came with you slr camera fits in this bag . this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive
0	grainy iso 100 pictures at any light conditions . usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem , but if you take pictures with panasonic dmc-fz7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera . i had panasonic dmc-fz7 and the only cons . is really noisy high iso sensitivity mode . in fz8 camera panasonic implemented the venus iii processor ( fz7 has venus ii processor ) . as a result picture quality really improved at high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed for the worse in iso 100 mode
1	isiklandirmanin iyi olmadigi yerlerde netlik sorunu oluyor . birde floresan isik altinda beyaz dengesi tam tutmuyor . diger ozellikleri gayet guzel . bellek kartina cekim yapabiliyor olmasi cok guzel
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt -- there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at '34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .
1	through most of the 1990s , i lived overseas in both europe and asia . unfortunately , my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a `` tourist '' with my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend 's t1 and being impressed with the size of it . the t7 is obviously considerably smaller , which is even better ! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $ 400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro . both are investments that even to this day ( over a year later ) i am very happy with . i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it . i can say i 've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes . as far as size , that is the biggest plus to it 's advantage . it can fit anywhere . even with the optional case that you can buy for it , it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket , without even a noticable bulge . as far as photo quality goes , as most of the reviews note , the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots . i 've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you 'll get , but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash , what can you expect ? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera , i know what will be a good and bad night shot , and with the playback feature , you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed . is it perfect ? no , but that 's super tough in a camera this small . some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still . i 've never had issue with this , but i could see how it could be an issue , it 's just never one either my wife ( the primary user ) or i have dealt with . i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem . i 've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger ( and more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i have been very pleased with that . another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it . i put a plastic screen protector ( the thin plastic sheet type held by static ) on it as soon as i bought it and have n't had a problem . i 've sat on the camera before ( by accident , of course ! ) and have had it in luggage and the like , but have never had a problem . the most significant drawback that i 've had with the camera is that it can take more photos ( esp with the 1gb card ) than the battery will last . buy a second battery and you 'll be more than good , but it 's just something to keep in mind . i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels , or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos . it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots , it 's all that you need . i can say that we have many photos of our kids ( and really good ones , too ) that we would never had gotten if my wife did n't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag ! i 'm happy enough with it that i 'm going to buy a second one for myself ( especially now that the prices have dropped so much ! ) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography . i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others
1	for the price paid , this is a great camera . should last me for a long time . debated buying a slr , but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr ( actually it is a slr , just no interchangable lenses ) and a lot easier to use
0	this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true ! i brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies . but i was sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures and videos . the only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that i had no need for . after about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better i gave up and sold it on ebay for the same price as i brought it for . it 's a great idea ... but it just is n't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice . the mp3 player is n't all that wonderful either . it does n't work with itunes . or easy work with windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would have read this before i brought this camera
0	my kids can see better through a toilet paper roll than this `` telescope . '' meaning , you ca n't see a freaking thing through it . do n't waste your money
0	i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review . it 's lightweight but sturdy , easy to assemble and disassemble , and very adjustable . i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted , like a short tripod , and it was wonderful . it 's also nicely finished , and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs , it stays together and does n't flop around while you 're toting it . unfortunately , that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder , and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder , i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera ! to my great relief , i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble , but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes . i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod , so this is not `` consumer error . '' ( i ca n't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then i ca n't dock the camcorder ... bad on sony there ... but still . ) your mileage may vary , but this tripod is going back to amazon , and i 'll be shopping for another brand .
1	i 've been using 35mm slr cameras for over 30 years . for the last 9 or 10 years i have gone through several under $ 400 digital cameras as the technology has improved . this kodak z710 is a very economical compromise . the built-in 10x optical zoom is a great feature . the z710 does not have image stabilization ( is ) as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it ( and the whole camera ! ) that 's not really a problem . another feature of this camera that i really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot . check out the kodak web site for more information on this . i bought this camera from an amazon dealer for less than $ 200 shipped to me . that 's cheaper than a reconditioned unit ( same model ! ) recently sold on ebay
0	bought this camera for my wife . takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution . if you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill . fuji customer relations is sub-par . warranty does not cover any impact internal damage . i 've had better luck with nikon and kodak and will steer clear of fuji in the future
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert . i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that - but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus , now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife
0	did not get kodak max , instead recieved regular kodak crv3 battery . i thought i was ordering a better version , seller needs to change misleading picture !
1	i won the kodak printer at a scrapbook convention then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price . purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest beat out anything i could find in the local stores . it is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store 's website , wait a few days , go there pick it up , etc . great value
1	works as great as orignal battery . you will never know the difference except that is a lot cheaper !
0	this cable did not fit my camera as stated . because of the cost factor , i chose not to return it . the shipping was more than the cable was worth
0	this camera took some great pictures , and i enjoyed it 's size and functionality for several months . i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated . the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass . the end . the lens assembly is shot , according to my local camera store , not economical to fix . this was about the softest fall a camera could take , and not work , it was like landing on a pillow . i will not buy hp cameras again
1	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price
1	it 's great . nice top storage for memory cards and extra battery . compact . perfect for camera size .
1	i mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids . i bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago . i had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which i returned to buy the canon camcorder . the high light performance of both camcorders are excellent . with the sony camcorder , i felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity . the low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format . this is the main reason that i prefer the canon . the 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion . the still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony . this is especially true when taking flash pictures . the sony seems a little better built . the hdmi cover on canon is poorly built . i liked the controls on canon better than sony . the auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony . the auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light . sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not . sony has more manual controls than canon . [ ...
1	my sony fx1 has great low light capability , 3 lux , but eventually you will need extra light . using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess , no matter which camera you use . i 'm so glad i bought it . used it for my birthday party . though the overhead light was good , dark corners of the room require more light . if you consider yourself advanced , semi-pro , or a pro videographer , you must have a light . my only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts . no variable for 5 , or 15 . it is worth getting a long life battery like the np-970 . independent power source ( battery ) is a plus . but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of
1	i do n't like pink so i bought the blue bag . i had bought a black one , but it was so skimpy i returned it and prayed until this one arrived . i had no trouble with amazon crediting me for the return , either . it was so cute ! i 'm too old for `` cute , '' but i kept it because i needed a case for my new hp r717 . it is small , yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it . i have dropped my camera and it was not injured . it has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera , not the big aa batteries , but the flat type that come with my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or the pink one , even if you do n't like pink ... or blue . they are well cushioned and snug , but not too snug you think they will tear . the are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures
0	here is the short version . oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $ 299.99 . nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright/dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm 's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~ $ 300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $ 70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $ 85.95 ( i spent $ 16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $ 102.47 for the repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse . and that i do n't think that it makes sense for me to pay $ 100 to repair a $ 300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired . the service rep , named christina , asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate . now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera , its memory card , and the shipping i paid .
0	i have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime i use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds . i returned my camcorder and got another one ( pvgs65 ) and i am still having this problem . everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus . if anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review . brandonwg8677 @ comcast.net thank you
0	i purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with hewlett packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my r818 camera ( the dock has a thin port , roughly 10 connectors ) while the r818 has a mini usb plug ) . hp was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter , getting a different answer each time i spoke to a different rep ( even being told at one point that no supervisors were working ) . i was finally able to get someone willing to send me one , but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it , which by then i 'll be on vacation ( and i purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter , thinking it was not hard to get ) . i was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation . i would definately *not* recommend this if you have the photosmart r818 digital camera , unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with hewlett packard trying to get a correct part , and waiting 10+ business days to get it
1	have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting , at sporting events ( indoor and outdoor ) and at concerts . fast focusing and great image stabilization ( is does use quite a bit more power , though ) . have not had one problem with it . solid build and has a little heft to it . it is a bit pricey , but i chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market . would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens .
0	my husband bought me this camera for my birthday in may 2006 . i loved this camera . well , it stopped working on christmas eve . i used it that morning with no problems , put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening . when i removed the camera that evening , the screen remained black . it would not take any pictures . after talking with the customer service folks , i sent my camera in for repair . it was under warranty , and i had not done anything to break the camera . well , they voided my warranty stating that it was `` impact damage '' and my repair bill was $ 111.00 . you have got to be kidding . i called to question the voided warranty since i had not dropped the camera . the technician i spoke to explained that `` impact damage '' could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse . so i asked to speak to a manager . i am sorry , but if i am going to spend this much money on a camera , i expect a little better quality . i have called and email the kodak company several times to have someone talk to me . nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails . i would seriously think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera . i have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it .
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera . followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail . it appears that this remote is defective
1	if you have the big lenses ( 400mm f/2.8l is usm or even the 70-200mm f/2.8l is usm ) this is totally worth the addition . the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges . check compatability on canon 's website . you wo n't be disappointed
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today , but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact . i 'm sure it takes nice pictures , but a lot of cameras take nice pictures . i have to go where the service will at least respect you .
0	beware of this camera ! the camera overall works great . we have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear , bright pictures and is very easy to use . very nice compact size . however , as others have pointed out , the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again . there is no battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced . we were warned about this so i thought , no problem , i 'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed . but what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now , they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed . i had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon .
0	watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i
0	at least if your going to decieve people about the lcd screen in the back , at least make the picture quality decent . i mean this barely qualifies as a picture . some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light . this was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when i had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures . definatly stay away from this camera
1	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera , which is bulky . this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket . it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price . the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding . inside pics were a bit pixelated , but i may have had the settings wrong . the camera is easy to use right out of the box . perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case
1	this was the best item i ever bought for my camera . i do a lot of walking with my camera , and thought i would use it as a walking stick , which i do , but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen . my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear . i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera . the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths . the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched
1	the lens adaptor threads on very easily and i 've not seen any loss in color or light from using this filter
0	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
0	the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you can not get to ... and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me ... '' well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally '' when asked about the stuff on the inside . `` that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens '' i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
1	i believe this is one of the best lens for about $ 1000 . forget about zoom lenses even if they are l. this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5 . with zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135/2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm/1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated `` in stock soon '' . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5 . very fast lens with f/2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d/20d/rebel/300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait
0	i bought this battery in july 2004 . i charged it as soon as i got it . i put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later . the battery was dead . so i charged it again and put it in the camera again . i used it and it seemed to work fine . but the next time i went to use the camera ( approximately 2 weeks to a month later . ) it was dead again . as i write this review i am sitting in a hotel room in prague . i charged the battery ten days ago . i used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures ( did not use the flash ) . i then used it again today . i was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead ( did not use the flash ) . i bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory . so now i have to charge the battery everytime i use the camera . this was a big disappointment . i get better life out of the standard duracell alkalines . it appears that this technology has n't been perfected or that belkin has not perfected their quality control . beware when buying this product
0	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine . when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images , i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift . perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution , but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels . i would not recommend this item at all
1	price went up ! ! ! great value for money spent . will be buying a `` ball '' attachment for better adjustability . got some great steady shots with 48x digital zoom with the canon s2 i
1	this is one of the four cameras , the only digital camera , i used to learn portrait photography . the class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera . i wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because i wanted an slr film camera also . i got the canon rebel ti packed with two lenses . it made sense to me to purchase a canon digital to interchange lenses . my original choice was the canon digital rebel , however , in my web search , i found the eos 10d for $ 750 with no catch . there were no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me to spend the extra money i would have spent on the camera on accessories . since it 's digital , i am not shy about trying out the features . when i first got the camera , some of the photos were dark or very light . after tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means i do n't get that anymore . the 10d is more camera than i need that i 'm sure i will have it for a long time .
0	i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option
0	i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1.3mp digital camera binocular . the first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures , the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable , the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box . a truely tatty product
1	i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind -- 1.4x is only `` 40 % better '' . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want -- i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage
1	this is n't a full review but some thoughts i 've had after using it for a long time . stabilization- the fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you , you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash . if flash does n't bother you , no sweat . but i 've never like the look of it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all the time . it would be nice if it had a pause button because without it i end up with many small files . ex- this is where you set the exposure . casio does a great job putting everything in one place . the only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection ( e.g . iso 200 to 400 ) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot . instead nothing happens . you have to click set first . it 's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert . i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that - but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus , now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife
0	i have to agree with the other reviews of this scope . i purchased this scope as a christmas gift . when i opened it , the equatorial mount ( the basis for the entire scope ) was broken . i contacted celestron and was promised another part for it , which never arrived . i contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me . it did n't fit . finally , i was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope . the equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah ! too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and i could not assemble this one . i even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support ( who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived ) and all i got was a bunch of excuses . i finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one entire telescope . it 's february and i just now have a product that works . ( i have n't had time to try it though ! ) celestron offered no refunds for this telescope , so buyer beware . if they are not willing to satisfy customers , your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells . good luck
0	i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants ( what i do most ) and its manual focus is difficult ( very difficult ) to use . my much cheaper , and lower resolution , old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions . i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus . in addition , photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card . do n't buy this camera
0	bought the camera on a recommendation , and also what looked like good specs on the web . owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked ( below the surface of the protective cover ) . turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras . panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one , or own one , be very careful not to use the left nav button . if you do , be very careful on the pressure you apply . this is the camera 's glass jaw , and you might end up `` bricking '' a brand new camera . i am replacing mine with a canon
0	if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that ? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp . ok , so maybe video ? ok , but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage ? cant edit it without a lot of work . ( where is the firewire port , or even the ability to edit an mpg file ? ) geeez.. anyway.. i am taking mine back . it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it..
1	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased . the pictures are wonderful . the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do . the slideshow feature is wonderful as well . everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed . to be sure , they are expensive but worth the cost . we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly . thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right .
0	i purchased , through work , the powershot s70 in july of 2005 . i 've always owned nikon products personally , but the features for the price of the s70 swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty . in the 12 months i 've had the s70 , it 's been sent to the factory twice for repairs -- the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired . the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track . eight months later , the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again ! the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np , so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning . now , the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open . i have no faith in the canon s70 and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole . the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks , which i thought was fast for warranty work
0	i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price ... like less the $ 15 shipped
0	this bag is very small . my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens , but you can not fit more than one lens with the camera body . we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag
1	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf-10 when this case was on back order . it was terrrible , so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased . the camera fits perfectly into the case and , although it is described as a `` soft case , '' it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk
0	i bougt this camera and a olymus camera , both in the same price range , the kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship . avoid this at all cost the olympus was well made , durable , higher quality picture and ease of use
1	thes item is gretes item i used befoer for these prise ! ! yes is true is very clear optics , you can see in total darknes about 350 m it 's agood rand , price and qulity .
0	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost . you truly get what you pay for , and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel . i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm ( 480mm on a digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want to make an enlargement from it . stay away . do n't believe the fools who are novices , you will be disappointed with this lens . you 're much better off to buy the older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( the l version costs more too ) but both are so much better than this junker . you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld . having switched from nikon when switching to digital , i almost judged canon from this one lens , which i 'm glad i did n't . do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did . this lens also had terrible purple fringing , almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm . after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses : canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version ) canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it . the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens .
1	this is a good battery and lasts for a long time . good value
1	i so love the size and shape of this camera . this one takes some good pictures , and appear to be quite clear . it 's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone . this camera may seem like it 's taken a poor quality image , but when you transfer them onto a pc , they seem so clear ! however it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory . as this camera was a gift to me , i 'd have to say it was the best birthday present i have received
1	picked mine up used on ebay for $ 180 . with the growth of the vr market everyone is dumping there old lenses . you can get a used one for a great price . this lens is great for the serious amatuer . i have taken some incredible pictures with this lens . the autofocus is a little slow and i have heard people complain about softness on the high end but i have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my d70 at 300mm . of course i shoot the photo on a tripod ... . i have not experienced the softnes
0	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
0	it was suggested by amazon.com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera . not knowing any better , i bought it . it does n't even work with this model camera . i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store bypassed the need for an adapter altogether
0	offers no eye comfort whatsoever . magnification is very weak . stick to original eye cu
1	the battery works as specified , the pricing was excellent and the order came in very timely . i 'm completely satisfied with this product and vendor
0	this microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the sony hdr-hc7 video camera on most websites , including sonystyle . while the microphone may be of good quality ( i did n't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it ) , it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the hdr-hc7 . the microphone does plug into the mic jack on the camera and appears to work , but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera . ( note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back , at which point it 's probably too late to make a correction . ) after nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and , finally , direct conversation with a sony technician , i learned that there is a `` jury-rigged '' bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod . otherwise , there is no way to fix it to the camera . the sony technician finally admitted that it was `` curious '' that sony lists this as a compatible microphone . if you have a sony hdr-hc7 , choose a different microphone !
1	this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon ... you lose a star for that
0	as an owner of the sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam , i want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line . design and feature-wise , these handicams are great . the problem is , they are built like junk . from the day i opened my box , i got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned . in retrospect , i should have returned it for a replacement then and there . but being a basically optimistic guy , i decided it just got dirty in transit , and i got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads . it worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in sony 's crappy labor warranty . and from that point forward , i have gotten dirty head messages constantly , which at first could be `cleaned away , ' but now , even when the message is gone , problems persist . i often get bars across the screen during playback , and i have already determined that i have lost many a precious memory of my infant children . sony 's solution to this situation is their standard `` flat rate '' repair program , truly a bargain for $ 250 or so - more than half what i paid for the camera in the first place . and sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared ? they are just another electronics brand now , and one with sub-par quality and service at that . guess i 'll be buying samsungs or canons next time around . are you listening , sony ?
1	this battery is backwards compatible with the d50 , d70/70s , and is used in the d80 and d200 . so if you have any nikon dslr and want a second battery , you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery . this battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery , and it is accurate . this is a big deal ; *if you are using the d200 or d80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up . this is the first battery i 've seen that is accurate in this regard . kudos to nikon . ( this feature does not work in the d50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine )
0	even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , and even though i had to return it because it was too small , and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer 's review , amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera . to add insult to injury , amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault . ( it took two emails to get the full refund , and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh ! ) regarding the bag itself , construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories
0	this is a poor excuse for a lens coming from canon . can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo . please do not waste your money like i did
0	i bought the camera in may of 2006 , as a graduation gift for my son . he loved the style and compactness . he experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use . unfortunately he did n't start to use the gift for 2 months or i might have been able to return to amazon for a refund . contacting fufifilm has been overly cumbersome . their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive ( long waits ) . they have had the toy camera ( as this is being written ) for over a week and when i called yesterday for status , they told me that the camera `` has n't been diagnosed yet '' . i expect it will be , once their 90 day warranty expires , which will limit fujifilm 's liability to the 1 repair . i have a mean case of buyer 's remorse . i might as well have taken the ~ $ 235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street . if you own one and it does n't require repairs , you might like it . if it ever requires repairs , you might feel as i that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera . save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty , a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty . you may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired . i bought it in may of 2006 ... .i feel like i lost it in july of 2006 . if i could have given the z1 less then 1 star , i would have . that 's what it deserves ! ! % $ $ # # 444en fujifil
1	i bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball . my other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor . i have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well . what i just started playing with , and i love is the video feature . it is so easy to use and the images are better than i expected . i bought this camera in december as a present to myself and i have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice . this is major to me as my nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon . the optical zoom is clean , but the digital is definitely noisy . i have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and i do n't miss the shot .
0	cons only , no pros : the velcro closure is week and opens easily terrible look the side zippers are a mistery , totally useless no space for extra memory or battery attaches only to a very small belt the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash
0	far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc . works fine though .
0	i have had several people take my pictures.at first , everything is fine.the pictures are ok.the next day , my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.it is soooo blury.then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury.i tried fixing it online ( like on the program for the camera ) and it would not work.i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks.it lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.this camera should be $ 99.00.trust me people ... ... if i could rate this thing at a zero i would.it is not worth it.however , a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5.an awesome little camera
1	excellent ! they have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables
1	when i had seen this camera on net , i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small handy ... except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always , its a great camera ... the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it ...
0	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
0	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box . it takes the output of the camcorder ( composite/rca or s-video ) and compresses that to mpeg-2 ( dvd ) or mpeg-4 ( or divx ) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd ( mpeg-1 or mini dvd ) . look for plextor 's m402u box . unless you really want to deal with 3.125 mb of data per second ( 25 mbps ) , or about 180 mb per minute , or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link , get the m402u . your options will be greatly expanded , and you wo n't tell the difference by looking
1	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry , based on my trial use of the vx2000 . that was three years ago . this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it . i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production , plus , i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system . the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible . now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church , i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves
0	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it was n't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !
0	if you purchase this lens adapter for the xacti hd1a , you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash . the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos
0	try to call panasonic customer service @ 1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first . panasonic service is the worst one in this world .
1	i bought this camera to replace a 3mp kodak cx series when i thought i had lost it . my 3mp took great pics and i never had any problems with it and i did n't want to have to learn to use a different brands software . the kodak easyshare software did n't impress me much when i bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better . the kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files . i have n't used the c533 a lot since i bought it but the pics i 've taken have come out great . but just like the other reviews state , slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries . however , if you spend the extra money for the lithium batteries you 'll get much improved battery life . all in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person
1	of course , it had to be kodak . no matter what people say , i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera , i 've found this camera to be a real warrior , last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better , photo cuality its very good and colors are great , no excesive blue or red in your pics , night photo taking its excelent in close shots . 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater , but its nothing a 25 $ batterie charger can`t solve . sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje
0	my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco . we put new batteries in that morning . the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset . when i tried to download the pictures to my computer , they were all gone , and the battery icon was flashing . based on what i 've read here , it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased . the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor , but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy . but what good is that when there are n't even any pictures the next day . i 'm hoping the store will take it back
1	i am pleased with the purchase . very good value . picture quality is good and it is easy to operate . only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic . however , it looks good . this is my second purchase of this product : one for myself and one as a gift
0	this is the worst camera i have ever owned in my life . i had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one ! i have taken this camera on 2 vacations now , and both times i brought along my olympus slr film camera , and both times , the olympus pictures are clearer , brighter and all but maybe 1 will work , with this stupid sony cybershot , i end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening , the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time , or in bright lighting . on the first vacation i went on with this camera , my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures , as did my olympus , on the second vacation i returned from today as i write this , i just downloaded my pictures , and deleted 2/3 's of them because they are so bad , the ones that came off my film camera are perfect ! my sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her , and as i went through her pictures , same thing over 2/3 's of them did n't work , i would have just assumed i 'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my sony that did not work , however hers did n't either , i would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem , however , i took a number of the exact same picture on this sony as well as my olympus ( as a back up and thank god i did ) and the pictures from the olympus , as well as every other camera i have ever used , have come out fantastic , on this camera though , they come out horrible , so bad in fact that i 'm embarrassed to show people ! believe me , if i had n't gotten it free as a present i 'd be writing a nasty letter to sony , as it is though my next camera i 'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment , therefore knows what they 're doing . sony makes great tv 's and home entertainment systems , anything else i 've bought from them , or known someone who has , has been junk , their camera , their car stereos , their computers ! sony should stick to tv 's and home theater , it 's what they 're good at , camera 's not so much , unless you 're looking for something cheap that you 'd only use in the day , even then i 'd recommend a disposable , they even work better than this camera
1	i have been using kodak cameras for years . this is my third kodak digital camera . it does everything , including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos . it is as easy to use as a point and shoot . however , it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera . it is well worth the money . look no further this is the camera for you
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
1	you wo n't go wrong with a panasonic dv . i 've had a few models . i have several of this model for my business . they 're rock solid reliable , nice and small for portability , and the quality of the recording is very goo
1	this product is good for its price . the mini tripod inside the switchgrip looks very good and holds my canon pro perfectly . the travel bag is also very useful
0	the worst thing for this is , you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing hd video . i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder . but a small disc can only hold 20 min hd video , have to change disc time by time . the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today . a lot of noise will come in low light condition ! i bought it for $ 800 and return it . i think you 'd better buy sr1 with a 30g hard drive . that would be a much better one !
1	i originally bought the edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often ( to leave at home ) . then i came across the edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly . not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet , i was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment . it needed to be easy to remove , but it also needed to be secure ; the pictures i found on the internet did n't show how it was attached . i was relieved when i actually saw how it was attached . there is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag ( an open slot is at each end ) . the add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro . the attachment method is secure and is almost invisable , and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag . i think the original bag is very good , and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice . unfortunately , you have to buy this as a combination . if you originally bought the 120 single bag version , it does n't have the slotted bottom on it and ca n't be retrofitted ( and i do n't think they sell the detachable bag separately )
1	i bought this camera around the beginning of july and have used it several times already . i 've upgrade from a nikon coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller , sleaker size and more megapixels . this camera takes excellent pictures , in broad daylight as well as in the dark . red eye reduction is wonderful , however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times . it 's not broken ... it 's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch . overall , i think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation !
0	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
1	i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version . overall i was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight . sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses , and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur . if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f/4 .
1	took some nice pictures underwater in cuba . pretty easy to use . worked fine at our depth ( ~8 meters , 24 feet ) . still waiting for the chance to use it at greater depths .
0	bought the camera on a recommendation , and also what looked like good specs on the web . owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked ( below the surface of the protective cover ) . turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras . panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one , or own one , be very careful not to use the left nav button . if you do , be very careful on the pressure you apply . this is the camera 's glass jaw , and you might end up `` bricking '' a brand new camera . i am replacing mine with a canon
0	product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery . as of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card . how would you rate my review
0	the article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears . the conector to the camera is not usb/fire wire , but it is a type nini stereo
1	yes this is a very good first camcorder . i am a first time user of any cam corder . i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting . but the software is harder to use that movie maker . but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use.. but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic . enjoy.. do
1	i had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the canon eos1 . as exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans . the wait was for 35mm film quality , with speed of picture taking ( 5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the eos 1 was desired ) . there was a parallel wait for an image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let 's cut the story short . if i want a camera to bring on holiday , it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky ; instead i would choose the eos20d without hesitation . but having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames i decided not to wait any longer but to buy the eos1d mark ii because the 1ds mark ii is not fast enough at 4 frames a second . with 35mm cameras , after a few seconds on the shooting , i would have to run back inside to the cabin ( of a ship ) to change film . if there is large enough memory card in the eos1dii , there is no need . this camera is built with seals against the environment ( and so does the 28-300mm lens ) . instead of being scared of running out of film , now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning ( and hoping ) the dolphins do their jumps into the air . with the 28-300mm lens attached , there is no need to change lenses either . dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting . it is a disappointment that the battery is not lion but the older nimh . but as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare , whatever the substance . i just wish canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky . it has connections for two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following the other ) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged . you just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ... ... .ext . hard disk ... .as hand luggage . for work , i am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware . but for holidays , i would choose the eos20d with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod ? the camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one of the beauties i had thought with digital slr was not having to do anything in processing , just transfer the images to the computer . wrong . the .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough . post processing is required . why ? why is that necessary when the canon s60 ( which i use for different assignments ( with underwater housing ) ) does n't need to ? that defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 meg when the 1.5 meg of the s60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? still , there is raw if the standard output is not suficient . incidentally , the eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg .jpg and those also require post processing . for those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem a bit wasted . i am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process , and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film . meantime i shall have to learn to shoot with raw files and post process . also incidentally , the sensor size of the eos20d is smaller , which means although itself is lighter than the eos1d series camera , having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday . the magnification ratio for the eos1dii is 1.3 whereas the eos20d is 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) with the 1dii and 28-135mm is lens attached . sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it is state of the technology at the moment . another benefit of using digital is that , it does n't matter if you had been shooting iso 100 all day . come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop , just change to iso 1600 without having to bother about `` pushing2 the film in developing . it 's a beauty when an is l lens is attached . you 'd need is when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! good job canon . now you need to shoe horn in a more capable cpu ( to process the images in-camera ) , fit the 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1dsii and you may persuade me to part with more cash .
0	i bought this camera in february , and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died , i could review the photos i had taken , but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd/efv , and only turned off when i removed batteries , i sent it to fuji repair center , and got it back again almost one month later . then six months later the camera did exactly same thing , i have n't received my camera back yet , but i 'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls
1	worked like a charm in my panasonic ag-dv30 video camera ! having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you 're on vacation and do n't want to mess with charging batteries or being `` selective '' in your shooting . this gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later . worth the money and a good deal here
0	this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1 . the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3 . the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4 . the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to `` shiver '' , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim `` konedog '' koenig , astronomy buf
0	loved the concept of this camera ... small , 10x zoom and sleek looking , but the first one lasted 3 days , had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week . both stopped operating completely . so given that kind of problem i do not recommend this camera
1	in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800 . - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ... and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the `` idiot modes '' ( i.e . `` portrait '' , `` landscape '' , etc . ) with modes that you could customize

1	seems a little much to pay for an `` extension cord '' but upon receipt i see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors . plus , its a brand item from canon , so what can you do

1	i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak and another canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything.. cons ... no audio on video i definetly recommend the product for the price
0	i ordered the sony dcr-dvd108 on april 9 . i still have n't received the camera . what i have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why . as far as i 'm concerned it is too late ! the first stated that the shipment would leave on april 16 . when i purchase the camera , i did so because the add stated that if i wanted the camera by april 12 , i needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes . this i did . the next e-mail that arrived just this morning and i 've been informed that it will arrive between april 26 and may 3 . i have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter 's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates , i 'll be missing 2 more . well , i 'm not missing 2 more and amazon is getting the camera back . the best part of this is that i do n't even have the option of canceling the order because amazon is and i quote , `` ... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order can not be canceled or changed . '' if you ca n't get the order out on time , you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet , try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost . i can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life .
1	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr 's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr 's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a `` wonderful '' new feature like `` low light or non-shake . '' this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...
0	i bought this item as a gift , and it ended up becoming mine . i have to say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here are some main issues i am having with the camera : 1 . it is very poorly designed . the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant . buttons are really ugly , and operating the camera is awkward , and for some functions requires both hands to operate.. 2 . the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally . 3 . the worst , by far , is the picture quality . colors are just plain terrible . automatic settings are a disaster of photography . i have used a canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . the canon was far superior in quality , colors , lighting.. i do n't need large files of trash , i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures . as a result , i am strongly recommending getting a different camera . i have had great experiences with canon ; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , and indeed many other devices .
1	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches . i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed . it is easy to use in fact , i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches . its f2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge . if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you .
0	two months . . .the amount of time in which i saved to purchase what i thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal . . . one week . . .to find that no matter what i tried i was utterly dissapointed . . . 1 ) no matter the setting every picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than i horrible blur . 2 ) the 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible . . .every person i try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90 % horrible family photos . i could go on but i wont . . .i cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money . . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon . . .because it is not worth it . i now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera
0	i purchased this item two weeks ago . my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced , perfect addition to the `` tools '' necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby ( its advertised contents , construction , and `` glow-in-the-dark '' planisphere ) . after closely examining the item for the past ten days , i 'm forced to conclude that i was in error , and that you really do get what you pay for . as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy , i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name . i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps . the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings , letter transpositions , apparent omitted words , and just plain ( what we used to call in the old days ) `` typographical errors . '' additionally , when i compare some of the technical information on the maps ( i.e. , star magnitudes , astronomical distances , etc . ) and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession , i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances . when using a product like this , it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains . since i 'm not able to do this , i must rate this item with one star . when i purchased the item , it was marked down by twenty percent . i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase , the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent . in this case , do n't be fooled ( as i was ) by an attractive price . avoid this product . ( i do n't have a substitute to recommend at this time . )
0	i am [ ... ] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card . 16 mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough ! read on ! if you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory . this is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible . ( because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card . ) looking further on p13 it states : `` choosing slideshow frequency note : this function applies to photos stored on all media . '' page 27 in faq states : `` 2 ) q : can i switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards ? a : yes . when you connect your memory card to photoframe ( tm ) , it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card . '' finally , the quick start guide faq states : `` q can i switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards ? a yes , digital photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected . '' clearly the three references i provide indicate that the dpf can operate slideshows from a media card . in reality slideshows from media cards does not work . philips how about a firmware upgrade ? i bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures . i was planning on sending preloaded cards to her . all she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on . ( mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets.. ) . do not buy this dpf for older , none computer savvy people . since media card can not be used , you have to use the internal memory for slideshows . the internal 16mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that 's it . it is also unclear the maximum size a file can be . i believe the internal memory converts the file to a dpf friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card . ( how is mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed ? ) why have media card slots if they are useless ? internal memory is way too small ! do not buy and save yourself the hassle .
0	at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f/11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f/4l . it 's a far superior lens
0	in my opinion this is not a marketable product . the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work . there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix . when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit . as for hd - possibly at high noon in the sahara , but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing .
1	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to . i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony . it works great had no problems so far . it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv .
0	like other reviewers , after careful research , i decided to purchase this product . it was affordable , received good reviews , and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range . when i received it in mail , i was quite happy : it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what i had expected . the screen was bright and very attractive . the problems started about three weeks following the purchase . first , the slideshow option ( the kind with music ) stopped working . whenever i pushed the slideshow button , the screen would completely freeze and i had to restart the unit in order to use any other function . i thought , no big deal , i would just exchange the frame for another one . my second unit arrived yesterday . this one , however , started having problems right out of the box . after about 5 minutes into the slideshow , the screen started flickering , than shaking , became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically . i played it two more times after that , each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow . it is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential ( big , bright screen ) ; unfortunately , the software is very buggy . i checked the portable usa website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix . i will have to return this unit again , this time for a refund . my assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box . however , i would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership
1	small and compact . let me see everyting i wanted to
0	i have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it . i bought this camera to replace another nikon coolpix that was stolen from my house . but this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use . i have always liked nikon cameras but the s9 just does n't make it . i can not use it outside because i can not see the lcd screen . sorry nikon but you blew it on this camera ! ! so i replaced it with a canon powershot a710 . what a difference in ease of use and ... it has a view finder . also my 1g memory card from rhe nikon fots in the new canon .
0	after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing . mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect , so maybe the motor was already fixed : - ) my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender . the zr 500 is ok in low light , but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it is n't to your liking . you can also adjust the focus too ! my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par . i 've made two practice dvd 's ( with firewire , no problem at all ) with this camera and like what i see . for those of you that have bad motornoise : try your video software to edit the noise out . power director has that feature . i am happy with this product , but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder . a great camcorder for beginners !
0	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
1	sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process . this case is very slim , compact , well made , and has a very luxurious feel to it . it completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the sony camera it is designed to hold
1	the camera is good . had it 1 week now . low light it works and produces fair results . bright light is much better . small and light weight . you must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no usb port on camera . there is the dc in and tv out on camera ( as well as the docking station ... just no usb ... why ? ) 30gb hard drive is plenty ... maybe too much . if you fill this up you are looking at 8 dvd 's and hours of transfer . the software is weak and conflicts with roxio 7.5 . roxio became unusable . roxio stinks anyway . found a simple program to burn after this ... ashampoo . plan on getting adobe premier elements , too . amazon had the best deal ... 89 less 30 mail in rebate from adobe . much better then the software in box . my first cam as we now have a cute baby . easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save .
1	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom . i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots . you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want . i really like it for most general quick shots , carry it wth me most of the time
0	this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away
1	the camera fits perfectly . the case is very stylish . best of all , its pink
0	after discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case , i did some more looking . what i ended up with was a pelican case . for those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop , and they most likely carry them . they come in many sizes and are simply an airtight , waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches . the inside is solid soft foam that you pluck to fit what ever you want to store in the case . i purchased the 1300 for my finepix 3800 . the case easily holds the camera , battery charger , mini tripod , and 3 xd cards . they come in 4 or 5 colors , and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage
1	this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon ... you lose a star for that
0	i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the `` ancient '' sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8 . if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250 . if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality
0	i have been searching reviews of the nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and i am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem , and many have taken it up with nikon only to be told 'sorry ' . in a nutshell , i am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new slr models . i purchased the nikon coolpix s7c for my wife , and it is by far the worst one i have owned for many reasons , but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is horrible pictures . the 'electronic vr ' is simply digital image sharpening , the iso adjustments in low light are terrible , and what i simply can not believe is how terrible the autofocus is . couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily , and you literally end up getting more than 50 % blurry pictures
0	this is a terrible product : 1 . the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use . 2 . the pictures are extremely poor . 3 . the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient . w
1	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful , esp . with macro shots . highly recommend
0	the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time , an number or not the same , an it , s not the same battery . do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
1	i am very pleased with this camera . i especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure . i am using this for my photo class and is easy to use
0	have had an olympus 4.0m.for 4 years and been very happy with it . as a gift i got this canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness . shot about 600 pictures people were blurred , not crisp and dim even on a sunny day . had to return it.do n't bu
1	if you 're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors , you may have found what you 're looking for . the 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite as sharp ) . the main downside to this lens is that it 's big and heavy . i do n't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much , but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight . and it 's not exactly the sort of lens that i would want to toss into my backpack , just due to the immense size . if you do n't mind spending an extra $ 500 , consider also the 70-200/2.8 is ( image stabilization ) version of this lens . it weighs even more , but the built in is unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens
1	though being a nikonist for years and knowing the possibilities of that camera i could never imagine the results and performance of this item , easy to handle , incredible small for the capacity and giving the same options to get the same quality of pictures than the d80.i have both
1	when i first opened up the `` super quick charger '' i was a bit put off ... it 's small , it 's cheap looking ... compared to the old nicd charger i used to have it was very unimpressive . then i plugged it in . say what you will about this barebones solution , it works amazingly well . it charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges . it does exactly what i was looking for . if i could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots . while it 's not essential to the process by any means , it would look a lot better , and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid-charge by a curious cat .
1	very easy to install ; great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera ; would recommend to anybody
1	i am extremely happy with this purchase ! i love the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids
0	i purchased this for my wife for valentine 's day . the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device . first , the software to do the picture transfers is awful . you can only select pictures on your computer to download - you ca n't see what photos are on the device in the software . in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself . i checked the webpage for updated software - no joy . the crop feature is nice ( and well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows 3.1 application . second , the image quality on the device is very poor . i did n't have very high expectations , but this was lower than i expected . reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens , maybe a bit worse . you can make out the picture , but not much detail at all . the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea , it 's the only way to get a decent picture . overall , i 'm a little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay for..
1	kodak v705 black : small , can carry in pocket . wide angle lens , great for group photos . fast start up time . video mode is easy , built in mic picks up all the sounds.camera can stitch 3 photos together-great for vistas . i am happy with this camera . bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it.kodak makes easy to take photos . weak flash- try not to be more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop on photos
1	the new nikon en-el3e battery is a slight update for the nikon en-el3 provided with earlier dslr models such as the d70 . it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery . the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en-el3 . the en-el3e is backwards compatible with the en-el3 : you can put it in your d70 or d50 . the reverse is not true . the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , and of course , camera . ( the 2.5 '' lcd on the d200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller d70 . ) it is sufficient for a day of shooting . unless you are using a d200 in some professional capacity , in which case , you 'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery
0	i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating . i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning . not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light . i 'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers . i 've read that it has much better shutter speed . recommended ? ?
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon . it was , in my opinion , not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was . i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i 'm not satisfied . in this case i did not have time to find another camera case . thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion . linda sutto
1	i would like to add to the reviews already posted , especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 vr . this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens , but have not been able to bring myself to do it . the 80-400 is 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , and has yet to be updated with vrii technology . all that , and it still costs more than the pro-quality canon 100-400 is , which has canon 's af-s equivalent too ! that said , i like long yet portable lenses , and after giving myself fits decided to `` settle '' for the 70-300 because it has vrii and af-s . if you are in the same boat then buy this lens , it is a gem for its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open at 300 , and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures . i would have loved this lens if it was an f/3.5 , but even at 4.5-5.6 i have really been surprised at the results . save the $ 1000+ until nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur
0	i will start off by saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when the alpha came out i could n't wait to get one . it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america . amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days . i 've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony . most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one another . when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck with a lemon , and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera . i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews . other people have had problems with the camera , i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners ' dud cameras were unusual . if you decide to purchase anyway , i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon , but through a real store with a good and fair return policy , that stands behine their products . places like microcenter will exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon was $ 100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them . lesson learned on electronics .
1	this is something you will really need to keep you camcorder save and sound . defenitely worth the money
1	i bought this camera for myself at christmas . it is my first digital camera purchase . i love the clarity of the pics . i love the shutter speed ! i do wish the lens cap would stay on better , but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera .
0	nice looking . good quality . but the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out .
0	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great , but then i realized it would only display 142 images . i worked with technical support for several months ( they are not the speediest or most helpful ) . i resized , renamed , restructured the photos , tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug . i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course , only to recieve another with the same problem . i would n't recommend this purchase
1	i 've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best i think , i shots very quick , flash is brighty , and even soft flash for more natural shots . can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera , is light tiny and slim . one of the best cameras . i do n't find a negative feature on it . i love it
0	pictures do not come out very good . poor quality ! i would not recommend it
1	for $ 14.00 , you should get this sleek little package to protect your camera and battery/accessories . if you 've ever accidentally dropped an expensive camera , you know just what i 'm talking about . it 's nice looking as well
0	be careful ordering this item - make sure it 's the right one for your camera . while it says it 's for the a95 , it is n't . while it does n't say in the header that it 's the la-dc52c , it is , and the a95 camera requires the la-dc52d . i had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one . i purchased the wrong one based on amazon 's direction when purchasing accessories and do n't want others to make the same mistake
1	i am starting my career as a professional photographer , and i have n't had any problems with these filters . they come in a nice case , and are easy to attach to my lenses .
1	reasons to buy it : 1 . cheap , a mere $ 140 . 2 . packed with features . from complete auto mode ( point and shoot ) to fully manual mode . 4mp and 3x optical zoom good enough for most situations . 3 . picture quality is good . it 's better than the other two cameras i own ( olympus c720 uz and sony dsc s600 ) . 4 . compact . it 's smaller than it looks in the stock photo . 5 . fast . switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds . other things i liked about the camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely in my hand , all the buttons are well placed and easy to access . i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand . - powerful flash . enough to fill up a moderate size room . - great video mode with sound . it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv . - lcd is decent size and is fairly bright , which means it 's even visible outdoors in the daytime . things i did n't like about the camera : - manual could be more detailed . there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide . but there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail . - the auto focus illuminator ( for help in focussing in low light ) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes . but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions . - does not come with a battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately . i have owned the olympus c720 uz and the newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera is better than both of them .
1	if you are looking for a good small camera , and have no intentions of being ansel adams , this is a good camera choice . i travel alot , and this camera is perfect because it can fit in my pockets or a small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon . it was , in my opinion , not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was . i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i 'm not satisfied . in this case i did not have time to find another camera case . thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion . linda sutto
0	when i received the camera i thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it a 0 star . it 's true it looks good but it 's very hard to hold the camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also the lens is too small . the dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it 's small . thanks the dirty lens , the picture quality is worse than ever . the battery is very small too . after 6 months use , it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures ! they have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space . it 's not a user friendly camera .
1	i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best . i had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews , and i got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways . ( of course , it costs a lot more ) . recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100 % good photos , with several really outstanding ones . it is light , accurate and has is - what more do you want ? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it . bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment . if you have one lens , this is the one
0	i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the `` female '' end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black `` spring '' cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe `` portrait/landscape '' grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords
0	image quality is pathetic . it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso ( 80 ) . rest assured , you will be disappointed . i returned mine within a day
1	i had an olympus stylus 4mp and loved it but wanted a newer model . i purchased this 710 and love it . olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization . i love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use . there is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there is one thing i do n't like about the area for the usb plug in . you have to pop off this cap ( it hangs off the camera ) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera ( tight fit with the cap hanging there ) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and i wonder if that cap will eventually break off . in the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card . that is the only design feature i do n't care for on the 710 . it is a great camera and i am very happy with the purchase .
0	i no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until i could get back on my feet to get another good one . i thought this one may do , good price , looks sharp , purchased on impulse . . .big no-no . i will say the camera takes decent pictures ( as the previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with very good lighting ) . other than that , do n't bother . the mp3 is a cute function ( and quite possibly the most practical ) . the video , uhh , let 's not even go there . the voice recorder , also not bad - records in wav format and can be transferred to pc . jack of all trades , master of none . . .i guess that would be the best way to finally describe this item . i will say that i 'll be saving up now for much better camcorder and no more `` i just got ta have this right now '' save your $ , find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it . trust me , it will be overall better in the long run . .
0	i have an olympus fe 100 camera and the battery did not fit ! my niece has an olympus fe 140 camera and the battery did not fit in hers either ! the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck
1	seems panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo dslr market , with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with ois . excellent pictures out of the box , menu operations are plentiful , nr can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for aperture or shutter is very professional . leica lens is crisp and sharp , i shoot in aperture priority with nr at minimal and the pictures even in jpeg look like they have been post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens and soft pictures nikon was giving me is unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped rgb3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the panasonic . high speed usb is my only complaint for data transfers , noise reduction for higher iso noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking , a 3 '' , screen would be nice but maybe on the next model . btw , moon shots with the raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots with ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually have a telescope with ois at your reach , simply amazing . 100 % satisfied .
0	i bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste . the camera was much smaller than expected , trying to figure out what mode you 're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret . nothing is a simple `` one step '' procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children . i was so frustrated setting it up that i did n't bother giving it to her . the software installed okay but was also far from `` kid friendly '' . i wish i would 've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase . ironically , the reviews i did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids . i believe you 'd be better off purchasing a `` regular '' inexpensive digital camera for your potential `` shutterbugs '' .
1	at least for now it is : - ) . during the course of the past 10-12 months i have owned 7 , that 's seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models of casio 's : z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; and most recently presented my wife with a red s770 for valentine 's day . i also had a pretty good chance to evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and i to him for his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( a good friend of mine owns one ) , and panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , a gift from my wife and i to my father-in-law for his last birthday ) . if you read any of my digital camera reviews ( and i 've written a few by now ) , then you know that i 'm not particularly fond of canon 's lately - i think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer . as i also mentioned before , i 've tried several different kodak models ( and i used to work for the company too ! ) , but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time , to say the least . i became a big fan of casio 's , although not all of my experiences with them were great . but being a huge gadget `` freak '' that i am , and constantly wanting new `` toys '' , i have always craved for more . over time , my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control . so one by one , i returned/sold all of my cameras , and after extensive ( and i really do mean extensive ) research , i got myself an lx2 . i must say though that i probably would n't have without getting to know my father-in-law 's tz1 first . i was actually quite impressed with it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played with some other panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them , as well as spent a few hours on the phone , and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an fz30 , and who swears by it . unfortunately , lx2 was not available anywhere locally , but i felt that i got a pretty good understanding of what panasonic 's cameras are all about , and after some more thought and consideration , i went ahead and bought it from amazon ( nice thing about buying from amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days for a full refund , no questions asked ) . i did know about the `` noise '' issue at high iso 's , but it was n't a decisive factor for me , and i 'm glad i did n't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway . it turned out to be one of the best purchases i 've made in a long while . here is why : pros : - superb design . this camera is wonderfully crafted . and i absolutely love black ! it gives the camera a nice , clean , professional look . i do n't think i 'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one ; - intuitive controls , and menus . i charged the battery , put it into the camera , and started using it and taking pictures right away , without even going through the manual once ; - a load of features , including a large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens with a 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it 's done mechanically , which is a true way of doing stabilizing , comparing to other cameras where it 's done by `` tricking '' the camera into using higher iso 's ) ; and many more . in addition , it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus , has a number of manual controls , as well as provides ability to shoot in raw format ( more on that later ) ; - it comes with silkypix developer studio software for working with camera raw files . for someone who is not familiar with raw - it 's a `` pure '' , camera specific picture format . it varies upon a manufacturer , meaning that canon raw is different from nikon or panasonic raw , for example . and it 's `` pure '' in a sense that it 's of a much better quality than a standard jpeg ( jpg ) , and does n't suffer from loss of information , such as white balance , or brightness . there is a lot more to raw than that , and i 'm not going to go into details right now . what i want to say , however , is that having previously owned a camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must have tried about a dozen of different raw editing software packages , including products from adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , and more . silkypix delivered by far the best results of all . the only one that i would probably put next to it is bibble ; - noise - what noise ? ! i really hate it when i hear people complaining about noise in this camera ( after having it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera for that matter . are you really that na√Øve that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera ? think again . you might have noticed that i 've used the word `` compact '' several times here . i 've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise . some cameras are better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you will see some . this camera is no better or worse than any other one that i 've had/tried . at higher iso 's ( above 400 ) , it 's slightly more visible , but who in the right state of mind is using anything over iso 200 on a compact digital camera , such as this one , anyway ? i always have mine set to a 100 . if i feel that it does n't get the job done , i shoot in raw ; - picture quality is very good . yes , it does take some time getting used to , but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of , you can achieve spectacular results , especially if you do n't mind doing some post processing . as much as i like everything this camera has to offer , there are , however , some things that kind of irritate me . here is a short list of bad things about this camera , otherwise known as cons : - first of all , this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented . it 's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera , which is not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution is available only in 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios are available - 3:2 , and a more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , and 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera to others that do n't have a widescreen format , or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 mp digital camera ( because not all the pixels are actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic is aware of it , and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose , to boost consumer 's interest ; - i expected to see a compact digital camera . what i got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than i expected . i was really surprised to see how small , yet convenient to hold and operate , the camera body was . what i did n't like , however , was the lens . not the lens itself , it 's actually quite superb , but the fact that it sticks out . i like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body . i realize that it would probably loose some features , like the wide angle , and perhaps zoom , but i still wish it did that . it would be so much more ... umm ... compact ? ! the way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it . almost impossible , i should say . i 've tried a few , but they are either too small or too big . i just ca n't find one that would fit right . i put an order for an slx1b case for it , which is specifically designed to fit lx1 , and lx2 models , but i hear they are not that good . we shall see ; - i 'm not a big fan of a pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting to open it when i need to use it . and it also seems a bit flimsy . i 'm treating it as carefully as i can , but i just ca n't stop thinking that it might break soon ; - i hate the lens cap ! ! ! there , i said it . it 's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it , but for now i 'm not really happy with it . summary : despite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 is probably one of the best , most innovative cameras on the market today , and i sure am glad to have one . it offers more than any other camera in the same price range , and can even compete with some dslr 's when it comes to picture quality . if you are someone like me , who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography , or a dslr user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere , then this camera is not be overlooked ! highly recommended
0	probably would buy other camera if i could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash . it is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures . you have to learn how to be very steady with it
1	i purchased this lens back in march of 2005 to shoot static `` warhammer models '' with my 10d . i found that longer lenses such as the sigma 105mm , the canon ef 100mm , and the tamron sp autofocus 90mm all were `` too long '' with the 10d 's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot . the canon ef 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10d for this purpose . its small , its compact , and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i 'm shooting . as far as shooting at non-static objects , such as insects , the lens is slow to focus and loud , in both noise and vibration , which results in `` startled '' subjects and missed shots . the same also applies for non-macro shots as well . its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography , and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures , so i expected better . i ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective ; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket , making collimation impossible . in celestron 's defense , it likely happened in transit . amazon 's return policy is not a hassle , and i 'm upgrading her to another telescope . i 'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope . only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily
0	i recently bought a new celestron nexstar 4se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit . much to my disappointment , the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope , and when cold ( nights in colorado are 25-45f ) , the eyepieces did not fit at all . celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised . when i called a second time , they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem . amazon replaced the kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but the replacements did not fit either . i 'm returning that kit too . i finally bought a kit from meade ( 3 eyepieces and a moon filter ) that fit properly and are very easy to use . to be fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value ( hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1 ) . the meade kit is a worse value , but because they work in my nice new scope , they are the best for anyone using a nexstar 4se
1	the black of this is the same as on my camera , and with all the parts together , this is one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection , as i have not used it on a sunny day , but i do n't see why it should n't . and as cheap as this little product is , it is pretty much a must have with this camera ! ( s3 is ) one last side note , should you alreay own a extra lens or two . and they happen to be metal , be very carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour , so the metal would shrink , and i could get the pieces apart

1	this lens has extremely fast ( and quiet ) focus , and is razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close

0	this is a 1.2 volt battery charger . useless for anything that requires aaa 1.5 volt batteries
0	before that it was kind of nice , but it can not focus in even semi-low light . it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere , but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing . no way i would call the output hd quality , just the best sd ever with a 16 * 9 format . and then it broke
0	this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true ! i brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies . but i was sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures and videos . the only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that i had no need for . after about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better i gave up and sold it on ebay for the same price as i brought it for . it 's a great idea ... but it just is n't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice . the mp3 player is n't all that wonderful either . it does n't work with itunes . or easy work with windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would have read this before i brought this camera
0	i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years . i was extremely happy with my olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i 'm expecting . this camera was such a disappointment . just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $ [ ... ] than keep this camera
1	i bought this rangefinder for golf . it is small enough that i could keep it in my pocket . it really helps me with the approach shots to the greens . it takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag . i usually use a person on the green as my target . after i got an approximate read , i use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag . be careful with the tiny battery cover . it came loose and i lost it on the golf course . fortunately , i recovered it amongst the green grass . the cover is also green . i now put a tape over it to secure the cover .
1	i received the xacti a few weeks ago and it 's performing like i hoped it would . the controls are a very simple and intuitive . all the required hardware is included . does not require any additional software to run on mac or windows . i have a macbook with boot camp running windows xp pro . the camera works easily with either platform . it is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive . i am using a sandisk 2gb sd memory card . another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with minidv . the quality may not be the same as minidv but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference . the quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it 's just a camera by it 's small size . my old camera was a 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60 . this is rated at 6 mega pixel . you can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies . when filming movies , the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth , even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers . this is my first camcorder so i ca n't really compare to anything else ( except my old camera ) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
0	this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [ ... ] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
1	amazon is selling this at nearly 50 % off ! the eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them . the filters are really cool .
1	when it comes to buying camcorders , i personally like the one with the build in memory . but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind . unlike other sony camcorders , first of all , it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot . its a good use of your money . you can have it for under $ 400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there . easy to use , touch screen , takes still photos , has a good speaker so it 's easier to record video and voice , fits into your palm so to speak , and if you use rewritable mini dvds , you would n't have to worry about go out of memory . so when it comes to sony camcorders , i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly .
0	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera . the picture quality was not good at all . i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better . just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera , it stopped working and i did not use it that much . i now own the sony cybershot dsc-w50 that takes great pictures , i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006
0	canon 's 28-135mm with is ( image stabilizer ) is a far better choice for the money
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash . it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro . this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly . it snaps on and off easily . angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill . i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting . it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective . much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser
0	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests . the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips . are they abandoning this product ? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself
0	unfortunately i received the items damaged . the exterior postage box was unharmed but the paper boxes were obviously dropped at some point before packaging .
1	i bought the 250d lens to use with my sony dsc-f717 and it is just wonderful . i can also use it with my canon g3 because i bought a canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which is required and is inexpensive ) . i had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and i have seen many wonderful examples of its use . i recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their `` macro '' photography shine . get one ! just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and do n't be confused as to which one will fit your camera . edit : just a clarification : this one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' even though above ( on this page ) when you click the links `` see more technical details '' and `` see all product description '' it mentions `` 52mm '' . this is misleading and confusing . at the very very top of this page it says `` 58mm '' . let me just assure you that this particular one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' and 'is not ' the `` 52mm '' . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ) : well , it looks as if amazon finally corrected that misleading info i mentioned just above in my clarification
0	this unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw . i received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power . after that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on . it then failed completely and would not work at at all . i returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that . on both units the mp3 player continued to work . there is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch . but for this problem it would be a wonderful unit
1	i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind -- 1.4x is only `` 40 % better '' . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want -- i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage
1	this was my first digital camera , and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one . it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus
0	ok , this camera was inexpensive so i bought it for my kid for christmas ( 2005 ) . it actually took better pictures than my other camera ( other model sony cyber-shot ) , so i did n't give it to my kid , i kept it . i bought it a few weeks before christmas , it was opened and used on christmas day . i just used it days ago , and it just did the thing where it starts turning on , then immediately shuts off . it has been less than 1 year of use , but a week over 1 year from purchase . sony wants to charge me $ 111 and change , to fix it ( the camera was less than that when i bought it ) . i was just using the camera and it just shut off ! i searched inet to find many other people experience same issue . this camera is disposable ! ! ! ! i took my extra 256mb chip out of it to put in my other sony camera , and my wife said you ca n't see the screen ( lcd screen ) and you could n't for a long time . the other camera has the same issue many other people complain of as well . i also have 2 different model sony dvd writers for computer which are malfunctioning , and a sony vega 36 '' tv which is n't worth the money . i will never buy another sony product again !
1	this lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it , the fact is the fz7 and the fz30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15 % or so bigger than without it . if i can i 'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens . the camera i have is a fz7 . because i want as large an image as possible of my focus i am very happy
0	rated one star for the lack of value . you can buy the same canon brand case for under $ 14 and a higher capacity , imho better , albeit non name brand , 1200mah battery for under $ 10 from amazon . the neck strap is not worth the difference .
1	considering the price this camera works great , i use it for taking family pics and is wonderful . what i dont like is the lack of zoom great product anyway
0	the 5x7 digital photo frame from pacific digital is very cheaply made , the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly .
1	installing the software was a piece of cake , using it is quite another matter . the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles , tweaks and options . first attempts ? the moon came out real nice , but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail . nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site . will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well ( oh - was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry celestron !
1	we bought this bag for our panasonic pv-gs400 video camera , this bag is just the perfect size , we can fit our pv-gs400 , tapes , extra batteries , recharger , video cables , remote control , and even a small tripod . has different comparments . on top of functionality is done with a very high quality . i highly recommend it , just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy
1	i 'm still learning to use this camera and all the features . so far it is amazing . i 've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots . i use the auto mode a lot and it works great . the zoom is amazing . i love that it tells me when i am focused . also it has great battery life . i 'm very happy with this camera
0	i was extremely disappointed with this camera . it 's a shame there is no option for zero stars , because it does n't even deserve one . i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water , and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera . now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can . all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water . those pictures were so grainy that we could n't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of . extremely disappointing for a camera that was n't even submerged in water . not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none , so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they were n't even on the negatives . i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip , so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done . and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again . if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories , do not waste your money on this one . the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment . i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please do n't even bother with it
1	after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places , i 've been very , very pleased . the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky , ran on batteries , and had shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect , so i thought i would go for the dsct5 , since it avoids all of those problems . only a tiny battery to charge , no sticky shutter ... and it 's sexy as hell . the screen is huge and very bright . i hate taking pictures with flash in general , and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera . ( and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments . they come out surprisingly well and blur-free
0	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost . you truly get what you pay for , and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel . i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm ( 480mm on a digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want to make an enlargement from it . stay away . do n't believe the fools who are novices , you will be disappointed with this lens . you 're much better off to buy the older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( the l version costs more too ) but both are so much better than this junker . you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld . having switched from nikon when switching to digital , i almost judged canon from this one lens , which i 'm glad i did n't . do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did . this lens also had terrible purple fringing , almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm . after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses : canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version ) canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it . the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens .
0	over 90 % of pictures i took by this canon are blurry . no way can you fix it . i really got fed up with it . waist your money . waist your time . more important , waist your precious moments !
1	i have used the camera for three months , and absolutely love it ! the pictures are crisp ( even very close-ups ) , and the video feature is right up there . sound pick-up is excellent . i have created two dvd 's combining videos and still pictures . folks have thought the quality was very good . the battery life was rated very good , and i have found this to be true . i carry the camera with me nearly everywhere i go . people are impressed with the size . drawbacks ? because of its size , there are no connections from the camera to a computer , tv or battery charger . the docking station is small and lightweight . because of the battery life , i have never been away from home long enough to need recharging . i recommend the camera without reservations , and will look first to casio in the future
0	i love everything about this camera but ... .the display is very touchy . i only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke . i had it in a case and must have bumped it just right . my display shattered . mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of . this is not covered under your warranty . my camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet . so i am sitting here with no camera , which is really bothersome since i love taking pictures . i figured i would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen ! so i highly recommend this camera but you must be very very careful with it !
0	the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering . the `` plug and play '' ability is aggravating , at best , freezing two of my computers , requiring endless reboots to transfer images . photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual . the expensive battery is almost impossible to install . the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place . and the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out . buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead .
0	it fits in the s1 , but it does n't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the oem version . when it does n't charge i just re-insert the batter and it works , but its sort of a bummer
0	i am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible . i took about 400 shots with my digital rebel xt and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that i immediately returned it / got a refund . in all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus . in many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it 's entire range . since most of my photography is of animals i simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots . i tested the autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s ( packaged with the rebel xt ) and a canon 75-300 ef . in every instance where the tamron could not focus the canon lenses had no problem ! when the tamron would focus i found the pictures were not as sharp as my canon lenses . again i 'm far from an expert however i was only printing 4x6 photos . i replaced the tamron with a quantaray ( sigma ) 55-200 dc which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality ( for amatuers.. ) bottom line.. it was hard to part with the tamron because i was really enthused about the zoom range however i would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that does n't . i have read many reviews with the same problem noted . tamron needs to get thier act together
0	hi , i bought this camera and installed the driver from both the cd and then the web . it caused my computer ( a good , modern , fast computer ) to crash both times . the camera worked without interfacing with the computer , but , then , what 's the point ? also , the pictures and movies were very grainy and low quality . the tech support when i had these problems was horrible . they really did n't stand behind the product at all and to me that 's the most important thing ! maybe i could have gotten it to work , but not without some input from aiptek . i 've never written one of these reviews before , but this really got to me . do n't buy this camera is my advice .
0	date on still photo will not print , it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo
0	this is not the best way to get started in astronomy . the low power eyepiece is fairly useful , the higher power one less so , and do n't even think of using the barlow . the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x , assuming the objective lens is of good quality . when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope , you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown . to their credit , the manufacturer has provided a reflex `` red dot '' finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes . even so , what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited . some star clusters will be dimly visible , but galaxies and nebulae will be barely -- if at all -- visible . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on amazon ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 '' starhopper can be found on amazon for under $ 290 . for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : `` so you want to buy a telescope .
1	unlike many reviewers i am not diver . i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park , pool , and beach . this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash . this case has out lived an s400 and s500 . well worth the $ 170 price tag
1	i stumbled across this little gem by accident . i was picking up supplies at office depot and they had a kodak z650 ( display model ) on sale for under $ 100 . it was a ridiculous impulse buy -- i already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing i needed was another camera ! but what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be ! it 's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old olympus c-740 . i had never seriously looked at kodak cameras ... i always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are `` serious '' photographers . but i could n't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need i wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots i was used to with my c-740 . there are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots , but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots . i 've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it -- something i 've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras , including the c-740 . some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy , but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that i 've tried . at less than a third of the price of my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses the others by a mile . i stumbled on to a good find in the z650 ... it 's not going to give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot will . this camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots . i just wish someone would have given a good report on kodak cameras before i spent a small fortune on the others
1	well , i do n't even know where to start for this camera . but about a year ago , when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market , it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now . for the price , this camera has alot to offer . i just love the color tone of fujifilm . you get a very studio-like effect with fujifilm ccd technology . this camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers . the 9 megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping . the pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear . the camera picture can be noisy if you set the iso above 400 . so , for the best result , just set the iso level as low as possible ( lets say iso 80 ? ) . the 10.7x zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting . i used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me . i heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera , but just buy nimh battery that is about 2500 mah and above and you should get about 200-250 shots . make sure to buy at least a 2 gb memory card because the picture files are pretty big , especially in raw format . also , for the price , this camera feels very solid in the hand . it feels very professional and sturdy ( made in japan ) . the buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use . make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography . i recommnend the sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera . it works together really well . anyway , for $ 407 , you can not get a better camera than this one . thank you amazon for making this good deal possible . again , i highly recommend this camera .
1	the camera fits perfectly . the case is very stylish . best of all , its pink
1	easy , fast and serius tool , for cleaning your optics . the easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand . cleaning is fast with the nikon lens pen , cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done , as any profesional tool . now i have 2 of them , for my two camera bags .
0	i agree with the two previous reviewers . there needs to be a user manual and there is n't one . the fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . this is n't very helpful for star gazing . the maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . this is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together
1	5 stars ... easy to use . the screen is large and clear . the automatic settings include a variety of scene selections ( ie beach , party , fireworks scenes ) . i have yet to use the video , so i can not comment on that . i think this is a great all-around camera , and it fits in the smallest purses ... big plus . the screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling . my only complaint would be in the shipping . i paid extra to expedite my order since i was leaving the country a few days later . it was sent via ups with a signature `` in person '' required . when i missed ups the first time , i was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door . i had to contact ups to find out when they would return so i could sign in person , which was an ordeal . i wish i would 've known that the camera was being sent this way . i would 've requested that no signature be required .
1	i 'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if i said that care of lenses for slr cameras required a decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses ( canon and otherwise ) , so just be sure to confirm that that it 's the proper size for your lens
1	wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , has an ample selection of accessories available and protected by one of you lead in manufacture of camaras and lenses
0	the product advertisement is misleading or incomplete ( no picture of the actual contents ) . the following quote is from fuji mall : `` ac adapter : charge your batteries at home or around the world with the travel adapters . '' what it fails to mention is that the charger is an external charger only , and you can not power the camera or charge batteries while in the camera . i was looking for an ac adapter that i can power the camera ( and charge it 's batteries inside the camera ) . the nimh cells are not the 2500 ma/hr rating that comes with the e900 camera ( they are 2000 ma/hr , but this was noted in the product specifications ) . i teach a photography class and needed an ac adapter to power each camera used during the class while demonstrating . this product does not meet this criteria . it can however charge up to 4-aa batteries at a time , and includes an auto adapter which is handy . case is bulky , not small enough to tote an e900 conveniently when not bringing the charger equipment
0	i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it . for a point and shoot it is bad , it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot . it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings . while i enjoy some of them , most of the time my pictures turn out grainy ( in low light ) , whitewashed ( with flash ) or blurry ( of even slowly moving objects ) . i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things , but i rarely get a good picture when i need it . i never had these problems with my elph s200 . this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well , and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on . if given the option i would not buy this camera again
0	i bought this camera in about february 2005 but did n't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot . takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture . i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface ( loose dirt and sawdust ) and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on . contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to $ 100 and they will just send a reconditioned one . so i am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp
0	dont bother upgrading your power shot camera ... just buy a better one . the zoom lens ads a whole 5 ft to the view before the pixels become a big issue
0	not worth the money spent on it . after reviewing info on my new digital camera i followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on aa batteries . i did not need the camera case that came with this kit , and it really had too many pockets for my liking . the batteries did not hold a charge . i only got a few pictures taken before they went dead . if the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead . at least i got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones . i would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots . i have had no experience with rechargables before so i do not know if this is common . but i returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge
1	the best buy in the marketplace . it easily fits into my suitcase for travel ... the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is
1	for years now i have been buying `` bargain '' cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600 . this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
1	the balance with the grip on is really much better . yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking on wood as i type )
1	we bought this camera because our other digital camera ( sony dsc-h1 ) was too large to carry around a lot of the time . we took it skiing with us ( whistler , bc ) and it took some outstanding pictures , both of persons and of landscape/scenery . it is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . others may disagree , but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive . fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed ( or better yet , use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers , that does n't leave any marks on the screen ) . to summarize : this is an excellent camera , very small size but with a large 3 '' led display , takes excellent pictures , and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive . most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it . the only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder , but unless you have very bright sun at your back this is n't too much of a problem .
1	we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky , digital video that uses tapes , which we would have to copy onto vhs/dvd , stopped working . we did n't want to spend a lot of money . we loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it ( which is very simple to do , and you do not have to download any software . ) i have to admit i was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great , and only 60 minutes concerned me , but the pictures is great and i have n't ran out of time yet . we have used this indoors , outdoors and have no problems . we have recorded our son 's basketball games and it worked great . we read where the batteries did n't last very long , but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have . this is a must for those who have children or grandchildren
0	i 've had this camera for 2 years and i am glad that it broke so i can ( in good conscious ) buy a new camera . it is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying `` cheese '' . i always thought the battery life was sufficient , and that the quality of the images was fine , but i hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was . i 'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click . i actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it , but they said it was functioning normally . it was probably the most disappointing $ 200 purchase i 've made
0	after three weeks the batteries fails . i buy a knew one in walmart , and less expensive
0	i bought this camera two years ago , the pictures were always perfect , even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere , but then i found out that it was normal , not good but it usually happens to this cameras . but the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the error 18 ( e18 ) , the lens gets stock and the camera wo n't work at all . i searched in google about it , because the user guide says nothing about this error , and then i read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many canon cameras have the same defect ... i am really mad and dissapointed on canon , i will never buy a camera of this brand , and i would n't recommend it , unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or less and then throw your money to the trash
0	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day , so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy . unfortunately , the images appeared for one day , and then the unit stopped working . we had to send the unit back . i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item .
0	to customer before me , you camera d200 might be on recall . please check the nikon website for more info . you have described the exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 ? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200 .
0	the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera
1	i have received this camera for serveral weeks . it 's a good long zoom digital camera . i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez . the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized . the picture is sharp . image quality is good . however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 . when the iso is 400 or above , i can see the noise , and the picture lose detail . but every camera has its own defect . overall , i am satified with this camera , and i am enjoying using it to take pictures .
1	i got this for my mom when i got the digital frame for my husband it is very easy to download pictures on and she can show off all of her grandbabies this is an awsome gift for anyone the color and pictures are great
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good . unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities . for example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama and orchestra . this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities . earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 , which was way better than this camcorder . this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price . one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom . most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light . if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light , i do not recommend it .
0	i bought these binoculars because i wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding . first time out , i had difficulty getting a clear focus . to make maters worse , every bird that i looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it 's head . i have a pair of nikon 10x25s which out performed the bushnell 's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness . i am returning the bushnell 's and considering the audubon equinox hp binoculars instead .
0	not worth the $ 10 i paid especially when i had to spend $ 7 to ship it ! !
1	looked at a number of cameras including the tz3 , p5000 , and a few others . nothing compared to the g7 which is the one i ended up going with ; is , 6x lens , incredible quality , etc . if you want the best camera out there and do n't feel like messing with a dslr , the canon g7 is in a league of it 's own ~ the benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards .
1	fast delivery , great price . i would buy from them again , thanks =
1	i have another camera w/ 12x optical tons of features but i wanted something compact ready to take quick snaps . this fits the bill . on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots . the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either that or my hand is steadier . last but not least - the battery life was impeccable . i took a nearly 200 photos , plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge . the battery is a 'custom ' one which concerned me but the charger is very compact and travels well . it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables : )
1	i just got my new photo box today . i was so excited i opened it at work . then i took a picture of my wendy 's salad just to see how it looked . the quality of the pictures are excellent ( macro mode ) . light is evenly distributed . caution about the lights : the lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them on . i suggest for the shear sanctity of safety , shut off the lights between object/scene changes . the package arrived intact , the box was beat up a little , nothing major . when i opened the item , i noticed the camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom . this could 've been a bad/weak stitch , or may have happened during shipping , but nothing major was wrong , only that . besides , i can sew it ! overall , this is a great product , and is easy to setup and carry around . i 'd definitely buy again
1	pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy to use , big screen , good reproduction cons : microphone sensitive to wind , getting used to not having a viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera as an upgrade for my old canon zr10 . the first reason i chose it was the small size and portability . with a good light conditions , this little beast do its best shots , but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared with mi old zr10 ) . please do n't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution . the included handycam station have all the ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need to conect it . the big touch screen is a must , because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls ( besides some of them in the edge of the screen ) . you can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price , but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini dv format
1	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment
0	this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over-priced and disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003 . from the start , the colors never looked right , especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought the sb800s ( 3 of them ) , thinking the cls would be a great addition . but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments . the camera has a wonderful feel , viewfinder and reasonably good controls . but the results are disappointing . the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $ 1,200 . it just so happened mine was in melville , n.y. , with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value . i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers . indeed , forget nikon and go to canon
1	i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8/f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f/2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses
1	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 . it 's perfect , and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast , i received it within a few days
1	canon has three digital cameras for $ 2,500+ . the 1ds mark ii , the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i 've shot most of my photographic life ) because of canon 's more impressive suite of lenses . here 's the decision process i went through . as with most products , it comes down to how you 'll use it . all of them have tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged ( and cropped more tightly ) with less deterioration . the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp , the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp . if you 're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense . if you 're a wedding photographer , the 5d is probably the sweet spot . in practice , however , the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people . at 8.2mp , you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera 's native resolution . up to that size , you certainly wo n't see much difference in prints from the three cameras . that said , the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you 're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera . the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor ( fovcf ) . for the 1d , it 's 1.3x . what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor do n't capture everying the lens is `` seeing '' - it crops the view in a little tighter . the result : your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer . a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on . because the camera is effectively `` cropping '' the edges of the image that the lens produces , it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get , and it does n't affect the pixel resolution of the image . my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you 're switching from film to digital , some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf . your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this was most important to me , though it may not be for someone who does n't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years . both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles . the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000 , is not weather sealed and has more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what a solid , metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight . for those who prefer a camera with heft , these have it . for many people , this is a big drawback . the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz. , or almost three pounds for just the body , without the big battery . add the battery and you 're at 54 oz . the 5d is just 29 oz . and 31 oz . with battery . the 1ds and 1d , with built-in vertical grips , are also more than 2 inches taller . if you 're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around , the 5d is it . 5 . speed . there 's a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists , sports and many bird photographers . it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d . for most day-to-day uses , 3 fps is more than adequate . from using both , i 'd say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster , too . the 1d has 45 autofocus points , compared to nine for the 5d . 6 . price . give or take a hundred here or there , the 1ds is about $ 7,200 ; the 1d about $ 3,900 ; and the 5d about $ 3,000 . price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not . if you can afford it , go for it . otherwise , other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision . what did i decide ? first , i looked at how i 'd use the camera : photojournalism , travel and wildlife photography . the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed , so either the 1d or 1ds would do . in the end , i decided i 'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera . ( i bought the 300 f/2.8 is for close to the difference in price . ) so , i went with the 1d mark iin . if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife did n't need a new car , i 'd probably have gone with the 1ds . i 'm very happing with the decision and the camera . for most people and most uses - general portrait , landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go . ( or perhaps the next greatest camera that canon will announce later this year .
0	on reciept of the tripod , i found it wrapped and packed ( on the outside ) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product . when i opened the box , i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box . there was minimal packing around the tripod itself , mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching , and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around . i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping . also , if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company , instructions are not part of their package
1	this fugifilm padded soft case is strong , durable and very attractive . it was more than i expected . it is very professional looking
0	i bought this to play back old hi8 tapes so i could transfer them to dvd . however , there is no s-video out and no stereo out . video quality was bad : output was noisey and reds were over saturated . i imagine this is because there is no s-video out . i returned it and have ordered a sony gv-d200 . hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much . there are some cheaper used options available , e.g . sony evo-250
1	i enjoy the tc80n3.you may think it 's costly , but the features are out standing.i think it was worth the buy.the only disappointment i have is there is no `` on , off '' power switch
0	very good product very satisfied , the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette
1	i bought this camera more than half a year ago . my intention was to get a decent camera for images , but then also be able to use it for filming short movies . i 'm very pleased with its performance . in good lighting conditions , colors come out to be amazing . i really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling ! in darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly as bad as i expected from some other reviews . photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore , but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people . as about filming , it 's terrific . i mean , resolution is great ( sth like 848 by 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera . and the quality is super awesome , looks very neat on computer screen . respect . it has to be pointed out that you can not zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there can do that . oh , it 's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life . a great buy
1	easily snaps in place and does the job . considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well
0	well at least , some stuff is cool , free cam bag , the pics come out excellent . the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard . also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam . the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining . the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to `` freeze up '' . bottom line ... i recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams ... but this one ... isnt worth 159 or whatever . its trash . go for something else
0	ok , i imagine if you forked over the $ 900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal , but i am going to say it anyway . this little baby is way over priced , not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work . you need a wireless router ! ! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution ! with cf cards in the 12gb range it does n't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons ( i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg raw on the highest settings just laughed at me ) , however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot , take out the card , etc . what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it is possible . i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera . now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding , i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i do n't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $ 700 . get to it canon - i am waiting ! ! !
0	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 . my intent was to put him in the shade . that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 . tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards . my opinion is this product is not worth the postage . anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product . [ ...
1	very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $ 100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
1	combine the high iso , low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects . this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class . the f31fd does n't have is ( image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor ) , which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking . but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom , for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact p you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results . is also ca n't prevent blur from moving subjects . with a high iso like on f31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too . fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on 2007 's compact cameras , the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras . ah , and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal ... it 's really great , specially if someone who does n't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you , with f31fd they will not miss the shot
0	as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
0	this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures . and it takes wonderful video . the downloading is easy and in general it 's a `` fine '' camera . however ... . the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare . it 's constantly over exposing every subject . i find it practically un-usable . the only way i can get the image i 'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800 . if it had a 1600 iso i would n't need the flash at all practically but it does n't offer that . the other thing i do n't like that i did n't realize i would n't like is that it does n't have it 's own cradle in which to charge the batteries . the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately . does n't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it . the batteries lose their charge even when the camera is n't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice . intensely dissatisfying . this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture . this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces . i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic . i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon . i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d . but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo ( a publication i trust implicitly ) , i decided to stray from my canon . bad idea . i 'm going right to a powershot . do not pass go . do not collect $ 200 . i reccommend you do the same .
1	ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart . the problem with those , though , is that they run out of pictures pretty quick . the last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky . at that point i knew i needed an upgrade . i ordered the canon eos-1ds mark ii the next day , for [ ... ] the feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom . now when i take a family picture , i like to step back about a mile or two , then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose , to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips ( watch for her upcoming review of those soon ) . another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode . this is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession , about 5 per second . the other day i set the camera on the dresser , turned on the macarena , and got wild . i then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook . now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away . man i can dance . to summarize , you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did . definitely worth the [ ... ] ! but remember , there is a [ ... ] that comes with it ; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [ ... ] card , and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [ ... ] wont go through
0	the frame and the pictures it displays are fine . sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my pc . my major complaint is the power supply . the original power supply dies after 4 months . it was repalced under warranty ( after some grief with customer service ) . the raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired . i then had to buy one . that one died after a few months and the company did n't have the replacement in stock . after months of waiting from them to stock the item i gave up and after lots of searching on the web i found a supply made by another compay . i had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame . it 's been doing fine since then . i should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems . it looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now . i would do a lot of shopping before buying this one
1	this is the perfect gift for any occasion.i bought one for my husband for his birthday and he took it to work next thing you know everyone was on here buying theirselves one.it is a very easy thing to load pics on and hook up to your tv.he sales cars and hes got his on his desk showing his family off and cars that they also have on the lot for the older people who are unable to withstand the heat so they sit right at his desk and check every car out on his digital frame.i give this frame an a++++++
0	ok , maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much . the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera . both my 30d and rebel xt . if i am lucky enough it will fall off , get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory
1	this is the perfect case for my sony m2 camera ! yes i said sony m2 ! this camera case is perfect for it.very sturdy and not expensive at all.cool sony cybershot insignia on it and good `` d '' ring for your belt.fits perfectly for my m2 and it has a very cool and stylish look to it ! 100 % recommended to those who need a case for their m1 or m2 sony cybershot
0	this camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work . it 's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures . when you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible . we trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing
0	have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid . instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error . after getting best possible settings , main problem is still picture quality : using high quality jpg files as input , photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance . not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames . just arrived from amazon and intended as a v-day gift ( tomorrow ) for my wife , big disappointment , guess i better make a dash to the florist .
1	we got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it ! her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there is n't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film . we were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them . we were also aware of the battery problem , so she got rechargeable batteries . awesome little camcorder , especially for the price
0	nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card ( ms or sd ) . it will not operate without it ! on the back of the package it reads `` download photos with usb cable ( incl . ) or simply insert memory card ( ms or sd - not incl . ) '' wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they can not
0	if you can actually get the picture to turn out right , it does take pretty decent pictures . most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy . it also only holds about 5 pictures , so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot . i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars , and it does n't really seem worth it
0	do not buy this camera , i repeat do not buy this camera ! just read the reviews and you 'll know exactly what i mean . lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas , so i did n't spend a dime on it . i opened the package before reading any reviews . now i wish i 've read the reviews before opening the box . i do n't care what setting you use , i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera . the lighting sucks , you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones . i really wanted this camera to work , it looks sweet but sadly it ca n't take pictures .
1	overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems . # 1 ) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a sd card and into memory and vice versa . this would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer . # 2 ) hooking it up to a computer is a pain , instructions are not helpful . if you are using the viewer to look at images off of sd cards in remote places ( ie trailcamera ) it works fine , but i 'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so i can leave the card with the trailcamera . # 3 this is nasty , if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can `` crash '' the viewer . upon resetting it , it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card . powering off , swapping cards wont help it read . the pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract . reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader . for what i use it for i like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around .
1	first of all i would like to say that i was very reluctant to buy a sony camera . after doing a lot of research for my needs i ended up with canon 800is and sony 's new toy t100 . ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but i wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs . sony t100 is the best looking camera i have seen . it 's features are awesome compared to it 's small size . you can take it everywhere . big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight . it takes good indoor pictures too . i tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good . but then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me . the auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything . sometimes changing auto iso helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes ( which would be 99 % of the time atleast for me ) it wo n't make difference . just point and shoot . you get a perfect image for viewing on computers . no complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $ 80 . 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom . also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting . it does n't have touch screen like t50 and so it 's responsiveness is better . i would like it bit faster though . also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs . i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it .
1	this camera does all that canon says it does . fantastic pictures . great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use . i did a lot of research before buying , and i could not be happier with the canon g6
1	i love this flash . i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly . i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .
1	there some very detailed reviews , most of which i read before i ordered the camera from amazon . there is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful . i want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us . the camera came a month ago and i 've extremely happy with it . let me offer some perspective on my comments . the last camera i bought was a small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera that i was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures . i decided that since i was taking so many pictures i wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots , without my having to get a phd in picture-taking . i opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens . i now take the same pictures i took with the small camera , but with the zoom lens i can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels i can blow them up and frame them . there are dozens ( hundreds ? ) of features that i will grow into , but for now i am delighted to use this camera right out of the box , with just minimal reading of instructions . everything i remember from my 35mm days ( my first camera was a minolta srt-101 that i bought in 1973 ) can be put to use , but what i forget , the camera remembers . my point -- this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in
0	this was a terrible purchase on my part . it does n't even deserve 1 star . i just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky . the bag was too small for my z7590 , and i paid $ 8 shipping plus return shipping . i only hope they do n't charge me a re-stocking fee . i went to walmart , found a cute little bag in the electronics dept . that the camera fits great in , with room for the strap and extra memory cards or battery if necessary . they have cute ones for ladies too , with pink polka dots or stripes inside ! for only $ 12 . next time , i 'll be smarter !
0	bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error ( appears like the shutter never opens ) and will not record video . spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in . will update my rating after i see what is wrong , if they can fix it , if they will stand behind their product . watch for more details . before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price
1	this is my first and very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously . i was avoiding dslr 's because i used to rarely use my eos film slr . the convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming . unfortunately so are it 's limitations . so back i came , and the only choice though expensive was the eos 5d for it 's full frame sensor ! the pain was reduced by the double rebates . wow ! this is a revelation ! beautifull images , lot of control . i did notice that the af was not as fast as my old elan iie . i was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing . i am not happy with canon for this , but i really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned . this camera also needs prime or l lenses , because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses . this add 's to the cost . this is an exceptional photographic tool that i hope to use to improve my skill as i explore all it 's capabilities
