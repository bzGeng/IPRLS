0	the pick-up artist is a dangerously bad film . there is absolutely no chemistry between robert downey and molly ringwald . molly ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980 's female actresses , and she certainly proves her worth here . ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character was n't supposed to be . that marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element . the real joke in this film has to be robert downey . his acting is insanely moronic . i often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick . i am pretty sure robert downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to . from the start to the end , i was annoyed . i could n't see how dennis hopper and danny aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it . harvey keitel gives a fair performance , but i believe he is much tougher than that . comparing harvey keitel 's performance in bad lieutenant , reservoir dogs , and mean streets to the pick-up artist , it is enough to make an apparent observation that harvey keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this . a smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was rising sun , and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film . why did they have to call it the pick-up artist ? could they give the movie a better title such as the player
1	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie . micky rourke is excellent ( this is still in the days when he could act ) and so is the rest of this stellar cast . well worth it
1	first of all , let me say kudos to the seller for getting this to me as quickly as they did . it took about three business days from the time i placed the order . anyway , i love a good ghost story . ghosts are still to me , the quickest and easiest way to illicit fear . think back to when you were a kid and could stay up all night watching dracula or a stalker movie but had a chill running down your spine when you simply heard a good ghost story . but they have to have to have to be done right . in real estate the three rules are location location location , in ghost movies it 's atmospherte atmosphere atmosphere . the tricks of the trade are all old , but just like tripping on a banana peel , if done right , it works . the devils backbone not only gets it right , it bravely decides to take it deeper . calling this movie a ghost story period is a huge disservice . yes there are sections where there is a ghost present , but the ghost itself quickly fades into the background while we are pulled into a story that revolves around a time and an event that no american from my generation could completly grasp ... and that heightens the movie from a simple chilling tale into something far more relevant . the plot of the movie revolves around carlos , a young spansih boy dropped off unsuspectingly at a boys school during the spanish civil war after his father has been killed ( which for the length of the movie he never is told ) . he befriends one of the older caretakers , a few of the boys , and butts heads with a former student who now lives on the premesis . also he is informed by the students that someone else is on these grounds too , they call him `` the one who sighs '' . he appears to carlos a few times in shadow and in one particularly suspensful scene , in full body trying to tell him something , but for most of the movie , carlos simpy does what anyone else would do ... he runs . its only when he stops and listens does he learn to stand on his own two feet and to do what must be done to become not only a man before his time , but to save the lives of the other children he 's boarding with . it would be ignorant of me to suppose i can deduce everything the director ( guillermo del toro ) is trying to say , especially without knowing jack about spains history ( i had to look it up to find out what conflict was the central backdrop ) . what i took away from the movie is this-to become a man , you have to be willing to risk everything for whats right . its also a nicely told revenge story as the true main villain of the movie comes clear and states very clearly and elegantly what lot of movies clumsily stumble over themselves trying to . that alot of times fear of the unknown is nothing compared to what evil lurks in us and what we are capable of doing to one another . this is all very surface and obvious i know , and im sure symbolically it has alot more going on , but thats what repeat viewings are for . mr del tormo directs with a kids love for spook settings and a man who desparatly loves his countries sensitive eye . no other recent '' ghost story '' that i can think of has such an accomplished visual flare while blending 3-dimensional characters into a tapestry capturing a time and place so vividly . it also has to be said that the main cast , most of whom are children ranging from 10-15 do a very good job and he must have a gift for bringing a credible performance out of them , like spielberg or shyamalan . bottom line , the ghost sections of the movie really work , but what makes the movie is the human element . the ghost story becomes secondary and that 's not a complaint , anything else would have been a disservice to a heart renching story . mr del
1	this movie far exceeds its later edition . this edition is disturbing , but excellent . the violence , the gore , everything is heart-pounding
0	as segal continutes to move toward orson welles dimensions , his movies get progresivly worse . let 's hope this is his last
0	holy moley . this thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose . even *if* you could get past the editing , there 's the lighting . even *if* you could get past the lighting , there 's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video ( even in the first scene , when the flute player did n't even come close to keying with the notes ... and on and on and on ) . even *if* you got past the editing , lighting , and sync problems , you 're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage . no matter how good you think he is ( and i do agree he 's quite talented ) it 's obvious that flatley thinks he 's even better . at the expense of the story , the cohesion , and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment , he 's out to show how awesome he is . which tells me that other than dancing , he does n't have a lot going for him . he kind of reminds me of mighty mouse ... chest puffed out ... `` here i come to save the dayyyyyy ! ! ! '' i 'll tell you what to save ... save your money , put it as the very very last item on your internet dvd rental queue , and hope you never get to it
1	i first saw this film while taking four years of russian in high school . regardless of whatever else may be said about it , the film certainly gets its point across . russia is consistently portrayed as the victim . the aggressions of the swedes , the tatars , and now the germans are recounted . not surprisingly , no mention is made of the times that russia was the aggressor . the main feature of communism has always been its anti-religious , and especially its anti-christian , attitude . the teutonic knights are portrayed as being surrounded by crucifix-wielding monks . the reader gets no sense of the fact that the then-current pope had repudiated the teutonic knights and condemned them for using missionary activity as a cover for naked german aggression . alexander nevsky is depicted as a communist-by-anticipation . a scene shows him scoffing at `` the people with money '' . it is implied that these people were unwilling to support the defense of russia against her mortal enemies . the barbarity of the germans is shown unambiguously . they are shown throwing live russian children into the fire . the heavy armor of the teutonic knights , a primary cause of the ice of lake peipus breaking under them , seems to anticipate the heavy mechanization of the wehrmacht in operation barbarossa seven centuries later . music is a prominent part of this film . jubilant music celebrates the determination to win and the final victory . morose music highlights the cruelties of war . the whole gamut of human emotions is shown . there is a scene in which wounded russian soldiers cry out to their girlfriends or wives ( `` anastasia ! '' `` natalia ! '' ) . there is also irony in this film . as a russian soldier is stabbed in the neck by a german who the russian had attempted to tie up , the mortally wounded russian 's last words are , `` i knew that the armor was too short ! ''
0	i was very disappointed with this film . it definitely had a more `` art house '' feel to it than i was expecting - and like happens with many art house films sebastiane is light on plot and character development and heavy on scenery shots , bad string music and slow motion nude shots ( but , alas , not even erotic ones ) . the real story of sebastiane is a fascinating one . how does such a man transform into the much beloved st. sebastiane of the catholic church ? well , do n't expect this movie to tell you . there is , as mentioned above , no character development . we are given an off-handed explanation that sebastiane 's faith ( christianity ) was the cause of his eventual execution - but any scenes of faith are oddly intertwined with a lot of roman flavored philosophical ideas - references to roman gods and so forth . very un-catholic . so while we know that it was sebastiane 's faith that lead to his execution , this `` plot line '' is really dulled down , to the point that there is no plot . the other men on the island are nothing more than pretty bodies to look at , their characters do not get developed at all . ( the interaction/conflict between sebastiane and the roman guard could have been so much more interesting and potent if jarman had fleshed out that character a little more ) also , disappointing was that the eroticism of this film falls miserably flat . now i realize that i am a female and this is a gay movie , but i would like to think that i am as aroused by sexy , nude men as much as any gay man would be . well , i was not aroused . there are plenty of shots of nude men , but the way that jarman shot the film is so stylized and stiff , that it takes all the eroticism out of it . i watched a slow motion scene of two nude men splashing in the surf and all i could think was `` gay men are actually turned on by this ? ? ! '' well this straight woman was bored about half-way through the movie . so my advice is do n't buy this movie for it 's story line or it 's erotic value - there is none of either .
1	after her amazing performance in misery , bates takes the role of another stephen king character : dolores claiborne . dolores is a tough , bitter , sarcastic woman who is accused of murdering her despotic employer , vera donovan . we are all hasty to set a judgement upon her , but as her story unfolds we realize that things are far more complex than what they seemed at the beginning of the movie.jennifer jason leigh proves why she is one of the best young actresses around by playing celina , dolores 's troubled daughter who hates her mother for the wrong reasons . i own this dvd since 2000 and it is still one of my favorites
1	this movie has great casting . the actors play characters that they usually do n't play . this may be the best acting i have ever seen keeanu reeves do
0	i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot . it was terrible . first because of the camera shake , i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking . needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film , but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
0	in the early going , i thought the choice was between four and five stars . as the movie progressed , my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four , so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second . the ending was so disappointing that i had to drop my rating to two stars . it is about a polish man in france who marries a french girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her . he returns to poland without her , manages to get rich , and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved dominique . the problem with this writing is that he loves her , so why is he plotting revenge against her ? it is senseless . the ending is utterly surreal . she should hate him for what he has done to her , but she is smiling to him . he is looking at her and crying . he has betrayed her in a cruel way . he does n't have the right to be crying for her . that is like hitler crying for the jews . he is still in a position to help her out , but he wo n't . it 's really pretty sickening . the story becomes unclear enough as it is , without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss . it left me angrily saying `` what the hell is going on ? '' i really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience . i do n't find that cute at all . tell the damn story and tell it clearly . besides , the ending sucks
0	watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled . boring and tacky even by horror standards , the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids ' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet , hence the title . i 've seen far worse , but those worse movies were more `` enjoyable '' than this . the following morning you probably wo n't remember having seen it . if only the monster had eaten this movie 's negative , then we would all be spared
0	this movie was obviously made for young children , and older people will noyt understand it
1	this movie is a highly enjoyable , somewhat erotic 70 's era film that reflects greek nightlife and lifestyles of adventurous , yet responsible young adults traveling abroad for a summer vacation . as darryl hannah 's naked preview to `` splash '' , she can be found splashing around in clear blue ionian waters with her boyfriend ( played by handsome peter gallagher ) and his new french , female lover who lives and works in greece and becomes part of their existing relationship . ( yes , clearly liberal european values here , as all three of them also splash around in olive oil , champagne and the villa waterbed ! ) beautiful scenery of the greek isles , local sights , and ruins , as well as examples of westernized post-hippie 70 's culture of nightclubs and greek social life . romantic , dramatic , light-hearted and fun for most responsible young adults and older adults who just want to watch a culturally entertaining movie . there 's even a surprise visit by the mother who comes to check up on her daughter during her own vacation to the greek isles , as she witnesses the residual existence of these strange , yet humorous behaviors . cultural nuances and nudity ; intense look at deep , yet adventurous relationships and positive ways to deal with deep feelings that rule many human sexual behaviors . humor , adventure , beautiful scenery , romance , light drama , cultural intrigue ... this movie has it all
1	great movie . hard to believe what c. bale did to his body to make this film so realistic . great photographic work
1	ok , so it is n't one of the movie greats but it is really enjoyable.four idiotos rob a bank when one of them is supposed to be marrying drew 's character , whatsername
1	movie way ahead of its time . the violence is cuttiing edge for its time , a peckinpaw trait , but is tame by today 's standard . first rate movie i think and very underated . i like warren oates and the support acting roles are well done . i think well worth the money. -- 5 star
0	i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd . i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies . however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed . it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes . the episodes : davy crockett , indian fighter ; davy crockett goes to congress ; and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier . the episodes davy crockett 's keelboat race ; davy crockett and the river pirates ; were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates . i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc . the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector 's box . the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $ 37- $ 100 whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for $ 14- $ 16 . i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately .
0	the ones that are posted twice do not work . if they are posted once , you can try to download it , but it might not work . the video only worked for about a minute . shame , since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool . the one cent csi works , go download tha
1	let 's start with the negatives . this vid is too damn short . a half-an hour does n't do justice to the title groovy gals . where are the marvellettes ? where is brenda holloway ? second , because the acts are taken from different shows , groovy gals has no flow and a chopped quality that is only made worse by shoddy editing . third , host jimmy o'neill is really irritating and useless on these tapes . why not edit him out and give us more acts ? on the positive side , this tape has more rock royalty than you could shake a gold record at ! the queen of soul , aretha franklin , just nails the shoop shoop song with her gospel-spiced vocals , and mention must be made of the blossoms , led by the legendary and highly-underated darlene love . they back up franklin and a number of acts and look like they 're really having fun with i like it like that . speaking of rock royalty , my personal faves , the supremes , glide through baby love with the style and sophistication that made them princesses of pop . ross has big hair and , with flo and mary , does the slick , subtle choreography that tattooed them as motown acts . a rare treat is ketty lester torching out love letters . wow ! watch her make the word `` sign '' an eight-syllable word in song , and enounciate each word . but the wildest was the last : the acid queen , tina turner , electrifies with ooh-poo-pah-do . tina in a tasteful cocktail dress and nice pumps is jarring enough , but when she lets out the clutch and revs the song up ( backed by the blossoms who are clearly enjoying themselves ) you will be hard pressed to tear your eyes away . other acts include the toys looking bored and jaded as they sit in a fake garden setting in lover 's concerto ; leslie gore romping through judy 's turn to cry with shindig 's lame go-go dancers ; fontella bass with her one hit , rescue me ; great rare shangri-la 's footage of give him a great big kiss ( such naughty shimmies ! ) ; jackie deshannon 's tender version of burt bacharach 's what the world needs now and petula clark showing too much brit restraint with her monster hit downtown . yes , the filming is b+w and strange at times , but if you love the time period or the music this one is a necessary document for collectors and fans . enjoy
1	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci-fi such as star trek ( the newer ones ) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was . v : the final battle is the second installment of the saga , so make sure to buy v : the miniseries first . the storyline is good , and characters are likeable and three-dimensional . i highly recommend it for any sci-fi fan . for old hands it is a fun movie , and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction
1	well , this is one of the long-waited dvds from pink floyd . the video and sound are great . the extras are not so special but for the pf fan this is a must . still waiting for the `` delicate sound of thunder '' dvd
0	a slow , loggy movie about a philandering husband ( everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based ; he was ephron 's husband ) . jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife , and both are uncharacteristically bland . there is hardly anything to the story : they marry , she gets pregnant , he gets restless and wanders . we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started . very dull

1	here comes mr. jordan is a delightful 1941 fantasy film that would later be remade with warren beatty ( although not nearly as good ) as heaven can wait . robert montgomery , father of elizabeth montgomery of bewitched fame , plays boxer joe pendleton , who is on the verge of fighting for the title . joe is plucked out of his airplane just before it crashes by an inexperienced angel played by edward everett horton who wanted to save him the pain of the crash . the angel 's boss mr. jordan ( claude rains ) finds out that joe is n't supposed to die for another 50 years and orders the over-eager angel 7013 to put joe back in his body . unfortunately , joe 's body has been cremated by his boxing manager . now mr. jordan , 7013 , and joe scour the world to find a new body for his spirit . but it has to be a body that is in perfect physical shape ... '' in the pink '' as joe keeps demanding . joe is offered the wealthy body of bruce farnsworth who has just been murdered by his scheming wife and his male secretary . joe at first refuses until he sees the beautiful bette logan who desperately needs farnsworth 's help to get her father out of jail . joe agrees to take farnsworth 's body for just a short time to help ms. logan . his wife and secretary tony abbott are more than a little shocked to see farnsworth come down the stairs after they thought they drowned him in his bath . joe soon decides he wants to keep farnsworth 's body as he has fallen in love with bette and thinks he can get farnsworth 's body into shape to resume his boxing career . but first he has to convince his skeptical manager , max played by wonderful character actor james gleason . here comes mr. jordan is a great feel-good , comedy fantasy with a fantastic cast . montgomery is superb as the street-wise boxer , now in control of a vast fortune but still only concerned with his boxing career . the bickering between he and edward everett horton is hilarious . claude rains really steals the show as the wise angel mr. jordan , always with a knowing , sly smile on his face . vastly superior to its remakes , this is a great film . reviewed by tim janson
1	wonderful movie from the 2nd world war period . poetic very british . movies like this are no longer made
0	i 'm sorry ... i really , really tried to get into this movie and just could n't . it was just plain boring . normally i love these types of movies but not this one . i just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point ' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile . never happened . i would recommend renting this one first just to make sure
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	i watched this movie last evening and i have to say that i have never seen weird , confusing movie since 12 monkies . i 'm still confused . the plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing , it 's all about lucid dreams and tom cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him . the film is basically all a blur from start to finish , it 's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance . why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway . do n't buy this film on dvd or you 'll be wasting your money . i 'm sorry if you 've found this review uninformative , but since vanilla sky is really about nothing whatsoever it 's very hard to go into much detail .
1	i love this movie ! ! i remember the first time i saw it , i was about 6-7 yrs.old , on a plane on my way to puerto rico . eighteen ( or so ) years later , i bought it watched it with my family , it brought back so many great memories , we loved it all over again . i love the music , the dancing the actors/actresses , the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is an 80 's movie ! we all know how 80 's dance movies have the bad fame of neing corny ! i have to admit , it did have some corny and bad acting moments , but all in all , i think this is an amewome movie , i love it recommend it
1	hollywood make them , then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise . sometimes they rise again , and sometimes they disappear . and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in `` the big picture , '' a quirky , cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of . it has a few awkward stretches , but overall it 's a darkly witty cult comedy ( `` you 're tracking failure all over my carpet ! '' ) . nick chapman ( kevin bacon ) is the winner at an arty student movie competition , and instantly agents are chasing him all over l.a . in no time , he 's the rising young director , with a movie deal at a major movie corporation . but he 's also starting to lose sight of his old life , as he tries to become a major success . he changes the style , plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics , turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie . he dumps his pretty girlfriend ( emily longstreth ) for a bimbo actress ( teri hatcher ) . when the studio head gets dropped , nick falls as quickly as he rose . but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video . this time , can he get it right ? christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries , tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals . his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz . but his talents are just as present in a `` typical '' movie , and guest does a smart , quirky job of it . the lesson : be true to yourself and your art , do n't fall for empty glitz , and do n't let success go to your head if you 're lucky enough to get it . the story is a pretty straightforward one -- nick gets great success , it goes to his head , he falls , and he rises again a wiser man . and the movie falls into straightforward lines , without many unpredictable plot twists . at first glance , it does n't seem that unusual . what makes it special ? well , simply put , guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit , like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick 's life . not to mention the glorious dialogue . when speaking of nick 's one'n'only music video , a studio woman announces , `` it 's the best one yet , and i 've seen 'em all ! '' and guest manages to show us agents , artists , students , directors and actors , but never descended to cliches . they 're real people , no matter how nasty . and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is . his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet , where he confesses , `` i wan na be your friend again . '' and he 's backed by good performances by longstreth , michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh . `` big picture '' treads where many movies have gone before , but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video . a must-see
1	i 'm 7 months pregnant and have been looking for videos that i can do in short blocks of time , and this one is perfect . i 've been a fan of tamilee 's for quite a while and have several of her tapes , all of which are great . she 's very motivating and encouraging , and i like the fact that she really has a good background ( education-wise ) when it comes to fitness . this one is no exception . just a warning - if you are looking for complete body toning or cadrio , you wo n't find it here : this one just hits the main areas ( legs , biceps , triceps , shoulders , butt and abs ) . but that does n't mean it 's easy ! i found myself sweating just doing a few of the exercises ( even before i became pregnant ) and i 'm in fairly good shape . i 'd recommend doing this video and interspersing it with other longer , total body sculpting videos
1	what do an environmentalist , a firefighter and a chain-store executive have in common ? quite a bit according to this joy of a film . david o. russell and jeff baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who 's trying to make sense of his life . that man is albert markovski ( jason schwartzman ) , a founder of a group called the open space coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area 's where big business want to tear it down . in his latest attempt he 's joined forces with a chain-store known as huckabees whose exec on the way up brad stand ( jude law ) seems to have a hidden agenda . all this aside , albert is troubled by a very tall african teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life , so he seeks out the help of vivian bernard jaffe ( tomlin and hoffman ) , two existential detectives , hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense . vivian and bernard are also helping tommy ( mark whalberg ) , a firefighter with strong views on humanity 's role in destroying the environment . when brad finds out about albert 's association with these detectives he sees this as a way to get at albert , to diminish his credibility with open spaces and thus gain control of the land and marsh huckabees wishes to tear down . so he himself enlists the help of vivian and bernard in order to jab at albert 's sanity , and this affects his girlfriend dawn ( naomi watts in another brilliant performance ) who begins to take these detectives advise seriously and this jeopardizes her relationship with brad and with huckabees since she is `the voice ' and `the look ' of the store . when tommy and albert meet they decide to ditch vivian and bernard 's methods in pursuit of caterine vauben ( isabelle huppert ) , a french existential detective who is in competition with the jaffes . their methods , while similar , are actually at two separate extremes and throughout the film albert finds the balance he needs to make sense of it all . this film is pure joy , hilarious from start to finish thanks in part to the brilliant acting on the entire cast , tomlin and law are standouts to me for their comedic timing is impeccable , and whalberg is a complete surprise , holding his own and proving he can act . i have n't seen a film this smart in quite some time , and another probably wo n't come along for too long either so lap this up like a puppy and enjoy every last gulp
0	the setting of this film is in the late 70s , just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes . burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be `` artistic '' in his craft . heather graham plays his psycho-starlet , and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is ... .well ... ..let 's just say , endowed . wahlberg 's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of . wahlberg 's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes , although i do n't know if the film-makers would admit as much . at any rate , he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his `` package . '' this hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters . this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie . well , it could have been , but all the way through there seems to be something missing . there are times the film `` seems '' to try and convey a message , but i 'm not really sure . one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i 've never cared for wahlberg . he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt . also , i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered . given the context of the film , one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women . that 's simply not the case . in the end , however , the biggest problem of this movie is n't wahlberg or the lack of nudity . the difficulty is that it 's just plain boring . i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn , and yet this flick failed to grab me
0	this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books . ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson 's performances not to mention jeff tweedy 's music . as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music . it is written interestingly enough , but the visuals look like there was n't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on . the best way to watch this movie is in the background . you do n't need the visuals , and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away
1	i caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and i could not remember the name but i did know who stared in it ... so when i went online to get the name of this i was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price ... thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly ! ! ! thanks again ! !

0	someone just today told me i should see this film . what a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality dvds being produced by fox lorber . oh well
0	this movie was even more ignorant ( in a bad way ) compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well . the name of the movie ( dumberer ) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is . the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy + it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh . do n't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it 's worth every penny for comedy fans
1	100 men and a girl is the story of a group of musicians who are out of work . they seem to be led by one man ( adolph menjou ) whose energetic daughter patsy ( deanna durbin ) will stop at nothing to see her father and their friends find work . she decides to bother famed conductor leopold stokowski for help , but he only becomes annoyed . instead , she finds a rich woman who promises nonchalantly to sponsor an orchestra if it existed . patsy proceeds to gain hope and organizes the orchestra only to find that the woman has left for europe . patsy decides that her only choice is to berate the woman 's husband and stokowski for support , ensuing great comedy . deanna durbin is still a little girl in this film , bright and cheerful . she has a great sense of comic timing and displays her usual charm . the songs she sings `` it 's raining sunbeams , '' `` a heart that 's free , '' `` hallelujah in f major , '' and `` traviata '' are operatic but well sung . mischa auer plays michael , one of the musicians , and a very funny one at that . he adds plenty of laughs to the film . there are a few spots where a black box rims the film during montage sequences . this is a bit distracting , but otherwise , the camerawork is excellent . one notable scene is where the unemployed orchestra congregates on a staircase to play the `` second hungarian rhapsody , '' photographed artistically and beautifully
1	this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso . while it touches on his climb to fame , recognition and success in the art world , it focuses primarily on his personal relationships . i love his work , but i sure would n't have wanted to live with him ! the video had therapuetic effects for me ; i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships , how they are and how they should and should n't be . a winner all the way around
0	`` red water , '' a made for television film starring lou diamond phillips and kristy swanson , carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off `` jaws . '' you would think that nearly thirty years after steven spielberg 's project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre . you would be wrong . every year brings us even more `` animal gone wild '' flicks , everything from sharks , octopi , whales , snakes , bears , rats , ants , birds , cats , dogs , dinosaurs , crocodiles , alligators , and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans . if the creature in question has sharp teeth , claws , wings , talons , tentacles , and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget , straight to video knockoff of `` jaws . '' sure , there are elaborations to the standard plot lines , none of which significantly improves these rip-offs , but all of them owe a big debt to steven spielberg 's film . for example , `` red water '' tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a louisiana river . it also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed . none of these ideas disguises what is really going on . `` red water '' is the story of john sanders ( lou diamond phillips ) , a down on his luck fisherman with an ex-wife , horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician , and loans on his boat he ca n't afford to repay . at the same time sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments , a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers , fishermen , and anyone else who manages to get in the way . sanders could care less about the shark , primarily because he does n't know about it at first and also because his ex-wife kelli ( kristy swanson ) just walked back into his life . she 's a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river , and she knows that john is an expert on this sort of thing . whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name `` kelli '' is another matter . sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles . after all , he 'll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat . what none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks , one that swims and several that walk around on two legs . the movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities . this guy hires some mercenary thug , along with a goon named ice ( coolio ) , to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash . and would n't you know it ? the site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where sanders and kelli eventually show up ! what follows is incredibly predictable : the criminals take over sanders 's vessel because they think these guys angling for the money , a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers , and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals . how predictable is `` red water '' ? not only is there a cajun chap helping out on sanders 's boat , we get a few scenes of a cajun party complete with music and dancing . just in case you are n't aware that you should laugh at these hicks , the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to `` deliverance . '' how clever and original is that ? i 'm starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows . if you put any minority group in the place of these cajuns and did the same thing , the outcry would be deafening . it 's not the overt prejudice of the cajun scenes that sinks `` red water '' ; it 's everything else . the venerable lou diamond phillips has n't made a good film since ... well ... i ca n't recall , actually . i quit following his career after `` the first power . '' as for kristy swanson , i was surprised to see her here . i remember her star rising in the early to mid 1990s , but at some point she fell off the radar and , if `` red water '' is any indication , into b-movie purgatory . it 's sad , really , because she 's not that bad of an actress . coolio , on the other hand , goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money . if i had known from the start that this guy was in the film , i would n't have watched it . aside from the performances , or the lack thereof , the production values are low , the pace drags , and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters ' mouths . i really , really wish i had written down some of the odd lines uttered by phillips 's character . i remember watching the movie and thinking at the time , `` i should write that down and use it later in a review . '' for some reason , i did n't . probably because i just wanted this thing to end quickly . in another bizarre turn , the movie carries a 'r ' rating even though there is n't much bloody carnage going on . the only extras on the disc , fortunately , are trailers for `` bats , '' `` the big hit , '' and `` ride or die . '' if you 're really interested in watching creatures attack flicks , there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from , most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level . `` red water '' is too bland , too confused plot wise , and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining . if you decide to head up this river , good luck to you .
1	this is another american remake of the original danish movie , starring stellan skarsgard , which is more interesting than this remake . i always wonder why , when hollywood does a remake , they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place . even though i give this remake 4 stars , mainly because al pacino and robin williams restrained themselves , and that hollywood changed the ending . check out the original . i give the danish original 5 stars .
0	i honestly ca n't believe that robert patrick wasted his time on this piece of [ junk ] movie . ugh ! one of the worst movies i 've seen in quite a while
1	this is a chase movie , a kind of film-noir without the black and white . here the ordinary man is jeff goldblum , a guy so so unhappy with his mundane job and cheating wife that he spends his nights driving the la streets instead of sleeping . one night he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time . he interrupts the murder of a beautiful and mysterious michelle pfeifer and very shortly he finds himself her unwilling accomplice as both evade her ruthless pursuers . she warns him right up front that she is `` one of the bad guys '' , but he 's hooked . the chase takes them to all of the `` mink-lined sewers '' of after dark la and lets them encounter quirky and sometimes violent characters . this movie plays like a mix of dark comedy and thriller.it has a plot twist of sorts , but does not end darkly . the cameos will be interesting to film buffs , but not to anyone else . it 's goldblum , pfeifer , and the chase that drives this movie . and thankfully , the story - though improbable - strings tightly together and does not involve stupid car chases , explosions , or wanton killing . in fact , the violence is tame by today 's standards . there 's the brief nudity seen in 80 's movies and occasional mild profanity . a nice film to rent . i bought it
1	most people i know who have viewed this film fall into two categories . on one side there are those who hate it , while on the other are those who like it . i am of the latter group . this is not a comedy , although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh , it appears to be a comedy . however , make no mistake about it , this brilliant film is more than that . it is a biting satire of a very dark side of life . one i would n't wish on anyone . i did n't know what to make of this film when i first viewed it . and i knew it was darker than a dark-comedy . surely the director was making another statement in this film ? and maybe he was . the dysfunctional life of vanessa ( reese witherspoon ) and the even more dysfunctional life of the sociopathic bob wolverton ( keifer sutherland ) converge in one hell of a nightmare . this satire on the life of vanessa as a modern day `` little red riding hood '' meeting bob the `` big bad wolf '' while on her way to grandma 's house was like a punch in the face when i first saw this film . i did n't think of it as a comedy -- as many do , but actually a sad commentary on one part of american society . this film hits you in the gut . even though some parts of the film are funny : the disturbing parts are much more powerful . highly recommended
0	will not play once video was downloaded . i get the error message : `` can not play file , please try again later . error # 0x80040273 '' i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed , i was told the unbox saturday and sunday 6-5 hours . i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature . i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem . thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again - feb. 10,200
1	based on bram stoker 's dracula and murnau 's movie , the film is extremely beautiful and the sequence of the woman crossing the square where they celebrate a final feast is impressive
1	i have the vhs tape of jane eyre , starring joan fontaine and orson welles . felt both characters were well-cast , with the quiet and sensitive fontaine as jane eyre , and the brooding , inscrutable orson welles as her employer , mr. edward rochester . the black-and-white movie is more suitable for this genre , in my opinion , than the color version , as it depicts more accurately the brooding and eerie qualities of thornfield hall , the rochester residence where his mad wife ( of whom jane knows nothing ) is shut up in one of the towers in an unused part of the house with her `` keeper '' grace poole . i felt the acting as well as the cinematic quality of this movie accurately reflect the atmosphere that charlotte bronte was trying to portray in her novel .
1	i love this story for my boys . it is now a story i put on for my grandson . it keeps their attention and there is always something going on . i do wish that the few cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted . you should explain that this has nothing to do with your religous beliefs . it is really entertaining . i love the bird and i love the song bright eyes . i would recommed this for anyone 8 and up . i do n't think girls care for it as much as boys .
1	when i was little , i remembered this show before i read the original cat in the hat . i was enanmored by the animation of the great late chuck jones and the wonderful vocals of allan sherman as the cat in the hat . if you see the credits , theodore geisel had his hand in the music . i recently bought the sing-a-long tape for my daughter , grace , who is 3 years old . she requests to see it , so hopefully the new dvd will be a great asset if it has extra features such as interviews or even behind the scenes of one of the best animation short classics ever
0	this movie , the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it , is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime . the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious . elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures . anita shreve 's writings never disappoint , read the book instead .
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
0	this is another hollywood costume epic . they spared no expense with the set and costumes , hired talented big name actors rex harrison , liz taylor and richard burton . despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive . harrison was terrific as gaius julius caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and richard burton does not come across as a great mark antony . his character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by cleopatra , antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked ? although the film is titled cleopatra , it focuses more on the historic events . the film also reduces cleopatra to the woman depicted in octavian 's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent , a gifted political strategist , expert linguist , dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty . they do n't give you sense of what was so compelling about cleopatra . she is depicted as a combative shrew with both caesar and antony . i doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man . if you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here ? i would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as roman military leaders and the weak position of egypt compared to rome . given the limitations of their vision of cleopatra liz taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish , beautiful , seductive and glamorous temptress ; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance . although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you ca n't deny taylor 's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material . although taylor shines sadly we never get to know cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed hollywood costume drama . this movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance ; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50 's and sixties - the style reminds me of demille films like the ten commandments . it did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of taylor and burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit . the research , writing and the directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama . the real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great .
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	i struggle with this movie . i 'm a die-hard fan of jean-claude van damme , so part of me really likes this movie . but the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script , uninteresting characters , and horrendously bad acting ( save for jcvd himself ) . having said this , i can honestly reccomend it to fans of van damme . they will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his indian buddy and pickin ' up chicks . if this appeals to you , there should n't be any reason why you would n't like `` desert heat . '' if even one of this does n't sound good , stay far away
0	this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable . good enough to watch once
1	this was my favorite episode as a kid . i was so happy to see i could download it to watch with my kids
1	this is one of cinema 's great achievements , a testament of the combination of elements ( subject , visual style , photographic image , movement , sound , background music , character , montage ) are perfectly blended into a unique experience . the new yorker print , however , is the worst copy of this film ( 16mm , 35mm , television screenings ) i have ever seen . this was a copy with a lack of contrast , extra noise on the track , looking like a dub . if only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice . as it is , enjoy what you 're stuck with but know there 's something better out there . burt shapir
0	i have not seen this movie , but thanks to the review of `` a viewer '' from july 2001 , i do n't have to
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	this movie may not be for everyone , but to me it 's highly memorable . possible spoiler alert : this is n't your ordinary `` travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about '' -flick ( back to the future -- although , granted , it was better made and more entertaining ) . butterfly effect is really about ( in alphabetical order ) acceptance , chance , charity , choice , grownup love , hope , identity , opportunity , regret , and sacrifice . some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting . here are my thoughts : kutcher to me always seemed an innocent , caring , small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as , and that 's why i was n't surprised to see him pull off this role . amy smart was good mostly , but glaringly off-key at times ( granted she had to show more range the the other actors )
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode . not only did i get charged , but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge - i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund . once it finished downloading , it did n't play anyway . i gave up .
0	okay , i was excited to see this movie . i read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought i knew a thing or two , but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more , i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from . i mean , who cares about these people 's relationships ? ? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail . this movie sucked
1	what a great movie . and it 's still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors . the panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying . the print that was used has stood up very well . this is the movie that got me interested in programming computers when i first saw it . before there even was a microsoft , i had dreams of one day building my very own super computer under a mountain somewhere . the damn things can now fall deep inside your ear canal and lodge inside your brain if you 're not careful . i wish the movie had more story to it instead of just being a rather quick build-up to an even quicker ending . but this is a movie i can watch over again and again . wow . this is n't just any movie about a mainframe and its keypunch operator . this one 's the real mccoy
0	the complaints about this dvd release are all correct . great movie , low qaulity release . yet i 'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most , the self censorship . the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer . we 're ok to witness a pirate being drunk , but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate ? what are the execs at disney thinking ? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such `` questionable '' material as they did with many of the vault collection ... fine , but stop chopping up the movies . our ten year old children are not buying these movies , many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we 're being ripped off . stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance . keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title
1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri-la and its elusive transcendental nature
0	i 'm a big fan of colin firth and i was disappointed of this movie , i felt sleep , wish i never do on an average good movie , i do not recommended if you 've seen bridget jones diaries , not even close..
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
0	this is one of the worst movies ever ! it seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body
0	having avoided seeing this film , i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on , brought `` tuesday ... '' unbiden into our home.my aversion to oprah and her ilk , does not cloud my dislike of this film . a bad film is a bad film.devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned , and directionless directing , this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned , to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward . something should occur , my interest should be engaged . this film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses , and attempts to build the plot from words alone . it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said , `` hey , this book is full of words , lets make a movie . `` in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.to be honest , jack lemmon was not very good in this film . he played the same character he always did . just older . hank azaria was just awful . he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones , and was wooden and expressionless . maybe he was too embarrased to be there . as to the other actor 's ; well they filled up the space nicely.the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality . the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was . they even covered the green leaves on the trees . some better acting , some good r rated dialogue , and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film . as it stands , however , it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr.phil , etc . the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs , but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases , a good cry , and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.i , for one , think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial . then pull the finger out , and just get on with it . ( to the grammar and form police : i did have this in paragraphs , but the editing process scrunched it all together . sorry
1	i really like the pokemon movies and i was not dissapointed with this one . i have watched it about 7 times over the past several years . team rocket never plays as big of arole as in the t.v show though
1	my 3 1/2 year old little girl saw the `` charlie brown christmas '' on tv this year and loved it so much that i had to order it . she watched it over and over and enjoyed it as much as i did over 40 years ago when i was a kid . just goes to show that some things never get old . and , what a treat to be able to share it with her now .
1	john cusack is a favorite in our house . this movie has many funny scenes and quotable lines . it is the old boy loses girl and tries to get girl back story , but with a new approach . the supporting characters are very funny . great for a rainy day
1	putting it simply , this film is the work of a genius . as a tom stoppard fanatic , i adored it from the moment i read the play , which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with . he was significantly more satisfied with the movie , and there is very little doubt as to why . he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working . any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film -- they may or may not like it , but that 's not what matters . this film is amazing
1	lets start off with how happy i am this finally after all these years got on dvd . i remember watching this movie when i was a kid on hbo . i was not more then 8-9 but i remembered it so vividly that when i decided one day to search on amazon for it , i went insane when i saw that it was there ! this movie revolves around the 80 's , you guy can probably tell by the cover picture . its mainly about a not popular girl named louise miller who is striving to make it throught school and at the same time crushing over the most popular guy . she went into a fortune telling store and the little lady , who i have no idea who her name is though , lol she is that lady in poterguist as well . either way , the fortune teller lady to her that on the night of her 16th birthday , she will have her powers . louise sorts of thinks the lady was crazy , runs away . true to the fortune tellers words , she finds out the hard way . she starts to believe in her powers and ability and used it for her own benifits . sooner or later , to make herself to become the schools most popular girl and snag the man of her dreams . but then in that process , she might lose her really close friend that has been with her through thick and thin since the beginning of probably grade school , who knows . lol . but then later on she realized that her powers she has may be too much for her to handle . will she give it up and go back to who she was , a nobody ? or would she learn to use them wisely with the old lady 's help and fix the mess that she got herself into ? the only tibit of it was when i bought this from amazon . i bought it for the price of $ 9.99 and then a few days later , the price changed to $ 6.99 . what a way to take the money !
1	i have a friend who looked for a year for this movie on dvd in brick and mortar stores , i ordered it for her and she had it in a week , and by the next week , she 'd watched it ten times . its a very good movie
1	this movie hurt , hurt in its absorption , and hurt in its aftermath . much like `` betrayal '' , also starring jeremy irons , but far , far more devastating . jeremy irons and juliette binoche were good . `` damage '' all around .
0	i 'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot . it 's redundant and unnecessary , and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent . only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself . double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that 's based on and well ... my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it 's original format onto dvd was bad . the soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film , therefore the voices do n't sync up with the lip movement .
1	i guess that is the point of this movie , but there is a little more to it . kowalski played by barry newman is a car runner that always delivers his cars . on his drive there he gets chased by a bunch of cops but he drives a dodge challenger , so nobody will catch him . his back story is explained in a few scenes of how he used to be a cop and a race car driver . everything in the movie is very interesting but the car chases are the thing that is going to hold your attention . well , also the naked woman riding the motorcycle , you have to like her too . the dvd gives us the uncut uk version and wow what a difference . also a commentary by the director was a real treat to listen to .
0	i brought this movie a couple of days ago and i was very very very disappointed . do n't waste your money on this movie
0	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film
1	fellows : i picked up the dvd in london , at a cost of 20 pounds , or about us $ 39 . there were still four copies left at the virgin superstore in picadilly circus . so you got be able to find it somewhere , even not on amazon .
1	i first encountered this film on bravo . . . and after a few minutes , i knew i had to buy the dvd ( simply because it was clear the our great country had grossly edited the film for a 1:00am showing ) . cemetery man is one of those genre defying films that surprises at every turn . it is amusing , thought-provoking , and borrows inspiration from the surrealists ( in fact , consider the scene where francesco and his love are passionately engaged under the sheet in the mausoleum . . . this is actually inspired by magritte 's `` the lovers ii . '' ) moreover , strains of kubrick can be noted as francesco ventures on a killing spree to `` an die freude . '' soavi aligns himself with the greats and proves , that in many respects , he belongs there . not a mainstream fan , this was my first experience with everett . his acting was absolutely impeccable . franceso 's ennui reflects our own ennui . likewise , françois hadji-lazaro showcases his enormous range with his portrayal of gnaghi ( a seemingly simple-minded `` idiot-child '' who harbors a reserve brilliance ) . the dynamic between these two actors is rare . their exchanges are both humorous and tender . the plot has been rehashed here over a hundred times , so there is no need for me to elaborate . simply allow me to say , if you are looking for a zombie film similar to romero 's work , do not bother . you will be frustrated . in many ways , the zombies are incidental to this film . . . they shamble around the edges , but have no real role . the actual story is one of desire ( and the inherent dangers of desire ) . so , if you have ifc blocked , think bravo is too `` artsy , '' or find sundance pretentious , by all means , do not try this film . furthermore , if the thought of voluntary male-castration has you running for the hills , visit a more pleasant page . but if you are intellectually curious , buy this film today . five stars for superb acting , gorgeous cinematography , and unparalleled writing .
0	i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it , and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart , funny , and heartbreaking , without ever being sappy . so , naturally , i was curious about the movie too . i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too , not much could go wrong . and while the story line followed the book more or less , the movie turned out terrible . i could not have been more disappointed ! ! first of all , jack nicholson is completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( as usual ) , not the *interesting* guy that mark is supposed to be . he is the opposite of charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e . somebody that the character of the wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely . you suspect all along that he is a cad ; therefore , rachel 's utter shock at his betrayal does n't make sense . besides , he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy , but much better in her role as rachel . still , she ca n't carry the movie alone , and her love scenes with nicholson are flat ; there is no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel , and whether she really did write all the scenes . the wedding scene , where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing , while the wedding guests wait , is out of place , not to mention boring , not to mention heavy handed . a total dud
1	scooby doo rocks ! this was an awesome episode , and an awesome way to download some of the earlier episodes of scooby . fun stuff , and an inexpensive download
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	i have to wonder what world , what physical plane , what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on ? or maybe they are full moon employees lol ... first of all , the movie , especially one of the earlier scenes , was identical to the 80 's flick `` the unnamable '' , which is also and hp lovecraft based flick . the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit . when he breaks out his cell , well this was just hilarious , it reminded me of the incredible hulk . yes , jeffrey combs is in it . but his acting is cheesy as it can be . hunt down the unnamable instead , a much better movie
1	while this movie was filmed in the coos bay , oregon area i got to be an extra in it . i had my doubts about it at the time . but now that i have seen it , i say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good movie . some profanity and mild nudity . not for the real youngins . btw , i am the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar , the girl i was flirting with is my sister
1	this is a very enjoyable film in which everything , from the acting , to the music , to the costumes , is just right . it depicts an earlier , friendlier los angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back.to an aviation nut such as myself , it is heaven , perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation . the music fits the action so well . in fact , there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from rocketeer as his performance music . most excellent ! the joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film . i wish there were more movies like it
0	this has been rewritten to dumb it down . the beautiful language originally used by him has been replaced with dumber versions , and entire paragraphs have been removed . as someone who read and loved the original story as a child , i was very disappointed to see this when i began reading it to my 7 year old son
0	the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow , tepid , and hard to grasp film . the previews for this film were better than the actual movie , i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great ( i 'll try and remember that next time ) . the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward , you 'll know what i mean when it happens , the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere , very intrguing spurprise awaits . anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it , happy viewing
1	love sam elliott ; even when the material is n't tops , he is ! this one is really good
1	these were two of the most amazing and creative films i have seen in months . buster keaton wrote , directed , acted , and did all his own stunts in these two films . he even did stunts for a lot of the other actors in these films too . `` our hospitality '' is the story of a feud between two families that reaches a crisis point when keaton falls in love with a daughter in the other family . in `` sherlock jr. '' keaton plays an aspiring detective and movie projectionist who dreams that he is a famous and skilled detective . not only are these two films engaging , well made , and interesting , they are funny ! ! i go weeks sometimes without laughing at a sitcom or a movie that is supposed to be a comedy . i found myself laughing out loud numerous times during this film . there are some classic scenes that just stand out when you watch these movies . the whole `` floating down the river '' scene at the end of `` our hospitality '' is jaw-dropping . these have got to be some of the most dangerous stunts ever attempted . in `` sherlock jr. '' there is a pool game where every ball on the table is bounced around except for one which is miraculously untouched , there is the harrowing motorcycle ride , there is the escape from the gangsters , i could go on an on . these films are like live action bugs bunny cartoon . there were several occasions where as i was watching these movies , trying to anticipate what was going to happen next i said to myself , `` no way . he 's not really going to do that . that 's not even possible . no sane man would attempt a stunt like that . '' and yet ... he does . there are about 4 or 5 scenes from both of these films which are completely seared into my brain . that is n't an easy thing to do . most films do n't have one memorable scene , and to have a single film with 5 or 6 of these scenes is nothing short of amazing . they just do n't make filmmakers like buster keaton anymore . i wish i knew where his creativity came from . if directors today could channel even a fraction of the skill that keaton exhibited , cinema would be an amazing and wonderful place
0	i bought this movie because of charlotte alexandra . i had seen her in a really good movie with charlotte rampling called `` the pool . '' she was beautiful to watch and played well against one of my favorite actresses , charlotte rampling . `` a real young girl '' on dvd was of low quality and did n't make sense to me . i can not recommend it . some scenes were just gross . it was not even a little sexy . it was sophomoric . i did follow amazon 's suggestion and also bought two other movies ; `` romance '' `` frivolous lola . '' `` romance '' was good but a little dis-jointed and needlessly explicit in some parts and not explicit enough in other parts . the other characters were flat and empty . `` frivolous lola '' was hilarious , explicit , sexy , and fun even if it was a little dated . i will see this movie again with friends just to laugh
1	+++++ this movie is based on the story `` the adventure of the dying detective '' ( 1913 ) written by sir arthur conan doyle ( 1859 to 1930 ) . adelaide savage ( susan harker ) consults sherlock holmes ( jeremy brett ) about what she can do about her husband 's cousin , culverton smith ( john hyde ) who seems to be having a negative effect on her husband victor savage ( richard bonneville ) . sherlock dismisses this as not in his field of expertise until adelaide 's husband dies from a parasitic fever . coincidentally , her husband 's cousin is an expert in such diseases . even more coincidental , the majority of victor 's estate will go to his cousin leaving his wife with very little . at this point sherlock becomes interested . he even publicly states to smith that these coincidences are not within the realm of probability thus implying that smith is a murderer . but how is he to prove this ? unfortunately , sherlock comes down with the same disease that victor died from . and the only person that can help him is smith ( as dr. watson ( edward hardwicke ) attests ) ! brett ( as usual ) does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance . also john hyde as culverton smith gives a fine performance . i had a friend who knew nothing about brett 's health problems watch this movie . she could not see anything abnormal about him and , in fact , commented on his excellent performance . i also felt his performance was excellent . finally , the props , costumes , background music , and cinematography are well done . in conclusion , this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it 's based on ! ! ( 1994 ; 50 min ; british drama ; made for tv ; full screen ; colour ) +++++
1	madonna gives a stunning performance ... explicit similated sex and graphic language ... we really enjoyed the concert ... this is defininatly one of her best ... now if we can get the blond ambition tour from japan and the usa , i would be very happy ... 5 star rated . i own this disc
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
1	run time was 48 minutes . a stellar documentary . the download worked perfectly . hope the review was helpful . ty
0	the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent . i wo n't bore you with the list . all the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake . tell us something new . the overall storyline does not have much else going for it - i was expecting more intrigue , a more synthesized story line . a disappointment .
1	for all you hal hartley fans who have desired having a copy of simple men on dvd , your time has come . simple men will be released on dvd widescreen format january 27 , 2004 . i ca n't wait to get my copy ! !
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy . this is my fourth video , and i 've only had problems with one , and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it . got ta agree with a. huck on the dsl , though . while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great
1	monkey business is one of the cutest movies i have ever seen and it 's just so funny to see cary grant and ginger rogers take the youth serum and act like children and they were great and also the monkey were absolutely adorable ! this movie is recommended highly
0	then you should n't call yourself a singer . the `` concert '' is lypsinch , lypsinch and lypsinch again , there is not any song on it which is live
0	just repeat the following several times . 1 ) draggy plot 2 ) uninspired acting , especially allen , who almost sinks it 3 ) unimaginative ( story , direction , etc ) then get a hitchcock film
1	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things ; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink , decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis . please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama . go for this emblematic film , where paul newman makes a delirious performance .
1	great old time classic . do n't bother watching the remake with harrison ford . this is all you need to see
0	i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king 's short story version in his classic book , night shift . i was excited because king 's story was such good scary fun . well , i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was . while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror , the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze . king 's story was short ( like 10-20 pages ) and sweet , w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields . the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter . the running time is 90 minutes , including about an hour 's worth of padding . cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king 's anthology movies like creepshow . as it stands , it 's bloated and pretty boring . of course , linda hamilton is in it , which is why i gave it an extra star ...
1	great movie - there is n't anything i can say that has n't been said 100 times .
0	possibly one of the worst movies ever made , bo and john derek managed to massacre the tarzan legend while wreaking cinematic havoc with this unbelievably bad waste of celluloid . where to begin ... .the lousy script , the poopy cinematography , the atrocious acting ... .i ca n't think of enough adjectives to describe how putrid this actually is . as for erotic - forget it . jane should have boffed the ape instead . jane and papa head through the jungle , delayed by her repeated falls into the river . despite the time period , when women were supposed to be modest , jane does n't seem to know what underwear is . yeesh . i ca n't believe people actually paid to see this tripe . if you must watch it , rent it and save some $ . you 'll be glad you di
1	singer had the best male body , bar none , i have ever seen in films and *it* is really the star of this one , right behind the two ferrets , `` beastmaster 's '' friends . most of the camera angles enhance singer 's musculature . he has learned how to stand and move to best advantage for the cameras . he 's not handsome , though , which does n't really matter in this film . the film is fun , action-packed and pretty to watch . while tanya roberts in her rather small role is nice to look at , she can not act her way out of a paper bag , but manages to lend another perfect body to the cast . rip torn , the evil one , barely suppresses a guffaw at the lines he has to say , but pulls it off nonetheless . the plot is good - `` beastmaster '' ( singer ) is ripped from his mother 's womb before birth , placed by occult means into the womb of an ox ( cow ? ) and is then ripped out again at knifepoint . as a result , somehow he is able to communicate nonverbally with animals and they are his helpers - an eagle , a black leopard and two ferrets - on his way to avenge his mother 's death . for what it is ( bad acting , beautiful people and an unusual plot ) , it deserves the cult following it 's got . after all , cult movies do n't always become so by being great works of art . buy it just for fun , suspend your incredulity for an evening and just enjoy it
0	lame ! lame ! lame ! corny sexual humour . no wonder it tanked- if the amazon.com thing is true . because it 's bad . do n't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world
0	the sound is bad . i have tried this dvd on 2 different players and it made no difference
1	i enjoy watching this movie over and over again with my family and friends . best purchase i ever made
0	i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie . this movie is contrived . the character that reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie . personally , i do n't find his behavior to be romantic . he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him . this is not romantic to most women nowadays . he is not suave in the role he is playing . it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it
0	what does wild things 2 have going against it from the get-go : a ) no denise richards b ) no name actors c ) being a crappy direct-to-video sequel d ) no denise richards naked . . . what is wrong with wild things 2 after the fact : a ) a script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew b ) one sex scene -- a ( weak ) threesome , one of the few things even linking this to the original c ) sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked ( leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot ) . . . wait let me play that again ! if i seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an erotic thriller . did i mention no denise richards ?
1	this is definitely not the typical look at the `` death camps '' . this is a truely `` horrific '' look into the reality that was the death camps . i wish it was longer , but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours . with the option of just listening to the soundtrack , that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
1	i ca n't believe how underrated this movie is ! i never saw it because i had never really heard much about it , but when i finally saw it , i absolutely loved it , along with my whole family ! i 'm 20 year old girl , so obviously this is my kind of movie , but my brother loved it too because the script is so clever ! this movie is hilarious , touching , incredibly romantic , and so beautiful ! ! the cinematography is astounding , the sets and the costumes are wonderful , and tom and nicole are perfect together . they have such great chemistry on screen ! i have watched this movie again and again and it is one of my all-time favorites . i highly recommend this film ! this is an epic film that should not have been overlooked ! ! !
0	this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u.s. to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba . and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie . there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language . but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on . this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all . whatever the message of this movie is , whatever it 's trying to convey , it 's lost in the plotless story
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	this is not a shoot-em-up western . if that is what you are after , stop reading right here . what this is , is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy . the genuine article cowboy . in particular , it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy , near the end of the 19th century . almost the whole of the first half of the movie , there is no plot to speak of , just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had . nothing is rushed , and yet it is never dull , thanks to an intelligent script . there are humorous moments and great lines , but plenty of pathos and melancholy too , as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways . we see the cowboy-turned-outlaw , the cowboy-turned-storekeeper , the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper ... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend . as the plot kicks in , there is nothing contrived about it , but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them . the movie benefits from some great performances from some classic character actors such as william devane and barry corbin , as well as a brilliant star turn from tom selleck who has never been better . it also benefits from the stunning scenery - ironically not in wyoming as the movie suggests , but shot in canada . the sweeping vistas , free of any trace of civilization , set against a backdrop of the rockies , are stunning and superbly photographed . what pulls this above it 's tv-movie-of-the-week origins is the sincerity poured into it by all concerned , and not least by the prolific director simon wincer ( lonesome dove , quigley down under ... and crocodile dundee in los angeles ! ) and executive producer tom selleck . this fills the movie with those little , almost subliminal moments which make it feel real . the result is no classic big screen film , but a perfectly judged and understated homage to a bygone era . it leaves us with the notion , that though the golden age is over , there will always be real cowboys .
1	i am so thrilled with this video . it has helped me tremendously not only with increased flexibility but with a more positive attitude . dr. maloof 's voice i find so soothing and calming . the stretches cover all areas of the body . i just feel so relaxed and rejuvinated after i am done . i have definitely have made a commitment to myself to do this regularly . it makes me feel terrific ! !
0	maybe i 'm spoiled by big-budget sci-fi films , but i thought this movie kind of stunk . it felt and looked like a tv movie and was n't scary , at all . the best/funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady 's name or face , and everyone described her the same way -- '' the one with the glasses . '' `` oh , her -- have n't seen her . '' lol
0	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it
0	it 's not just that if lucy fell is a bad film . 90 % of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired , formulaic dross just like it , and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it . what makes this movie memorably , remarkably bad is writer/director/star eric schaeffer 's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard , which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday 's roadkill . the mere fact that the photogenically-challenged mr. schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he 's `` cute '' speaks volumes
1	big fan of 80 's ... music and culture , and most of all the movies . she 's having a baby is not just a teen movie like `` sweet sixteen '' or `` breakfast club '' . its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day . soundtrac is great with kate bush `` the woman 's work '' . my girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played . i told her i 'll feel the same if she were the wife . boy i got lovin that nite ... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80 's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby , i thought it was clever .
1	i got the movie i wanted . i saw it one summer many years ago and was never able to find it . it was never played on tv that i saw . it is a very touching movie and it is a true story . i love watching true stories . my daughter orders from you a lot and this is the first time that i have did it and i got what i wanted . thanks so much ... ...
0	the young actor is great in this movie , but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring . **

1	i saw a high school production of brigadoon in san francisco at the ica ( immaculate conception academy ) at 24th and guerrero . these girls who played the parts had never been anywhere near scotland , you could tell , and some had not been in the usa very long and the charming accents of south of the border stood in for the strong scots burr . nevertheless they played the show beautifully and ever since then i have had a fondness for the music and the story . i feel that the makers of moulin rouge were probably trying to capture some of the big-hearted appeal of brigadoon when they created their fantasy world . watching the movie i have always felt that a bit of the magic was lost because so much of minnelli 's canvas was spent on dance elements which , imho , are just not that interesting . so many dance numbers created to take advantage of gene kelly 's and cyd charisse 's astonishing abilities . maybe too many ! thus some of the musical numbers had to be cut out , including some of the loveliest of the songs lerner and loewe wrote for the 1947 musical . imagine my surprise and delight when the new dvd came out this spring and i discover that , in fact , minnelli did film three of the rejected songs ( and recorded another , perhaps the greatest ) and that all of this deleted material would be available on the disc . i was in hog heaven . however we are all familiar with some deleted scenes that you watch and then you say , `` well , i know why that sucker got deleted '' and i was afraid that these scenes would be of inferior quality . ( like `` is it a crime ? '' in bells are ringing -- forgive me , `` crime '' fans ! ) but it is my pleasure to report that all 3 numbers here are keepers . i wish somehow they had been re-integrated back into the main print of brigadoon and we could then judge the movie for once and for all the way minnelli wanted it . if it is too long , then maybe shorten down the `` sword dance . '' i feel sure that somewhere footage must exist for the exquisite `` there but for you go i '' -- or is that just a dream of mine ? in any case we can now hear the track , and we can see the fully staged versions of `` come to me , bend to me '' and the marvelous `` from this day on '' which is to brigadoon what `` from this moment on '' is to kiss me kate . all in all , the plus factor makes this disc the one to buy if you 're wanting the full brigadoon magic
1	ted is a lonely bellhop . he 's got the whole hotel all to himself on new year 's eve . so , what else can he do but be the lap dog for every requesting customer . but , he only has to worry about four particular , and sometimes peculiar , rooms . each room is a story involving ted , directed by four different directors . call it a collaboration of different comedic talents . so , let 's go through them , one by one . story one : the secret ingriediant not really much to go on here . a coven of witches are trying to ressurect some virgin wicth who was wrongly accused of a crime . not really that funny . it 's a bumpy start but it gets better . ted stays the same goofy self all through the movie . story two : the wrong man . a mistaken identity sex game in which ted accidently found himself in . constantly he tries to escape the room . funnier than the last one . still bumpy , though . story three : the misbehavers ( directed by robert rodriguez ) funny story of a couple leaving their kids in the room to go celabrating the new years eve at a party . these kids are bad news . they get their hands into any and everything . poor ted runs rampant to make sure they wo n't misbehave or else the father will kill him . ted at his best here . hilarity incarnate . explosively funny . story four : the bet ( directed by quentin tarantino . ) an after hours new years eve party with a witty group of filmakers who have had too much to drink . quentin stars . bruce willis too . ted stays the same , quirky and naive as well . funny and different , but quick on the jokes . there is one take where there is just one uncut shot , lasting well over ten minutes . they must 've rehearsed that one for hours . the overall feel of the movie is unique and full of laughs . enjoy
0	i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks . this film was wack the acting , directing . but the story line was cool . in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting.this film flip flopped time periods hurt it 's cause.i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole
1	a killer stalks a small community , and a high school student ( neve campbell ) who is facing the first anniversary of her mother 's murder appears to be marked for death . this is a very well-written , clever slasher film that takes great delight in poking fun at the genre of slasher films . it 's full of trivia and self-aware clichés as well as some genuine thrills and a well-planned surprise at the end . the whole cast is very good , but matthew lillard as an obnoxious high school boy and david arquette as a deputy sheriff stand out . director wes craven , who is responsible for some of the slasher films ( most notably the first `` nightmare on elm street '' ) that inspired kevin williamson 's inventive screenplay , does the best work of his career here
1	this movie is almost 40 years old ... can you believe it ? to those of you who have n't seen this classic , my only question to you is , why ? why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible , so wonderful , so fun , so beautiful . it is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we do n't have filmakers and storytellers like we used to . we have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action , that we have forgotten how to tell a story . we have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved . if this movie was created in today 's market - and it pains me to say this - it would be a box office flop . but fortunately , it was made when it was made . fortunately it had three of the most talented actors of our time in it ; the always incredible paul newman , the likeable robert redford , and the stunningly gorgeous katherine ross . the combination of these three characters is absolutely magical . if they made this movie today it would probably have in it ; brad pitt , ben affleck , and jennifer lopez . yuk ! i better shutup before somebody gets a bright idea of remaking this classic movie . i can not even imagine somebody having the gall to even try and redo this jewel of a movie . everything in this movie is top notch . every scene is just gorgeous and full . i was just a kid when i first saw it and i did n't fully understand all the layers that this movie contains . now in my early 40s , i truly appreciate roy hill 's vision . everything seems so natural . there is nothing forced in this movie . there is nothing contrived . there is nothing but pure movie magic . if you 've been waiting for an invitation to finally see this movie , consider this your invitation . but , i warn you ... do not buy it if your attention span is less than four seconds . so if you 've read this entire review without changing the television channel or talking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your `` homies '' then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema
1	some of the best lighting i have ever seen on face of that hunk c. tommy . john peters is a genius
1	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track . it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone . durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine
1	this film is really excellent , with a great cast , and a thoughtful and frightening message . we see the story of a group of high school boys graduating and then immediately joining the german army to fight in world war i . the story revolves around paul baumer , a thoughtful and sensitive young man who gradually sees so many horrors of war , and loses so many of his friends , that he is transformed into a different person , a war-weary pessimist with no illusions , no dreams , no purpose , and no homeland . richard thomas does a masterful job of playing paul baumer . he is supported with a fantanstic cast of actors . ernest borgnine plays the peasant shoe maker who leads their platoon . he is an earthy fatherly survival focused man who does his best to ensure his men have food , rest , shelter , and take no outrageous risks of glory . paul learns much from this man , who becomes a surrogate father and mentor . ian holm plays a military school drill instructor who is a sadist . eventually his sadism goes too far and he is sent to the front lines where he exhibits cowardly actions that ironically result in his receiving a medal from the kaiser . patricia neal plays paul 's dying mother . paul has seen so much death that he is only able to show dispassionate empathy with his mother and tells her lies about the front lines so that she does not die of cancer worrying about her son . donald pleasance plays a high school instructor who fills the heads of young men on concepts of national glory , heroism , manhood , and other nonsense to which 18 year old boys fall victim . the oddessey of pain is carefully told as paul experiences one loss and disillusionment after another . the tired eyes of the german infantry speak volumes as the kaiser urges them on to give their lives for the fatherland . paul 's return home is a wonderful turn in the film as he finds that his father and the older fellows have no idea of the reality and horror of the war . they make simplistic overgeneralized comments such as 'the war will be won if we surround them ' and other such nonsense . paul 's eyes glaze over as they discuss these abstractions while his young friends die in the muddy trenches . paul 's best friend , a gymnast and forrester , dies after a leg amputation . paul tells his mother a story that her son died immediately and painlessless , which is far from the truth . she makes paul swear by everything he holds sacred that this is the truth . he does so . then she makes him swear by his own safe return home that this story is the truth . again , he does so . in this extremely painful scene we see that paul has beent totally transformed by the war . he no longer believes in anything but his ability to periodically protect himself and others against random and senseless violence and pain . he also realizes that he is no longer able to feel comfortable in his past or in the land of the living away from the war . he returns to the front lines fully expecting that the random nature of war may soon take him . exceptionally well done , this is a film every family should see . it is only when peopel face the reality of war rather than the abstractions that war would ever end .
1	james mangold identity is one hell of a movie . the twist is amazing , did n't see that coming . the ending will shock you to pieces . john cusack and amanda peet are superb in their roles , he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to flordia . clea duvall also appears in this film , duvall was previously in girl , interrupted ( another mangold film ) . this film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes . great direction , top-notch acting , and awesome plot . identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time , i highly recommend this engrossing little film
1	meet me in st. louis takes a war-torn america back to a simpler time , a time when telephones were new and everyone was talking about the world 's fair . the smith family is very close , and although each of them have their problems , they share their lives with each other . esther ( judy garland ) has a crush on `` the boy next door , '' and sings a beautiful song about him . rose ( lucille bremer ) hopes to be proposed to , even if it is over the telephone . tootie ( margaret o'brien ) has a fascination with death and a wants to be included with the older kids . everyone 's lives are changed , however , when they hear that their father is going to move everyone to new york for his job . there are plenty of great songs here , and although many of them sound like show-tunes , they enhance the film quite well . aside from `` the boy next door , '' we have the famous `` trolley song , '' as well as the now-classic `` have yourself a merry little christmas '' and a fun number called `` under the bamboo tree . '' of course , the main title song `` meet me in st. louis '' is run throughout the film . you might think the story is rather silly and unrealistic , but it is actually based on the memoirs of the woman that tootie 's character is based on . one can learn all about it and other behind the scenes stories like about the romance that developed between garland and her director vincente minelli in the documentary also included on this vhs
0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 , it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story . wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download ! ! !
1	this is the best of the best . hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will ever see . colm wilkinson , lea salonga , michael ball are all amazing . fabulous talent , great singing
0	i 'm rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd . grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000 , without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade . this is certainly not worth the $ 20+ dollar price tag amazon.com has right now
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
1	ok this is like so many other sci-fi movies of the 80 's ( and the second of three underwater action movies that year ) that you always feel like you have seen it before . the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them . after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze.as two crew members drink from it they get very sick , and why not , it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster . not the greatest , but i had fun watching it and if gore and f/x 's are your thing you 'll love it
1	when darryl zanuck announced that he intended to produce a film version of john steinbeck 's depression-era novel , grapes of wrath , the industry was stunned ... they were all the more surprised when the resultant film , directed by john ford , proved to be one of hollywood 's finest achievement ... this story of a family of oklahoma sharecroppers who leave the oppressive poverty of the dust bowl in hope of finding a better life in californnia was told with all of ford 's considerable artistry , and it featured compelling performances by jane darwell as the matriarch of the clan and henry fonda as the son who is driven to radicalism by the intolerable conditions that grind his family down ... `` the grapes of wrath '' is a superb motion picture which could scarcely be improved upon ... acting , photography , direction combine to make this an unforgettable experience , a poem of a film ...
0	three problems with this film : 1 . pacing - the film 's pacing does n't vary . it 's very boring . as a matter of fact , this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense ( e.g. , `` speed '' ) , however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions , and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging . the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling `` horror '' scenes . furthermore , they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole . the upshot : the film relies too heavily on the art of editing , to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the `` so what ? '' question . the viewer is left with a sense of , `` i sat through the film for that ? '' in light of points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake . do n't waste your life . alon
1	boasting three shuddery tales ranging from gorgeous michelle mercier 's steamy telephone love triangle , to boris karloff in top form as an eerie russian vampire , to a sublimely creepy drop of water , this is one of the scariest horror films ever made . the great mario bava outdid himself with this superbly atmospheric 1963 film , which was recut , rescored , and dubbed by aip in such a way that the film as a whole , and `` the telephone '' segment in particular , was drastically altered from the original version presented here . it 's a pleasure to finally enjoy this film as bava intended it to be seen . this dvd version has only the original italian soundtrack with english subtitles , which is a shame since some of the actors are clearly speaking english on screen . a dubbed english soundtrack would have been a anice extra , along with les baxter 's excellent us musical score , but even so , what 's here is worth every penny . the extra scenes of karloff in the studio are a treat , and once seen , the restless corpse from `` the drop of water '' is never forgotten . i have left this review deliberately vague on plot points so as not to spoil the movie for those who have not yet seen it , but suffice to say that black sabbath is a masterwork that belongs in every horror fan 's collection
1	this is my favorite film , bar none . mpi home video is releasing this title on dvd 5/15/07 , according to mpi 's official site . in addition , as of this writing ( feb 07 ) , this stellar film is showing in theatrical re-release in as many as 30 american cities . this film has everything an epic should have : a first-rate cast , beautifully-written screenplay , spectacular ( and mostly historically accurate ) settings , even solid humor . i 've been waiting for this to be released on dvd for years
1	i love this movie . maybe it 's because it seemed so risque as a kid , or maybe it 's because jane hates it . whatever , it 's great fun . sure the script leaves much to be desired . and yea , the special effects suck . it was 1968 , what do you want ? but that only adds to its charm . it 's a funny movie , more on the silly side . this is true camp and if you like campy flicks , this one has to be in your collection
1	i really enjoyed this movie . the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job . if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you . this is a lighthearted movie that west-indian people can relate to on many levels . it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them . i have seen this alot . all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain . there is good music , dance and jokes cant done . latah
0	i hate this film and `` the ballad of cable hoge , '' because of its depiction of animal cruelty . this happens just at the prelude of both films .
1	this movie is about a bunch of cheerleaders that witness a murder that tommy jones has to take care of . the girls always walk around in short clothes and tommy struggles with the concept of he has to live with these women cheerleaders and he also cant find a way to talk to his daughter and these cheerleaders help him do that . and also help him with a date he has . if you like that type of stuff this movie is for you . its funny to me but everyone has an opinio
1	fantastic film ; memticulous and carefully built , loaded of the highest suspense you may expect . in this clever film noir , eastwood is an outsider . he is not a detective , but a jewel thief who watchs something he never had to see . this brutal murderer will reach the highest governement levels in which a very well planned chase will be made behind the traces of eastwood . a great script . hackman is absolute convincing in the best role which he has represented more than any one else ; the immoral , corrupt , decadent and perverse villain . intelligent puzzle and artistic film prove once more than industry and craft may join . one of the best films in his career .
1	i love this dvd , in fact i purchased 5 to give as baby shower extras ! i originally taped it from hbo , and my 3 grandchildren almost wore it out ! i was delighted to see it available on dvd , so i bought 5 , and am keeping one in my dvd library for my great-grandchildren some day to enjoy !
0	there are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when i can see a bright future for jennifer aniston 's light comedic talents , even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure `` friends '' persona . she plays sarah huttinger , a likeably insecure new york times obituary writer going home to pasadena to attend her younger sister annie 's wedding . sarah is picture-pretty , 33 and engaged to a nice , unflappable guy named jeff who accompanies her . at the same time , she 's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family . a ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family , her feisty , tart-tongued grandmother katherine , who tells sarah about her late mother 's pre-wedding tryst in mexico that gives rise to questions about sarah 's paternity . all the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy 's blessedly brief 96-minute running time , but screenwriter ted griffin hangs it all on the idea that sarah 's family may have been the inspiration for the robinsons in charles webb 's 1963 novel , `` the graduate '' , which of course , is the basis of mike nichols ' classic 1967 movie . the tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper , but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it . in fact , there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie , and director rob reiner is unable to overcome it because sarah 's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant . the dialogue never feels sharp , perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film . moreover , the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars ' ages . beyond aniston , a strong cast has been set adrift . playing katherine like an even more embittered variation on aurora greenway , shirley maclaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for mrs. robinson , even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are . as the aging but still magnetic benjamin braddock doppelganger , a high-tech mogul named beau burroughs , an overly sedate kevin costner barely registers in a smallish role . when he does , there is an insinuating , almost creepy quality in the way beau 's relationship with sarah evolves . until the end , mark ruffalo has little to do as jeff but wait patiently for sarah to resolve her personal dilemma . richard jenkins and mena suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of sarah 's passive father and bubbly sister , respectively . the 2006 dvd provides the original theatrical trailer ( which gives away most of the plot ) as its sole extra
0	pretty raw outlook in the life of basquiat i 'm an avid fan so i have no regrets having this
1	the legendary howard hawks directed this wwii classic about the mary ann , a b-17 bomber lead by captain john ridgely and featuring crew members gig young , harey carey , arthur kennedy , charles drake , george tobias , ray montgomery , and john garfield . on a routine mission to hawaii , the crew arrives just hours after the pearl harbor attack and find themselves thrust into war . other stops include wake island and the philippines . of course , one of the purposes of this film was to rally the american spirit , and it features some of the anti-japanese dialogue you 'd have to expect . but the film succeeds beyond the propaganda value . the action sequences are well filmed and exciting , with terrific aerial action and some good ground sequences , too . the camraderie amongst the crew is credible . each member has his own small `` back story '' as you would expect , but these fine character actors make it all very believable ( harry carey is a particular standout ) . this film is a true wwii classic
0	as usual , robert duvall 's acting was phenomenal - why i purchased the movie - but the movie itself was pointless and boring . my husband and i fell asleep ... ..when we woke up robert duvall 's character was dead ! enough said
0	this has already been expressed here in the reviews , but just as a reminder one more time ... .. this dvd is not the original version . the original version has more material and is much better . hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time .
1	a great movie for everyone ! from my 2 yr old to my folks !
1	one of the best movies of all time ! bertolucci captures it all : everything is well-rounded , every intimate moment realistically captured , the scenes , the emotion , the beauty and the avant guarde . this is avant-guarde cinema at its best , it does n't isolate the viewer , but wholeheartedly brings them into a brave new beautiful world . lucy is leisurely looking for her father , life and love in an isolated arts commune in italy . you will forget where you are and how you think you should be living after seeing such free and open beauty of people and interchanging lives . gorgeous
1	this film is a stunning tribute to the memory of all the victims of this tragedy , and to all the heros who contributed to our triumph of the american spirit
1	`` prom night '' is another of my favorite early slashers . i love the disco soundtrack and the whole late 70 's feel of the movie . ever since i saw halloween i craved more jamie lee curtis and this gives you a healthy dose . the plot is pretty usual but the killer was n't predictable like a lot of slasher movies . it 's a horror/slasher classic , not much gore but still effective . can i say as a woman i would never take a ride from a fat boy in a van~ ! ! jude~ ! what were you feelin girl ? and in the 70 's and 80 's slashers the jocks usually did n't have any muscles but the girls always had big [ ... ] . go figure . anyway..buy the movie it 's slasher royalty .
0	after watching `` anthropophagus- the grim reaper '' , i came away with mixed feelings . on the one hand , `` anthropohagus '' had its moments ( albeit quite few ) where it was somewhat chilling . the anthropohagus , himself , was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain . some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror , but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between . unfortunately , the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie , and for some reason , it is just very difficult to get over this fact in `` anthropophagus '' probably because these weaknesses are so glaring . `` anthropophagus '' may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes , so the gore-hound should n't be disappointed with this flick . however , with that being said , `` anthropophagus '' simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience , and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love . ultimately , what you have in `` anthropophagus '' is horrible acting , a poorly written screenplay , uneven and poorly developed plot and action , below average plot execution , just a couple of scary moments , some laughable scenes , a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting , deplorable and depraved scene of violence ( fetus scene ) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that i 've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror . if that kind of thing appeals to you , this could be right up your alley , but it does n't do much for me . i would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension , suspense and a scary story , and you simply do not get that in `` anthropophagus '' . to answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie ... did `` anthropophagus '' bother me ? no . did i think it was scary ? certainly not , laughable at some points in the movie but not scary , and nor did i find it disturbing . however , it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget italian-made horror flick ? touche ! in my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack , what did i find in `` anthropophagus '' but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline . indeed , it is very difficult to give this movie any credit . a word of advice , if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings ( like i did with this one ) , it probably just sucks . for all intents and purposes , that is the case with `` anthropophagus-the grim reaper '' . nevertheless , sadly , i 've seen much , much worse .
0	i only liked it when pinnochio talked . that was funny , but the rest of the movie was discusting . some of the scens were very sick ( not the blood , but other things ) . there was no blood hardly , and i could have made it alot better . i espected a good film but it was ... and i would never see it again
0	one of the most pretentious and exaggerating movies ever seen . the dialogue , the acting ... whatever , all suck big time . everything in this movie looked unrealistic , not funny but pathetically pretentious and exaggerating to the extreme . that kinda performance would have won an oscar , yeah , right , maybe just because there were only worse pictures nominated in that year . what a hype
1	this was not the scariest film i 've ever seen , and i really ca n't take horror very well . but it was good , because there was beauty in it , and that is quite rare in horror films . i think the idea of the film was very good , and surprise in the end too , even though the plot was not so brilliant . i actually liked it . i 'll probablu rent it again and watch it this time with sound .
1	movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas about _teenage gays coming out of the closet ! _ are so plentiful , they sometimes run together in my mind . `` edge of seventeen '' is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way . the screenplay by todd stephens is sensitive and true to life , or rather , many people 's lives . it tells the story of eric ( chris stafford ) , a young man growing up in the small town of sandusky , ohio , who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation . what is so refreshing about the script is that eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero ; he 's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself . eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless ; other times sweet and naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally a good guy ... in other words : completely human . that holds true of the other characters in the movie , including eric 's parents who love him dearly but are n't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings for him ; and his new gay `` family '' ( headed by lea delaria ) who are fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and does n't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package ; at the end of the movie , there 's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live , learn , make mistakes , and thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? ) the entire cast is uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric in all his complexity ; his performance never strikes a false note . tina holmes is amazing as his confused female friend ; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young meryl streep ( a high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself as eric 's baffled mother , and andersen gabrych is fine as eric 's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart . perhaps best of all is comic lea delaria , who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the earth mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to eric , regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away . the strand dvd offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video . the somewhat sparse extras are limited to the theatrical trailers for `` edge of seventeen '' and five other feature films designed to appeal to lgbt audiences . it would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers , but this is a small complaint . overall , this is truly a must-see film , one that is worthy of repeat viewings .
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	as a lover of many types of music , this movie sparked my interest ... .so i rented it . i found myself thinking throughout the movie `` i ca n't believe i 'm actually watching this . what a waste ! '' not only was the plot slow to the point of boring , but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that i ( as a grown woman ) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes . the small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story . also , please carefully consider before allowing children to watch ! ! i will never , under any circumstances watch this movie again . ( i want the reader to know that i am in no way a movie critic . i am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what i found to be a complete waste of an evening .
0	i had the clever idea to compare this version with the new movie . what a mistake . the original pink panther is an absolute bore . there is really no story . essentially , peter sellers spends much of the movie trying to get his wife in bed . major parts of the story make no sense . do n't waste your time
1	fascinating , educating , beautifully done . congratulations to the film maker and the sound maker . a story in music louder than words
1	the price on this is a bit steep , especially since the bonus materials are limited ( though enjoyable ) . nonetheless , i did n't regret spending the money . the maysles brothers were such amazing and groundbreaking documentarians that anything of theirs that you can get your hands on is worth it . this film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen in the late 1960 's as they ply their trade in the cold and snow of new england and then in the sunshine of florida . the maysles ' focus in particular on one gentleman who clearly is not cut out for this work and is slowly but surely headed for the scrap pile . despite the relative mundanity of the events , you find yourself transfixed as these men endure the high-powered mindwashing of their superiors and struggle to survive in a dying industry . few films have ever so poignantly made the point that , though god may be good box office , no one really seems to give a damn about who buys or sells the tickets to the show
1	a light hearted but still kind of sas movie . poweful
1	this is one of my favorite movies ever . it really captures life in the 1800 's slums and you really get attached to the characters . there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters . this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams . i 've seen this movie about 3 times and each time i see it , it is just as good
1	micky dane ( robert patrick ) , a paparazzo photographer , is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder . this movie has great action , good acting and really catchy music . body shot is another robert patrick movie that i 've seen multiple times ( probably about 12 so far and still counting ) . you got ta love patrick with his blond hair ! i am biased and give this a perfect 5 stars
0	the move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen . there are no special features and no chapter stops , this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd . i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it
1	i have owned wild orchid for quite a few years and from the beginning thought it was a bit out there . some of it does n't fit , some of it does n't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb . the reason i gave it 4 stars is because i like mickey rourke . even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex . carre otis 's character , emily , seems a bit aloof and childlike . she is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building , watching 2 people have sex in a limo . wheeler ( mickey rourke ) almost seems to enjoy watching emily squirm a bit . wheeler is sort of detached , but wanting someone he can trust . its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end . now i have the unrated version so it shows more than the r-rating ( for a movie like this one - unrated or nc-17 is the way to go ) -the part where wheeler and emily make love finally . it is very arousing to say the least . i must give it to zalman king . he knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind , but yet he does n't go for the gratuitous sex . i suggest delta of venus , which is another zalman king experience
0	slow , dull and done on the `` cheap '' ... .stick with `` zulu '' and read your history book 's ... .far more entertaining
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
0	so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing . well , anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing , awesome , good , or ok , has never actually seen salsa dancing ! ! i am a salsa dancer , and this movie was horrible ! ! ! i have seen amazing dancing , and good dancing . this was terrible dancing ! and there was hardly any salsa ! it was 80s dancing to salsa music ! that 's it . the only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner . other than that , it was just 80s dancing to salsa music . that 's it . if you want to see salsa dancing , i definitely do not recommend this movie . if you want to see horrible acting , and old 80s dancing , then i recommend this movie ... there was only one thing that i liked about this movie . the appearances made by tito puente and celia cruz . that was great to see , but not worth buying the movie for ... . oh , and the story line ? what was it again ? ? ? ? yeah ... i love movies , good ones and bad ones . but this one ? ? ? the worst movie i have seen so far ... to the best of my knowledge , there are n't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing . hopefully , someday , there will be
0	following orson welles ' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado . so much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm . take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries welles directed for british tv in the 1950s . `` the missing link in welles ' work , '' exults the snapcase boilerplate . this is a bit of an overstatement , given that far more significant works have n't seen the light of day ( `` don quixote '' and `` the other side of the wind , '' to name a couple ) . the documentaries do help to fill the gap in welles ' output for the 1950s , a decade in which he directed only three feature films . `` around the world '' is a good quality dvd and unquestionably the work of welles , but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of . the five episodes on this dvd explore various aspects of european culture . welles takes his camera in search of basque country , spanish bullfights , the idiosyncratic denizens of paris ' st germain des pres , and the loquacious and venerable chelsea pensioners . the `` st germain des pres '' episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter . welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes . after that , welles dashes through the town , capturing glimpses of celebrities like jean cocteau and eddie constantine ( `` lemmy caution '' ) , before discovering a group of `` letterists '' who are dedicated to ( you guessed it ) inventing new letters . unfortunately , welles ' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression . despite the exotic and obscure locales , most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews , captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of welles inserted to break up the monotony . even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect ; welles ' camera is grounded in the stands , preventing him from getting involved in the action . only towards the end of `` st. germain des pres '' and in the second basque episode does welles get inventive , developing the active , swirling camera style he employed in films like `` mr . arkadin . '' like a record that 's worth owning for one or two songs , `` around the world with orson welles '' does have one episode that justifies its purchase : the second basque episode . true , the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first basque show , but after that welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote ' ( a game similar to jai alai ) . welles gets his camera into the pelote action , and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter . an 11-year old boy joins welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show . the episode ends dramatically , with welles quoting a basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks . for a better example of welles ' creativity in the documentary genre , check out his 1974 essay film , `` f for fake , '' just released on dvd . `` around the world with orson welles '' is a far more pedestrian effort , but it does give welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not-too-distant horizon
0	what this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes did n't help either . bruce willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his bob moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group , bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective . there is also a young atractive woman played by jane march who gets involved with bruce willis 's character dr. bill capa , the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller . now i 'm not a big fan of bruce willis but i have seen much better films with him in it than this including die hard trilogy , last man standing and the sixth sense
1	as an asian american , i just want to say how well this movie is made . i 'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors ( come on people , this was in the 1930s ! ! ) and yes , there are a few scenes that are not in the book . but , let 's count how many hollywood movies ( taken from books ) that ca n't hold a candle to it 's original masterpiece . i love the movie 'misery ' but if you 've read the book , the book outshines the movie by a landslide . so yes , the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book , but still a very well made movie nonetheless , particularly for the 1930s . i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd
0	if you are looking for a good story and character development , this movie dissapoints . the story is rather thin and slow with more focus on joe 's good looks . a irritatating aspect of the dvd was white flashes occuring at innapropriate moments during the movie
1	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film . the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness . welles is excellent as edward rochester , the tormented master of the house . joan fountaine is wonderful as jane . look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles . this material has been done many times but watch this version
1	charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as england 's king , henry the eigth , who infamously married six different queens , divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted . the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs , touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn , concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty , capacious king . laughton , as ever , is a marvel , skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout , and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity . viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point : this is all about the cleverly-rendered script , which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads , and on the classy ensemble acting , which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print ( i 'm writing in the year 2003 ; perhaps criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon ) . still , fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot
0	the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst , josh hartnett , kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline . this film is directed by sofia coppola ( lost in translation ) , i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself , you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time . sometimes magic does not stirke twice . how can all five sisters end up killing themselves , their homelife was n't that unbearable , a lot of parents are religious , but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide . kristen dunst just gets on my nerves , her acting is the same in every film . do n't believe the hype , the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking , poetic film
0	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen , of course , but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x-person or a bond-busting sadist . this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh . and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt . carter from gomer pyle - totally implausible . i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them
1	love that era of movies . acting was grea
1	i thought george stevens ' impeccably crafted and literate the greatest story ever told ( 1965 ) was the finest life of jesus christ on film . then i took another look recently at director nicholas ray 's king of kings ( 1961 ) and changed my mind . i do n't know what the best life of jesus is , but king of kings has a charismatic and sympathetic christ ( jeffrey hunter in the performance of his career ) , a great john the baptist ( robert ryan ) , the definitive salome 's dance ( luscious brigid bazlen ) and the ultimate sermon on the mount ( with 7,000 extras on a spanish hillside ) , a striking last supper with disciples sitting at a y-shaped bench , a strong crucifixion , and a reverent resurrection . at 171 minutes ( including ten minutes of miklos rozsa music ) , samuel bronston 's production seems the ideal length to tell the story of christ . the screenplay is by oscar winner philip yordan . i have often had trouble with ron randell as the roman lucius ; he is a major character here and only a cameo in other biblical epics . same with harry guardino as barabbas . they are , in actuality , the second and third most important characters in ray 's film . but both actors are magnificent . lucius lets us inside the roman power circle to understand the roman way of thinking , so it is nice to have his role be big . and barabbas answers the question a lot of viewers may ponder , namely who was this convicted killer whom the crowd chose to live while jesus died . the movie , narrated by orson welles , starts the story with pompey in judea in 63 b.c . this helps give us information on what judea was like in the several decades before jesus was born . among a superb supporting cast are siobhan mckenna as mary , royal dano as peter , hurd hatfield as pontius pilate , viveca lindfors as herod antipas ' mistress , frank thring as herod antipas , and many more . the sets and costumes are gloriously colorful ; what was the academy thinking when they were not nominated for oscars in 1961 , along with no cast mermbers or screenplay ? rozsa 's music is glorious . and the movie is presented on dvd in about a 2.2 ratio for 70mm super technirama . king of kings is powerful , intelligent , colorful , and reverent . i think jesus himself would be impressed by it .
1	scary movie is an instant movie classic.director keenan ivory wayans outdies himself in a spoof of horror films involving an innocent teenager named cindy campbell who 's being stalked by a goofy killer in a cheap rendition of scream.though funny to watch , scary movie also has it 's share of gross-out gags and laughs.the way wayans slanders horror films is so funny that you ca n't help but laugh out loud
1	most of the other reviews printed here i am in agreement with . there is little i need to add except that i saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape . i just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some . schlesinger 's work , the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing , sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek `` happiness '' in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people . after the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film , i realized tonight how strong julie christie 's performance is in this film . there is not one hole in this bravura performance . it 's odd to make this statement , especially since she 's playing such a shallow role . it 's not an easy nor a desirable part to play , but she carries it off as if she herself were the character . selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity , and she stoops and conquers . laurence harvey has never played the rogue better and dirk bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart , but nevertheless gives in ( but not completely ) to ms. christie 's empty needs . he , indeed , sees through her throughout most of the film but can not help being swayed by her charms . emptiness served up brilliantly . and we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson -- as well as thank them ( on two levels at least : talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us )
0	if you are n't really into jokes about the difference between black/white , sex , drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you . i had seen other stuff by pryor i always liked but this time i never once really laughed out loud . it was dissapointing , good thing he has so many other good stuf
1	this movie is so stupid it is funny . i saw it when it first came out and i still have n't forgotten it nor will i ever . this is what the writers of the groove tube , saturday night live , and second city television are all about . watch this film and see a true comedy classic . individual skits like `` catholic high school girls in trouble '' could have been made into a full length movie all to itself . it was an era where one did n't have to be politically correct . this is what comedy is all about . forget the garbage we see today . forget martin lawrence or cedric the entertainer . see kentucky fried movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was . oh , by the way , stephen bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he is n't singing `` on and on ''
1	lucas is one of corey haim 's 80s greatest movies , i have the dvd , you too got ta go get it . : )
1	funny ... crazy ... you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it ... its terrible b movie material but so bad it 's actually good
1	the tale starts out with a historical reference to chaucer . for a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected . and then you see the michael powell and emeric pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day ( 1944 ) england . time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog . we find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to canterbury : u.s. army sergt . bob johnson ( u.s . sergeant john sweet ) on his way to canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of kent . he is accused of having his stripes on upside down . british sgt . peter gibbs ( dennis price ) is temporarily stationed at kent while staging for overseas . he was and theater organ player before the war . alison smith ( sheila sim ) a london store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `land girl ' . she seems to have an uncanny knowledge of kent and the pilgrims ' road to canterbury . the night they got off the train at kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious `` glue man '' . then befriended by the local magistrate , thomas colpeper , jp ( thomas colpeper , jp ) . mr. colpeper is interested in the history of the pilgrims ' road from kent to canterbury . until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you . is the focus on a local mystery ? the interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- be sure to get the criterion version with the second dvd . the main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian ian christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star .
1	yes this is `` worth it '' . i took my younger brother to three movies in our teens , apocalypse now , the deer hunter and spinal tap . being an older sis i can forget the near death face he wore after the first two ( of course he 'll never forget it ) but the utter outrage of his 14 year old zeppelin playing , doors 24/7-loving self displayed after tap ... ah that i recall ever after . ( usually to any girlfriend that comes around ) . he took it all to be actual documentary , no mockumentary concept for ken , and while i laughed myself into the aisles with jokes i still love ... he was incenced . `` what the hell kind of band is that ? `` ... he was livid . okay you had to be there but the only thing funnier than this movie is watching it with someone who is so rockraged they are arching off the walls . so seeing this lovely `` special edition '' off it went this july as his present for his 42nd birthday . `` very damn funny '' was my greeting . it 's a terrific present with added stuff to bring a few more laughs . admittedly nothing tops the stonehenge dance of the dwarves..but it 's just all fun . and more fun . if i could haul this in and show it as the first of the year teacher luncheon entertainment i could watch my brother 's routine all over again with most of the staff i work with just living in `` what is this `` land ... ah that would be supremely satisfying . send to someone today
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	i love this movie so much . i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance ( i know so random ) when i was in my teens . i went out and rented it right away , and i have watched it about 100 times since then . i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon . it 's such a sweet touching story . it 's a bit off the wall , but that 's of course what i love about it
1	contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has no subtitles or closed captions or whatever . the r2 neither . so again , do n't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff . non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format , no subs , not available at all ( yes i mean you , disney ) ... in short , no quality or consistency . go and take a hike . stop lobbying for legislation and start making real dvd 's
0	as the director and actors of this mess should , on their skinny french knees . complete waste of film and your time . not erotic , sexy ( ? was that actress really a woman ? , was her boyfriend really a man ? or visa/versa ) damned if i could tell . and that old man who tired her up , ya think he had enough rope ? the movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through . french people are not pretty , and this woman was not only not pretty , but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma . even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog . save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
1	this is a surprisingly good show . it manages to have 'a little ' violence , sex , and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid , and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting , humorous and kind of addicting to an adult . a modern nancy drew , is veronica mars . i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here ; i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well . i 'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest , i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks . i 'm glad i did
0	the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre , in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical , though different characters and locations are used . the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this `` remake '' is quite frankly terrible . bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors . the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman , which was fairly amusing but hardly essential , and a tacked on conspiracy theory . the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous , i wo n't explain it , theres no point , watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends . i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though , even die hards admit its awful , i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst ( yes even worse than this ! )
0	this film has been re-released as `` meltdown . '' there are a few reasons for watching this movie : 1 ) jet li . 2 ) chingmy yau ( the reporter ) . 3 ) wu ma ( frankie 's dad ) 4 ) a decent fight scene at the end . jacky cheung is also not as aggravating as usual . that 's it . jet li has appeared in three or four films directed by wong jing , and , just as chow yun fat does in god of gamblers and jackie chan does in city hunter , he does what he can . the direction of the film , however ( as well as gog and ch ) , stinks . the plot copies die hard and speed , with some broad satire aimed at jackie chan , but that is not the problem . put simply , jackie chan knows how to direct a film . wong jing does not . if you want to see jet li , go see fist of legend , once upon a time in china , or just about anything else he has done . if you want to see a good hong kong action movie , watch films directed by john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , jackie chan , and sammo hung . jet li is fun to watch , but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
0	reality bites seemed fresh when it was first released , giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of `` x '' - that was overeducated , underemployed , plagued by the flashy , trashy commercialism of mtv , and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college . it was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass , cruel arena of materialism can be tough , providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies . instead we have a swan dive into a pizza hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930 . winona ryder is winning as lelaina , but one can only imagine the sats of football players at a college where she is valedictorian . her `` documentary '' is appallingly narcissistic , reflecting the characteristic gen x notion that - `` if it 's about me , it 's art , and it 's important . '' ethan hawke does an excellent job as troy , the very archetype of self-satisfied , supercilious entitlement . we are expected to root for him , but it 's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus . stiller , who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays michael , the `` anti-troy . '' smooth , successful , and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of gen x culture - if culture is the right word - he 's an executive at an mtv-ish corporation . that he improves lelaina 's preposterous `` documentary , '' rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity , is the film 's dirty little secret . viewers surprised by who wins lelaina 's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and liberace was gay . indeed , when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie . janeane garofalo is outstanding as always , and john mahoney shines as the tv morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact , a bastard . his performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on tv - than the rest of this film put together . in fact , reality is great , this picture would have benefited from some
0	a lonely traveler is out in the dessert ( looks like the same place that many great sci-fi movies were made ) in his 50 's pickup when he spots a strange light . meanwhile back at the laboratory an unusual meteor is being tracked on its way to earth . what do they have in common ? the dr. leslie gaskell ( jeff morrow ) suspects that there is some nefarious plot from outer space . they could be right . but can he prove it ? this movie is missing the front-end dialog familiar with the classics of the era . they just used the word kronos because they must have thought it sounded nifty like the giant , this of course is misleading as it makes you think it has something to do with time . there is a love interest between gaskell ( jeff morrow ) and vera hunter ( barbara lawrence ) . a fun side interest was looking at al the fancy scientific equipment circa 50 's concept . the menacing device is hockey may have had too small of a budget .
0	this is one of our favorite movies ... ..but , when we sat down to enjoy it , the last 2 scene segments would not play . very unsettling
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon . the quality . sure , you can watch it for free on cbs , but the quality is n't very good . it 's streamed and the bitrate ( quality ) is low . personally , i want to watch survivor on my 50 '' plasma , not on my computer screen . so , i use unbox + windows media center to make that happen . survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider .
0	i saw this movie as a kid when it came out and liked it , but since then it has gone through something of a critical reevaluation . goodman is an entertaining actor , but there are just too many factual errors , and they arguably detract too much from the film 's quality . as was noted elsewhere by other reviewers , goodman 's ruth does not represent a great athlete . ruth was not overweight growing up , nor in his early days as a ballplayer . ruth 's weight did fluctuate , but few to this day know that ruth had 123 career stolen bases , and actually led the yankees in steals one year ( 1923 ) . goodman 's character was unreasonably slow , and at the end was portrayed as unable to run the bases even on a home run . this might work as light humor , but it certainly is not fact . also of note , goodman was a natural born right-hander that had to learn how to bat and throw left-handed like ruth for the purpose of acting in this film . this makes goodman look awkward , and even less like an athlete on a few occasions . on the other hand , i understand as a general rule that playwrights and filmmakers are given a certain `` artistic license , '' and that it is alright on some occasions to stretch the truth for a purpose . the bloated portrayal of ruth might be one such example , no matter how erroneous it is from a factual standpoint . even so , many of the inaccuracies have no discernable purpose . case in point , `` jumpin ' joe '' dugan was never a teammate of ruth 's in boston , only in new york . it is also known that ruth did not have any home runs in 1914 , but according to this movie he had one that year . in addition , ruth was not the first player to hit a home run at forbes field . the list could go on for a while , and there seems to be no reason why the filmmakers decided to alter such facts . `` jumpin ' joe '' may have been put in there just to have a veteran teammate friend for ruth , but dugan started his career three years after ruth did , so he could not have been a veteran to ruth at any point in his career . they could have picked someone else to fill this fictitious `` veteran teammate '' role , or scrapped the idea all together . the 1914 home run served the purpose of providing a dramatic rookie year home run , but this scene could have been set in 1915 instead , and with some modifications perhaps could have been just as dramatic . lastly , regarding forbes field , the announcer could have said a true statement along the lines of `` forbes field is a pitchers ballpark , not many home runs are hit here folks , '' as opposed to the inaccurate `` no one has ever hit a ball out of forbes field . '' the latter line had a dramatic effect , but was not necessary . also of note , ruth 's supposed `` meeting '' with gangster alphonse capone seemed a bit absurd , perhaps this was thrown in to get a glimpse of the times . aside from the dicey misrepresentations though , there were a few strong qualities . the acting was strong overall , with ruth 's two wives giving strong performances , and goodman 's performance was not a total wash , even if there was too much over-the-top buffoonery . and let it be said that this film does have the ability to evoke some of the excitement of the game of baseball - a sentiment especially felt as an eight or nine year old viewer . but as said by derek armstrong , there were `` too few ambitions toward a greatness to match that of its subject matter . ''
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
1	the title of this movie holds no secrets . the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom . almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic , between the acting and a great story line , but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions
0	`` cyrano '' is one of the greatest verse plays ever written . unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano . he 's a great , clumsy side of beef , not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac . with the best will in the world , his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance . the english translation was especially commissioned for this film . it is undistinguished , prosy and dull . it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore . get the jose ferrer version . this one 's a dog
0	to be quite honest , although there was a stunning cast , the plot was gory . it was sweet and had it 's element of romance , but it was too morbid for me to enjoy . if you are watching for drew barrymore , do n't bother . she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards . dean cain on the other hand looks mighty fine , if you 're after a gay man . it 's not the type of movie you want your children to watch . trust me
0	great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes . it gets stuck or restarts itself . very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd

1	good news mike leigh fans , this movie is now scheduled to be released on dvd on september 6 , 2005 according to amazon ! ! the movie is an excellent one . sometimes ( unjustly ) considered one of leigh 's lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world . told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain . a must for any and all mike leigh fans
1	freddy rules ! i remember growing up and being afraid of freddy.jason on the other hand never scared me to much.he was just a big dummy who walked slow.now watching the end of the movie how can anyone say jason won ? jason went down in the water and never came back till the end.freddy survived only to be killed by the teenagers them selves by slicing off his head.freedy won ! but anyway its not a bad movie .freddys make up looks great and glad to see him on the silver screen again
1	just got done watching the show and it was awesome . of course i had to download the tool , how else do you get started ? once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when i was ready . note to self get cable , dsl is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome . no commercials ! i did n't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it .
1	i saw this film at the old post office cinema in east hampton when it came out in limited release in 1976 . filming was done in 1974 at the mansion on west end road , now owned by ben bradley of the washington post . the film is great like the rest of the maysles films . i will pass along this little story . i was working as a desk officer at the old east hampton village police station on newtown lane about 30 years ago when little edie called me one winter afternoon.she reported an alien in a ufo flying around the yard of her house . so i sent a cop up to her mansion and it turned out it was a tree cutter in a cherry picker trimming trees of a neighbor . another note : the lead detective in the 1972 raid of the beale 's house , is now the mayor of that charming village
0	throughly dismisses all jazz after 1960 , including fusion , free jazz , and everything thereafter . marsalis actually calls cecil taylor 's music `` self-indulgent bullsh** '' apparently taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film . how was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual ( but more likely agenda-driven ) on pbs , i will never understand . if you think swing is the only valid form of jazz , you will love this series . if you think coltrane is a god , you get five minutes ' summary . so lets see here : 15 hours on louis armstrong and duke , 5 minutes on coletrane , and a total didmissal of everything after duke 's death . reminds me of the republisuck 's `` fair and balanced '' nonsense . pbs , this is your wake-up call . stop trying to rewrite history - jazz ai n't in a museum . just ask the artists ( most of whom are alive ) whom burns left out . metheny , you out there
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
1	good workout video for only 15 min . per session.after doing the video for 2 weeks straight i could tell the difference.my only complaint was that tamilee does n't give very explicit instructions for all of the moves.it was a little hard to follow at first.if you are looking for a decent workout for a small amount of time , this is a good choice
0	sorry i could n't come up with a better punchline , but this movie does n't deserve any original thought or ideas . maybe its because there are n't any original ideas in this movie event . national lampoon used to mean funny , now its french for crapola . avoid this one at all costs ! ! ! watch caddyshack ii , airplane ii , yes even xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one
1	i had seen this film a number of times either on t.v . or by me popping it in on my dvd player . denzel washington and sarita choudhury are a pleasure to watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a africa american male and an indian woman , whom both has never been to there native land , and how their romance causes strife in a small southern town . the movie handles the reactions by both families to the interracial union of mina and demetrius . against all this , a subplot in the story revolves around the loss of a homeland and friendship between choudhury 's proud ugandan national father and the black ugandan friend he left behind during idi amin 's reign of terror . there are very few movies that can capture the emotions that go along with such a sensitive and controversial matter . most importantly the opinions , thoughts , and traditions , both negative and positive , of both the indian and black communities are fairly communicated through the movie . a must see film and the only one i 'm aware of that explores the relationship between african americans and ethnic indians .
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father . a must see
0	this review may sound pretentious and ignorant , but in truth i 'm a big fan of british history , so bear with me ! even as a film itself , it 's surreal , and i do n't like the acting . but as with any historical film that includes the british , they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france ( i.e . the hundred years war ) , but rapists and murdering pillagers ! ? never ! historically accurate , full of british sentiment , and down-right weird . avoid this film today , folks !
0	painfully bad . i want my money back . listen to bob 's albums , but stay far away from this movie . so many great actors , but the story is nonsense . the characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes . unnatural dialogue . poorly lit . poorly directed . poorly edited . and bob could n't act his way out of a paper bag . stone-faced , frail , semi-catatonic ; completely devoid of charisma . it 's his vanity project , but he comes off looking ridiculous . even his musical performances are only so-so . the movie was shot entirely inside a hollywood studio ( except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown la ) , making it look fake and crowded . a case in point : jeff bridges and john goodman . amazing together in the big lebowski . both appear here as flat , irritating , one-dimensional characters . it 's a bummer , man
0	i just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great . but i felt kind of let down after watching it . it starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction , but we really do n't get to know any of them that well , except maybe kurt russell , so who really cares who dies ? there 's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship ; everything is fine , then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen , richard dreyfuss looks outside , and the wave hits ; it 's not all that intense . then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship . but it gets kind of repetetive and boring , because they just go from one room to another . it 's like they get into one room , someone says `` here , this is the only way out . '' someone else says that maybe there 's another way , but the other person says there is n't , then the water 's coming , so they have to get out of that room quickly . when they make their way into the next room , it 's the same thing over and over again . when they finally get off of the ship , they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off . then a guy shoots a flare , helicopters come , and the movie 's over . so basically , this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over . this is one movie i know i wo n't be buying
1	i found la ciudad a very different movie from any other movies i have wathched . this movie is split into four narratives of latino immigrants living in the city of new york . immigrants come to the us with many dreams in their minds . these dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education , getting rich , and living a happy and high standard life . this movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government . this movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations . for example , luis 's daughter dulce can not get addmission to school , and ana can not do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with ana . i like it how the movie is shown in black and white ; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie . it also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the us , they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations . overall , i really liked the movie and i would encourage anyone to see it
0	if you 've seen one you 've seen them all . uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl , she brings him out of his shell . well , i bought this for like two dollars , and maybe it was worth it . i watch it like once a year . no special features on dvd worth mentioning . ben affleck is getting married , he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding . but things keep getting in his way . forces of nature . also , he keeps running into , and ca n't seem to get away from , some weird chick ( bullock ) . are these signs ? should he stop being so uptight , and go with this free-spirited chick ? or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle ? the acting in this movie is `` meh '' , meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie ; and affleck sucks , as usual . the other small parts are well done , for the most part . the script is formulaic , and the cinematography at times is interesting . it 's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell . the movie opens with a stripper scene , no nudity . there is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie . there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar . just thought i 'd throw that in , in case you 're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something , and that kind of thing bothers you . you only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic , or a big fan of either affleck or bullock . otherwise this is completely forgettable .
0	this movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting . i found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying
1	`` the great director , '' volume 2 in the `` unknown chaplin '' series from thames television , looks at chaplin working on some of his biggest films , including `` the kid , '' `` the gold rush '' and my personal favorite , `` city lights . '' the chief assets of this documentary are the treasures found in the chaplin family private film vault , including discarded sequences and home movies never before seen by the public . there are also interviews with jackie coogan , lita grey , virginia cherrill and others who worked with chaplin . the emphasis remains on how chaplin worked , beginning with simple sight gags and slapstick and transforming them into comic masterpieces . this volume also gets into a bit more of chaplin 's artistic temperament , especially when his patience ran thin with cherrill and he temporarily replaced her with grey as the blind girl in `` city lights . '' there are even clips of the film 's classic ending shot with grey . kevin brownlow and david gill were given access to these unseen films by oona chaplin and they make the most of it in providing a portrait of a great artist at work . james mason provides the narration , managing to sound like a college professor lecturing students and at the same time like a fan of chaplin 's comic genius . whether you have seen a few or all of chaplin 's films , `` unknown chaplin '' is an absolute treat
0	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen , of course , but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x-person or a bond-busting sadist . this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh . and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt . carter from gomer pyle - totally implausible . i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them
1	this movie is great . i remember watching it when i was really young . im 21 now and still love it . yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great . its not suppose to be realistic . its fiction ! i just realized too that the daughter is the girl from american pie which makes it even funnier . overall this movie is pretty good . if you dont care for the story , atleast get it to see kim and the other chicks in the movie . if you 've never seen the movie , just buy it . its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it . for all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues !
1	my almost 3 year old loves it . she does n't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited ' but she 's been able to overlook them . she and i love the music together . that 's why i bought it in the first place
0	this a dreadful example of what jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers . the only reason to watch it would be because mamie van doren was also in it.but be aware ( and i read that in a biography about jayne ) that in their contracts was specified that they would not appear together in any scene whatsoever.so you see them separately in different scenes.also be aware that if you blink , you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties . conclusion : get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''ol ' south ' , or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode . not only did i get charged , but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge - i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund . once it finished downloading , it did n't play anyway . i gave up .
0	i agree with most of the reviews here that the movie is just so bad . the director had the wrong idea of an art film , methophors and strange incoherrent ending is not the only thing you need to make an art film . i was pretty intrigued by the lead 's obssession with the hunky swimmer but it just did not end the movie satisfactorily ... can anyone explain like when did he have the rubber suite , whats with the garbage dump ending , it is just too pointless ! ! ! i felt cheated of 90 mins of my life
1	what more can be said about this film ? filmed on location in rome , italy in the fifties . greg peck and audrey hep . nuff said
1	i really liked this film . it 's not a groundbreaking movie in any way , though . it 's about a bunch of underdog kids who are n't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds . throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented ( and unlikeable ) team . it 's pretty much the same thing we 've seen in the mighty ducks except now it 's about football . it 's just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you 're small and think you do n't have any talent , you actually do have the talent to play football , hockey , basketball , whatever . one of the characters is a girl who does n't know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls . rick moranis once again plays that shy , quiet character he does so well in other films such as honey i shrunk the kids . it 's hard to believe he 's now a country singer ( no , i 'm not kidding ) . ed o'neil does n't quite play the jerk character you 'd expect from the married with children show . he 's not really a nice guy either , though . i find it interesting that the team names are the giants ( the good guys ) vs. the cowboys ( the bad guys ) because the monday night football game this week were those two teams facing each other ( with the giants winning )
0	i 'm sorry , but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film `` dick . '' `` dick '' is funny , this is not . i 'm sorry , but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst ( or that level of indefatigable cuteness ) . just go rent `` dick '' instead . you 'll thank me , yourself , and those fine ladies who saved our country
1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri-la and its elusive transcendental nature
1	this episode is a classic , and is one of the best in the series . it explores time travel and alternate time lines , and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed .
1	the movie is a bit dramatic at times , but those who have studied the doolittle raid and the treatment of the 8 men captured know it does not tell the american public enough about the terrible way humans treat other humans . if the americans had been able to know how badly their prisoners were being treated , the japanese island might not be there today . read four came home for the best view , or study other exerpts of various items on the internet . i am writing about dean edward hallmark , a graduate of paris junior college and one of the three who were executed
0	i could not help but to watch this film with all of my african american female sensibilities . despite the proficient acting , cinematography and directing , i found the content highly offensive and trite . mr. kinksy claimed to love shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections . he was put off to find out that shanduri was married , but not deterred . shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband , who was arrested for speaking out against the government , freed from an african prison . i recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer , however i know that it is extremely rare . ( ask any black woman who 's cleaned a white person 's house , `how much love do you have for your boss . ' the relationship between shanduri and mr. kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation . during the `relationship ' that i watched develop , not once did shanduri refer to her employer by his first name . clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control ... not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his african concubine . so , mr. kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions ; it was european influence that created the climate that allowed shanduri 's husband to be detained indefinitely . though i am one among several with a different review about the film , i have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people , especially white men . to see such a film is an insult and another example of how europeans do not understand the masses of african americans
0	after purchasing this i have only been able to watch it once . audrey hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she ( joanna in this ) is brilliant as always . however , albert finney 's roll ( mark ) , charactor and performance is in stark contrast . the further the movie goes the more i disliked mark and was angry that joanna was putting up with him . mark 's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable . five stars audrey , minus four albert
0	it 's always a pleasure to see fred 's legwork , but his relationship with hepburn is completely implausible due to huge age difference and weak plot
1	school house rock is mad awesome cool ! i love all the song , like i 'm just a bill . i memorized the preamble cause of the preamble song thing . peac
1	jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot . while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism ( highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled `` conveniences '' and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain ) , it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long , and several scenes ( notably the garden party ) would have benefited by judicious paring . still , the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy .
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	i had been searching for this dvd for some time -- i was happy to find it here and i am very pleased with it . the sound is great and the video is very sharp . i would reccomend it
0	i thought , since this was a criterion collection flick , that it was gon na be a psychedelic , spaced-out trip through india with heavy ravi shankar music , incense , and flower children with bells and long hair trying to `` find themselves '' . it was about as far away from that as anyone could get , but it was weird nonetheless . basically , it 's the story of a bunch of rich white people living in india on some sort of plantation , far from the everyday realities of india itself in their luxurious palace . when i found out the plot i was immediately turned off , because i hate movies about rich white people , especially when they slum around in foreign countries ripping off the local economy through some sort of corporate pseudo-slave labor arrangement , sitting back on their plantations acting all sophisticated in white linen clothing . so anyway , the movie centers on this one white chick , harriet , and she is ugly . good grief , can she peel the paint off a wall . anyhow , she 's living on this plantation with her ritzy family and her one very bizarre younger brother who likes to play with his lizard or something . all of a sudden , some rich white heart-throb guy named captain john shows up and suddenly harriet gets it , her first crush , and she discovers something besides bad poetry and horses . she first visits him while he is at her neighbor 's house , which strikes me as a weird sort of sexual harem because the neighbor 's wife died and ever since then the neighbor apparently has the hots for a pre-pubescent indian girl . ( ah , the elegance of foreign lands , where there are no child exploitation laws . ) anyway , captain john is an american , a sleazy bohemian type that looks like a cross between harry chapin and eraserhead . he smokes cigarettes in a very sexual manner while galavanting around town in tommy bahama clothing . harriet invites him to a party at their ritzy family house ( called `` the big house '' , go figure ) and after she flirts with him non-stop , he decides to go for harriet 's sister , valerie , who looks like an impish meryl streep with a bad nose job . so , jilted by captain john for her own sister , harriet decides to stalk him all over the stereotypical `` indian village '' where we see all sorts of truly indian things like cobra-charming and a marketplace where you can buy tapestries made by children enslaved in sweatshops all over india . what i noticed at this point is that captain john looks about 30 , and harriet 's like 15 , but even though he 's fascinated with her in a quasi-sexual way , he plays hard-to-get . in a sad development , harriet says `` i have decided to conquer him '' , and attempts to seduce him by reading her bad poetry , which seems to amuse him , like , `` wow , i 've got a 15 year-old rich white chick who thinks i 'm the man '' . but the best part is that valerie , who we 've come to totally despise for being the ego princess from hell , steals harriet 's diary and reads it aloud to captain john ( which , of course contains bad love poetry about him ) . so the two sisters get in an all out brawl right in front of this guy , and he intervenes to cop a feel with both of them while `` breaking it up '' . harriet then storms off , which causes captain john to think valerie is a bitch for reading the diary . so valerie then `` plays '' with him by throwing a toy at him , which causes him to tear his hamstring , and he limps off in a hilarious scene , vowing never to hang out with her again . at this point , the movie turns really , really strange . suffice to say a third girl gets involved , and good ol ' captain john starts spreading himself a little too thin , keeping 3 juvenile girls hanging as he tries to figure out which one to pop first . however , tragedy strikes as valerie harriet 's brother ( the one with the lizard fetish ) gets a little too close to a pet cobra . the sad outcome gives everyone a big wake-up-call , and everyone gets real moody . the final outcome is an anti-climactic scene where harriet resumes her poetry-writing in a funk about failing to seduce a 30-year-old . this flick would n't be so bad if it were n't for the archaic screenplay , atrocious acting ( even for 1950 ) , and dull character development . i mean , it tries hard to be really `` indian '' , but it 's about as indian as a trip to the bombay company or pier 1 . most annoyingly , the movie itself would be no more than a half-hour in length if it were n't padded with very bizarre national geographic-style narrations about indian culture , complete with some british voice-over chick that makes it seem like a 3rd grade social studies filmstrip . ( at times i was waiting for the little `` beep '' to indicate where i needed to advance the frame . ) the footage of india is swell , in its weird early-technicolor restored glory , but after you get over that , the whole package strikes me as really contrived . i think of all the truly wonderful films that could stand the criterion treatment and it makes me wonder how they arrive at the decision to bother with crap like this
0	i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for 19 bucks and i am so glad that i did . that said , the first series is worth watching for two main reasons : overt lesbianism and jinnai . the former is self-explanatory while the latter ( jinnai ) is without a doubt the best character in the series ( despite the fact that he is the antagonist ) . you ca n't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed , but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character , as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature . this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story 's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging . and this is what makes the second series ( all four dismal episodes ) so tragic : they nerfed jinnai . he could never have been called a genius in the first series , but he was decidedly intelligent , cool , pragmatic , supremely self-confident and an effective leader ( even though he was also manic and delusional ) . in el hazard ii , as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain , they have turned jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon . i suggest purchasing el hazard through ... alternate means , ... watching the first series and discarding the second . let 's face it : even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty
0	rule number one if you 're making a stephen king movie , especially if it 's a tv movie ; make it scary or do n't make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film , you 're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions . granted , that 's all in the book , but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it . there are some exciting alien moments at the end , but by then it 's too late . you 've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x-files episode . on the plus side , i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy . this is my fourth video , and i 've only had problems with one , and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it . got ta agree with a. huck on the dsl , though . while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great
0	i get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide ! ? the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night . why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! ? ! ? it is not matching the character
1	there are a whole bunch of films from the 70 's that deserve a dvd release and this is one of them
0	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film . if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie .
0	there is no actualy snowboarding or skiing , its a boring chick flick with a ranting sissy main characte
0	fredro starr is a good actor.in fact what ever happened to the group onyx ? but this film is cliched and predictable.rhea perlman looks out of place.this is a 2nd tier above the rim
1	this story is so fascinating that i could n't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one 's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer , arenas , to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in cuba under castro . johnny depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting drag queen
1	i 'm delighted to see there are n't a string of 1 star reviews from people who do n't get a mighty wind . if it has a weakness , its that its played so dryly , its almost like non-fiction that just happens to be funny . thank god for fred willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these `` serious '' proceedings . i share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters . i 've never liked folk music . but somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times , without being too cynical itself . my one dissapointment is that we do n't get to see ed begley jr. sing how 's it hangin ' grandma ? in swedish . talk about a missed opportunity
0	the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting . an effort to watch . make-up , dyed hair , costumes poorly done . one man 's eyebrows , the suitor 's , are altered like a woman 's ! no scenery or homes of interest , except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor . not a pleasant pace , without humor , without intrigue . a lesbian undertone in one scene . the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen , quoted . fanny sums up in one sentence , why she will not marry him . women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty , will wish to sum up their certainty with ms. austen 's line : `` his sole interest is in being loved , not in loving '' . this line is an exception to a lifeless script . there , now you do not need to endure the painful movie . here are two lines re-written by me : for the woman dealing with a trifling man : `` no man suffers pains of love on the stage . '' for dealing with the infatuated man : `` you have wounded yourself , but not with love . '' this movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen . there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film , humorous , with singing , with interest . a movie can take the best of the book , in the spirit of the book , which this movie did not carry , and make a movie better than the book . this movie is bad any which way . well-made period romance films are : `` pride prejudice 2005 , 1996 , 1940 '' , `` wives daughters '' , `` north south '' . fairly made is `` under the greenwood tree '' . i rated `` persuasion '' at 2-stars for the wooden acting ; however `` persuasion '' is 5-stars compared to this `` mansfield park '' . `` persuasion '' has attractive scenery , costumes , beautiful singing , and an uplifting plot ; though of interest only to women , preferably who have already read the book .
1	in my opinion one of gary coopers greatest roles . the background story is excellent making this movie one you can watch over and over .
1	be forewarned those who may be driving in the desert at night on some dark , deserted piece of highway . stop for hitchhikers at your own risk . also avoid the urge of trying to be too helpful to fellow motorist stranded along the way . remember things are not always what they appear to be . this was quite a well-constructed , coherent storyline from beginning to end . you are never left in the dark with this plot . everything is explained at the appropriate time , the history of this particular vampire sect , how they happened to show up in midwest america , how the vampire virius works in the body , its telepathic properties and what must be done to cure yourself from the curse of `` the forsaken . '' all this infomation was nicely worked into the script in such a way as not to bog down the viewer with too much substance , hence detracting from what the average movie fan is looking for , gore and violence . a brief comment for any young girls who may get struck watching this with a boyfriend . while you may not enjoy the horror elements in the movie you might enjoy the male members of the cast which includes ; brendan fehr ( roswell ) , kerr smith ( dawson 's creek , final destination ) and johnathon schaech ( that thing you do ) as the head vampire . brendan fehr was terrific as the young , wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming the highways and byways in search of the vampire that infected him with the virius . my favorite scene in the movie is when nick ( brendan fehr ) and sean ( kerr smith ) stop at a roadside diner for a bite to eat . a two-way conversation quickly turns into a monologue when nick begins to compare the aspirations and hopes of his generation with those of the last . it 's not only hilarious , but absolutely true . without giving away too much of the ending , i 'll just say a perfect opening was provided for a sequel . while i 'm not generally a fan of sequels , i would 've liked to see brendan fehr reprise his role of vampire hunter at least one more time . simply the most enjoyable vampire film since `` the lost boys . ''
0	so not at all what i was expecting . i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it , i was terribly disappointed and confused .
1	i dont remember watching he man growing up , but i think i saw this movie . i watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical , and i was wrong . the preview really drew me into the movie before i watched it . it was pure fun , and an excellent sci fi movie . dolph lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie , thanks dolph ! where the heck are you these days ? i didnt check all reviews but at the very , very end of the movie skeltor comes on and says `` i 'll be back '' . ha ! guess that movie never happened .
1	the only reason i bought this movie , because it had anitra ford in it . pam grier plays the role of blossom , anitra ford plays the role of terry and sid haig plays the role of djanglo . terry is invite to go to a small tavern in town where blossom is singing . while their blossom and here thugs try to rob the place . terry is taken hostage by djanglo and thrown in a getaway car . when the local police catch up with the car djanglo jumps over the bridge leaving terry to fend for herself . despite her innocents , terry is sentence to life on a government work farm known as the big bird cage . when blossom tries to take at the local politicians . she is also sentence to the work farm . there blossom , terry and djanglo who 's undercover as a warden guard get together one more time . how does one escape from the work farm ? if you do escape , do you make out alive ? i first saw anitra ford on the price is right game show as a model with those gorgeous long legs . as far as i 'm concern anitra does an excellent showing for herself . if you like anitra ford then you like this picture .
0	this movie lacked the luster i expect from robert duvall . it was an endless journey into boredom , at least for me
1	i think simply put , if you like bob dylan and just want to have fun with a movie , then you 'll love it . the performances bob gives are excellent , and it 's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together . if your not much of a dylan fan , and like your movies high and mighty , better just pass it up..

0	everthing about this movie was bad . the acting , the story , the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor . the acting and production value was so bad that you 'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975 . how much did it cost them to film this movie ? 50 bucks ? the revenge of the nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with
0	this movie is far from being anything great . some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast . leatherface 's role has been mocked . people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface . the first tcm is a classic . and the second tcm is great as well . but leatherface : tcm iii , the next generation , and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock . i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up . the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi . enough is enough .
1	it 's hysterical and pitiful that some of the other 'reviewers ' describe this program as though it is some subversive , dangerous , dogmatic propaganda . warning : this program teaches children to love themselves and respect others and we all know how threatening and subversive those values are ! quick run back to the cave and hide ! the sky is falling ! ! if you believe little boys playing with dolls is sick and threatens their development , then you wo n't like this program . if you think it 's subservise propaganda to tell little girls it 's okay for them to be smart and strong , then you wo n't like this program either . on the other hand , if you are a nurturing parent and some of your goals include teaching your child to have a sense of self , to respect humanity 's differences ( gasp ! ) and to empower ( double gasp ! ) them to reach for the stars , then you 'll enjoy sharing this program with your kids
1	'the curse of the grebes ' is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon , timlin and renteria . timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb . 'arthur changes gears ' is also great , he gets a bike he 's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he 's so worried about getting it dirty that he wo n't ride it

1	setting theme ( s ) : castlerock , smallville , summer friends ' adventure , life 's lessons , solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown . this 1986 instant classic of rob reiner 's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film . the musical score is dramatic , it sets the tempo from start to finish , and it never misses a beat ; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie 's unfolding , and you do n't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding . the lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient , lazy summer days of grandeur , to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity . one can in stand by me favorably assume to watch : pie eating contests , leeches , trains , train dodging , mail ball , fancy cars , fancy footwork ( i.e . verno 's beloved comb 's freefall ) , cantenes ( thought they disappeared w/ ben franklin 's outlets ) , junkyard dog chases , and much much more . the ending is the real gravy . the narration is superb also . by far one of the favorite films of my youth . believe john cusack can be seen playing the role of gordy 's football star elder brother ? stand by me is the childhood that big city life just does n't afford , at least not anymore . everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses ; rustic destination spots , like the ones presented in this movie , are still out there folks . with a smidgen of ambition toward adventure , which will take your there , the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated . although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors . five stars for reiners finest photoplay .
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	into the blue turned out to be a decent movie . i was not expecting a story or anything from this movie other than pure eye candy . i was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography . the underwater shots are really breathtaking . i also enjoyed the special features on the dvd which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested . of course , aside from the beautiful underwater photography , there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world . jessica alba looks incredible . ashley scott is also gorgeous . and for the ladies , there 's paul walker and tyson beckford . i was n't expecting much from this film , but i was pleasantly surprised . it 's not going to win any academy awards , but it is entertaining and fun
0	in short , the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across , as it should do , in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act . at the same time , however , it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground , which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create . what the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective : not to choose sides . the catholic croats and the muslims are the `` victims , '' while the orthodox serbs are wholly to blame ... that is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a `` noble cause . '' there is a term used in such situations and it 's called ... propaganda ! a more balanced and objective approach ( i.e . there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts ) with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore , more successful . the ultimate goal is good , but the method used is not necessarily the correct one . another setback is in relation to the acting ( or lack of it ) ; that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons ( with the exception of woody harrelson ) ! the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words ... school plays ( and pre-school for that matter ) have better actors ! it is truly sad ... yet another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame . in conclusion , the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to ... write and direct ! a shame really ...
1	i do n't own any other superman movies but this one and it was a really good movie even though it was short.some of the parts were funny with joker in it and some were with action were superman fights batman and that part was my favorite and the voice of superman which was voiced by tim daly and superman 's voice was okay.this movie was the best that i rented it a few times and decided to get this movie on dvd and recently i found this at eb games for [ .. ] and it was the last copy they were selling , oh and here is my favorite line , ''it 's over , joker '' .that line was a good line and i never heard joker call superman ''supie '' and that name just made me laugh , but still this was a good movie and the charcters of this movie were not so bad after all and this movie is highly recommended to any superman/batman fan
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	i was aniticpatng a riveting documentary ... after reading some books on tibet , i thought this documentary would be especially enlightening . i found it to be slow paced , repetitive and thin on factual information ( factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the tibetan side of the chinese invasion/occupation ) and heavy on `` experiences and testimonials '' of certain tibetans . the bit about `` the american 's abandoned us '' was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off . not that this man felt abandoned ( i have the utmost compassion for his experiences ) , but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the `` evil communist chinese '' bits . overall , this documentary of the tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged ( i did cry at one point ) , too repetitive ( frankly , it gets boring ) , and too thin on ( non emotionally charged ) information .
0	having avoided seeing this film , i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on , brought `` tuesday ... '' unbiden into our home.my aversion to oprah and her ilk , does not cloud my dislike of this film . a bad film is a bad film.devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned , and directionless directing , this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned , to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward . something should occur , my interest should be engaged . this film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses , and attempts to build the plot from words alone . it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said , `` hey , this book is full of words , lets make a movie . `` in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.to be honest , jack lemmon was not very good in this film . he played the same character he always did . just older . hank azaria was just awful . he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones , and was wooden and expressionless . maybe he was too embarrased to be there . as to the other actor 's ; well they filled up the space nicely.the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality . the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was . they even covered the green leaves on the trees . some better acting , some good r rated dialogue , and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film . as it stands , however , it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr.phil , etc . the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs , but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases , a good cry , and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.i , for one , think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial . then pull the finger out , and just get on with it . ( to the grammar and form police : i did have this in paragraphs , but the editing process scrunched it all together . sorry
1	many people know about john wayne and john ford 's cavalry trilogy , three of the greatest westerns ever made , but another pairing between the two is not as well known . the three godfathers is a lesser-known john wayne classic when he was at the top of his game . starring harry carey jr. and pedro armendariz as the other two godfathers this classic should not be missed . these three outlaws ride into the desert after a bungled robbery only to find a dying woman with a newborn infant . the duke promises to care for the baby which she names robert william pedro hightower after the three outlaws . they must then make the trek across the desert with very little supplies to get the baby to the next town . excellent supporting cast with many recognizable faces from other duke movies , with ward bond playing the sheriff who attempts to track down the outlaws . truly funny scenes as wayne , armendariz , and carey attempt to care for the baby . as usual awesome scenery as is expected in john ford westerns . this is one classic that has to be put on dvd . a must have for john wayne fans
0	i saw the show on stage . i saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this . unfortunately , this is ann reinking 's version of bob fosse . reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential fosse dancer of the 70 's and 80 's created this tribute . the difference is ann reinking has taken the fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own . as a tribute to fosse this is inaccurate . therefore , for fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works . also , there is a too big reliance on his concept musical `` dancin ' '' . the one good thing in this is the addition of another fosse creation ben vereen . he shows why he can still pack a house . my suggestion is to rent fosse films like sweet charity and all that jazz . you 'll get to see the real fosse
0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage . the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver . the most interesting part is all the shark footage ... the best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten , the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat . this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot . so where did this hook come from ? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie
1	*** spoiler warning - this review might reveal surprises in the movie *** first off for a frame of reference , i 'm a 30-year old male and a sucker for disney movies in general . when this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash , i heard so much bad about it , how it was the worst disney movie ever , that i actually did n't go see it in the theatre . i regret that now . first time i actually saw this movie was on a 14-hour flight from los angeles to london , and i fell heads over heels in love with it ! i adored the original novel `` treasure island '' , and i believe that treasure planet lives up to it . the central theme of treasure planet , in my mind , is the boy , jim , who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in jim 's faded childhood memories . i think this particular `` flashback '' scene was very powerful , it featured the absolutely brilliant `` i 'm still here '' track by johnny rzesnik , and led the viewer to fully understand jim 's childhood , and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young jim and his mother . possibly , i might a bit biased in this respect , since i can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was `` married to the sea '' when i grew up , and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence . this is right in line with the core message of the film . a young , reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the old salt , who becomes his new father figure . he learns how to take orders , work hard , grow , face adversity , and eventually become a man by making tough choices . an excellent message in this day and age , if you ask me . i also loved the theme the producers chose . a type of anachronistic retro-futuristic design , where we in the future still use old , creaking , wooden , pirate ships , but with ultra futuristic systems . the movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways - for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe , it encounters a pod of whales . or how jim takes a dhingy `` comet surfing '' . i think this film provides excellent entertainment , suspense and has a great message for kids . but as an adult , i think i also got a kick out of this great and clearly underrated disney flick . see it
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father . a must see
0	everything is this movie seems out of place . the old cliche `` good cop-bad cop '' , lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance , totally unconvincing , unreal , flat . anyway , it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time .
1	this movie combines two things i love in a film : the actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents . this is an improv lover 's dream . and it makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously , in this case , dog shows . only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog 's rating in context . mainly though , it is just hilarious . some ( okay-a lot ) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately , and nearly too crude for me . still , it fits the genre .
1	a good movie ; a john wayne movie with a very nice cast , the usual harry carye jr.ben johnson , john agar , paul fix and many other great people . especially from the time it is great to see merlin olsen and roman gabriel from the football movie actor era . the added plus is we have rock hudson in the movie.not to forget the movies leading ladies lee meriweather , marian mccargo.the women are very nice looking and they would be if they were in rock hudson 's family . the time era of the film is after the american civil war . john wayne is your northerner and rock is from the south . the deep south . john wayne is with his loyal men who are finanical ruined after the war and need to take home money to their families when they return.they band together to run a herd legally.the rock is a family man who has lost everything even his country . the southerns are lured to mexico with false promises and high hopes . the northerners are going to do business with mexico also.john wayne and the men end up helping the southerns . enemies but john wayne and his men have honor and help the southerners.most importantly fellow americans . the civil war tore us apart and threw us together . there are great elements in the movie action , love , honor in people , human weaknesses , saddness , and some historical correctness . the movie is not anyone 's best movie but it is not the worse either . good entertainment with a good mix of plot and history . john wayne and the rock 's only movie together . the movie shows everyone in such great shape and takes you back to great movie times.watch and enjoy
1	it 's right on . the scene transitions are nicely done . even though a lot of this is predictable , it is still funny and makes one eager to see what 's ' next . fernando literally goes down the line of all the sisters , till he has a shot gun wedding with the last . the scene between the cuckold and the err ... cuckolded cuckold is hilarious . the sisters are very vivid and pretty ( well except that cruz girl ) . overall a very brilliantly done story
1	this is by far my favorite musical , not the concert but the actual musical from the 70 's . when i saw alexis smith the first time i fell deeply in love . of course i was only 24 at the time.even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it 's better than nothing at all . this cast was also wonderful with it 's vintage and well polished cast , i gave it the four stars only because it 's not as complete as the cd . after all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this dvd ? to all those wonderful women who were in the original production , , , hats off , to those wonderful girls.. the likes of this will never come again
0	warning ~ a bunch 'o ''spoilers '' and common sense alert ! ! ! why ) did the grand father have to be a perverted drug addict ? ? ? ? how i would have done it ) make him practicing for his upcoming geriactric pageant.honestly , the movie might have been better without him.most old folks are being portrayed as hippies , hipsters , sassy vixens and gruff guys anyway.this of course , would have killed off this movies 2nd biggest gimmick . why ) did the uncle have to be gay ? ? ? how i would have done it ) ok , a regular uncle isnt funny or gimmicky.how about a gambler ? ? ? an uncle whos depressed/suicidal over losing everything in poker while having only the second highest hand there is.not only that but he loses everything to the loan shark who happened to be at the same table . why ) were the parents so feeble ? ? ? how i would have done it ) first off , dont have anyone , relative or not , have control over a young child in your home.in real life , its not friends or neighbors who mess you up , but family members.i would have had the whole family participating in olives quest for shallowness.of course that would have killed the movies biggest gimmick . why ) wasnt there a pet added to the mix of ''dysfunction '' ( it was the only gimmick left untapped ) ? ? ? ? how i would have done it ) to replace the cursing , drug addict geezer and empty headed parents gimmicks , id toss in pet skunk , porcupine or rat.some animal thats not a popular choice but is loved nonetheless . why ) did olives routine have to be an audition for her future stripping gig ? ? ? ? how i would have done it ) while my idea wouldnt have been ''edgy '' , it would have been more original ... .have her be a magician and gramps be her ''eye candy '' assistant.even more , have her be good at it.get those ''ugly '' pets to par take as well.make the done up midgets and their loser parents feel ridiculous not by being outrageous but showing her talent/s.if contestants arent allowed to have assistants , no prob.have her be good at her tricks while still involving said animals and have rick james be her soundtrack.having olive win despite not being little miss pretty would have been the way id go . the stuff that worked ; dad having difficult time living his dream.son having will power of some sort attempting his ( not speaking is a good a choice as any ) .a family conflict of any kind and having them come through it even stronger.the bus . im not completely sure what message this little movie was trying to get across.dreams cant get crushed even though the ones you place your dreams success upon are the ones crushing them ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ( shrugs uncaring shoulders uncaringly
1	devotees of noir period pieces probably will not be as pleased with this as will the rest of this , but curtis hanson apparently decided that putting together a coherent well-crafted film was more important than remaining faithful to one particular genre or another . aside from specific historical references ( bloody christmas , for example ) , it is quite easy to forget that this is set in 1950 's los angeles . one could regard this as a shortcoming ( it is , nominally at least , supposed to be a period thriller ) or as an asset ( a really well-told story will trump all other details ) , depending on one 's perspective . in any case , hanson and a top-notch cast works with a pretty complex plot and manages to keep all of the balls in the air . i always enjoy a movie where the audience figures out most of the twists before the characters do , because then we get to enjoy watching the unfolding of consequences of decisions made or avoided . spacey , crowe pearce manage to give us wonderfully ambivalent complex characters , all of whom are far from being beyond reproach and continue to have some dubious motives right up to the film 's conclusion . personally , i always like a film that deliberately avoids a tidy ending and leaves the viewer knowing that , after the credits finish rolling , the other shoe will eventually have to drop . i agree with others that kim basinger 's breathy whispery performances is simply annoying that she is woefully miscast in this role . why she got an oscar for this is almost as big a mystery as any portayed in this film . however , it is not a glaring flaw and is obscured by the stellar performances of the rest of the cast . top notch from start to finish !
1	`` cry baby '' is the coolest movie since grease that deals with this time period . the songs are good and the actors in the film are really excellent . i 'm a fan of johnny depp , and he came through in this movie and him in a lead role set in the 50s worked ! this movie is not only a movie that takes place in the 50s , but it feels like a movie that was made in that decade as well . everything that was big in the movies during that time are seen and used in here . i really enjoyed how this film also dealt with issues people had then and the way people acted and thought . i also love the music , classic doo wop . so if you love movies like grease , then you need to see this movie . it 's not entirely a musical like grease was , but it still has a few songs in it . but to hear music from this time makes this movie even more real .
1	my wife and i just watched this disney movie with our 8 year old son . the colors are exquisite , deeply saturated , clear crisp detail , and picture quality is incredible . sound quality was substantially better than the original . all 6 channels of sound were strong without being harsh , and convey a sense of beauty . the film is all about the triumph of human spririt . i 'm sure that the girls will relate to the princess , but my son was impressed as well . thanks disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic . i will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family
0	this was on television earlier today . it 's a horribly dated film . bad pacing , bad music , with not much of a plot . also , i 'd suggest not eating at dante 's . and please , try not to kill the messengers
0	this a dreadful example of what jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers . the only reason to watch it would be because mamie van doren was also in it.but be aware ( and i read that in a biography about jayne ) that in their contracts was specified that they would not appear together in any scene whatsoever.so you see them separately in different scenes.also be aware that if you blink , you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties . conclusion : get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''ol ' south ' , or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl
1	dr smith and the robot go hog wild , switching personalities and swapping insults . this is a great episode
1	after an elaborate theft scheme at the cannes film festival goes terribly wrong rebecca romijn ex-stamos must go into hiding.she assumes a new identity but 7 years later a photographer threatens to expose her unless she can outwit him.full of twists , deceit and secrets where nothing is as it seems do n't expect a plot or memorable performances.rebecca is incredibly sexy but along with the rest of the cast she 's just a pawn in depalma 's clever mindbender.a huge hitchcock fan depalma is best at stylish suspense scenes with no dialogue ( like the 15 minute opening scene at the cannes film festival in this film ) and nicely includes elements of his and hitchcock 's previous films from vertigo to dressed to kill.it 's a lot of fun spotting the cinematic references and on repeated viewings you 'll notice plenty of sneaky touches.if you 're looking for an actionpacked straightforward suspense film you wo n't like femme fatale.if however you 're looking for a twisty challenging film femme fatale will reward your attention
1	this is the type of story that scares me : where seemingly innocuous decisions propel characters toward a devastating fate . the characters , portrayed by claire danes and kate beckinsale , are going to be friends for life even if they slowly , eventually drift apart . for a final trip together they decide not to go the safe , routine route of going to hawaii , again , and want something different , perhaps a little adventurous , so they decide on thailand . while there they meet a charismatic , only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him ; and the jealousy starts to seep in . in the midst of this subtle , female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail . one poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain . it 's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore . there are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation . claire danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario , whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time . she is truly a talent . kate beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-american daddy 's girl caught up in the chaos . for that matter , when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent . bill pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken , kind-hearted turn as their lawyer . there are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors . this is a movie worth watching over and again , and it is easy to recommend
0	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon.com never sent it too me . this has happened about 4/5 times . while usually i have no problem getting movies , sometimes i do . sending them e-mails does n't seem to work . if they did n't have the best prices for movies , i 'd leave
0	my second review , as my first did not get printed ( as usual ) . anyway , i 'll try to make this short and sweet . i usually try and give credits to directors , producers , writers , and actors in most of my movie reviews ; however , i 'm going to make an exception here . i 've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd `` hilarious '' , `` night of the living dead + money + color '' , `` wonderful for gorehounds '' , etc. , etc. , etc . all i can say is it must not take much to please you people . this is , without a doubt , the worst excuse for a movie i 've ever seen . ( my most humble apologies to tobe hooper and `` mortuary '' ) . the whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning , `` why do n't critics take horror movies more seriously ? '' . well , einstein , here 's a glowing example . this is nothing but grade d trash : horrible effects , horrible acting , horrible writing , horrible directing . you name it ; it 's not in there . this movie 's most feeble attempts at humor come off as just that : feeble . i bought this , together with `` dead and breakfast '' , and i ca n't begin to tell you which one is worse . so , here 's a little advice from me : go check out a book at the library , buy a book , go to a real movie , have your hair done , have a manicure -- do anything but waste your time on this gag-fest ( for all the wrong reasons ) of a movie . another one that i would give zero stars to , if i could .
1	a fantasy , dealing with the curse of star-crossed lovers , ladyhawke never fail to be top-notch entertainment . the cast is exceptional , and get their characters right . it 's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what 's going on . along with `` dragonslayer '' , this is one of the top fantasy movies . the story is compelling , the setting has a very gritty , dirty feel to it , and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages . this is not a movie i can just put on 'in the background ' and let play while doing other things , because it suck me in every time
1	this study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary . long a student of modern art , i learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before . furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself , and enormously important to the on-going study of women artists . this is a work all admirers of modern art should view
1	this three-part television production by the bbc , released in 1999 , is one of the finest films you 'll see in a while . the acting is brilliant , especially the performance by lindsay duncan , the direction is extraordinary , and the plot is most unusual ( if improbable ) . the production is flawed only by a weak musical score . the real question is : how did this superb film ever get made , in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos ? do n't miss it
0	not that i know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but a shock to the system made it look too easy . performances by michael caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and will patton as the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on television . but a shock to the system needed to close a few holes in its story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment
1	this is a movie i have been looking for for a long time this is an excellent movie from elvis i am really satisfied i recommend this movie to all elvis fans .
1	this is a great movie ! wasabi is about a police detective ( played by reno ) who has to travel to tokyo in order to sort out his past when he learns that the only woman he has ever loved has died . if you are a big fan of jean reno you will really enjoy this movie . it has a great combination of action and humor and is a good addition to a movie collection . i highly recommend this film if you are looking for a mixture of action and fun , especially if you are a fan of anything by jean reno
1	since the storylines of this fourteen-year-old film must surely be well-known , let me say that the piano , one of my favorite movies , is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid-nineteenth-century . it strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of new zealand , and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set . the quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by holly hunter , sam neill , harvey keitel , and most especially anna paquin , whose skillful portrayal here won her an oscar at the tender age of eleven . the plot of the piano is highly unusual , even unique . for filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800 's , who went from scotland to the most remote of british colonies in order to marry a stranger , for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano ... i 'm daunted by the courage of those who brought the piano into reality . for the wealth of feeling in its story , for its setting , for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability , it is a fine motion picture
1	this film 's predecessor , '' ginger snaps 2 -- unleashed , '' was a competent but uninspired effort : a typical sequel . in contrast , `` ginger snaps back '' is a significant film -- but hardly a sequel at all . the first two `` ginger snaps '' installments took place in contemporary canada , mainly in suburbs and city ; but `` ginger snaps back '' is set in the canadian frontier wilderness of nearly 200 years ago . furthermore , in the earlier films ( particularly the first ) the two sisters brigitte and ginger share a complex relationship -- loving but mutually antagonistic : ginger 's cynical death wish keeps her at odds with brigitte who would stay alive ( and human ! ) at any cost . in `` ginger snaps back , '' however , the girls have been simplified : they 've become fairy tale orphans wandering through a monster-infested forest . early on in the film , the sisters find shelter in a militaristic fort/outpost run by some very hard guys -- misfit toughs who resemble ogres just waiting for victims to approach their lonely castle ! significantly , it 's in this dubious refuge that ginger is infected with lycanthropy . thus with monsters lurking outside the gates as well as within , the film plunges toward a fiery but despairing climax . overall , `` ginger snaps back '' conveys a thrilling atmosphere of folklore and legends -- an ancient eeriness more easily felt than described . even the film 's snow-covered forests radiate a sense of centuries-old indian myths ; appropriately , the film 's indian characters , including a larger-than-life hunter/warrior , identify the werewolves with the wendigo . as a work of folklore or fairy tale , `` ginger snaps back '' tends to be less verbal , but more visionary than the preceding films in this trilogy . startling , beautiful images abound in this movie . just one example : lovely ginger in her black hooded cloak , with vamp fangs and raptor claws , flinging open the gates of the fort to admit the besieging werewolves . as the creatures surge forward and around her , ginger stands as an icon of demonic ecstasy -- comparable to the robot doppelganger in fritz lang 's great `` metropolis '' ! of course , that comparison alone should indicate the imaginative power flowing through `` ginger snaps back .
0	almost unbelievably bad , except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning . this is like a comic book for filmgoers . no , not a graphic novel adapted to the screen . more like a comic book for kids , that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age . doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack , a travesty to the nth degree .
0	not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie
0	unfortunately , i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which , of course , does n't function on a european system , despite my adress beeing in switzerland . so i was kind of disapointed to have a ) lost the money b ) not been able to watch the movie . one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player .
1	sophia loren is without arugment the most beautiful and sexy foreign actress in movie history . beginning in the mid-1950 's she did a string of italian films and became the first foreign-born actress to come to hollywood and make the crossover in mainstream american movies , starting with `` the pride and the passion '' in 1957 ( it was this film and `` houseboat '' that loren began her close relationship with cary grant ) and at the same time , blew fellow italian bella gina lollobridga out of the water as the best actress to come out of italy . in 1960 , loren went back to italy to film the world war ii film `` two women . '' a year and a half later , to everybody 's surprise she won the oscar for best actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the academy award . but if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy sophia loren was , it came with `` yesterday , today , and tomorrow . '' the scene in which she strips in front of marcello mastronini 's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too ( hope premiere magazine does a list like it someday ) . and that is the scene in which you say to everybody , `` this is sophia loren . '' in my opinion , loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on-screen in their lingerie . there is a shirt that says , `` italians do it better . '' could 'it ' be referring to sex ? if so , we can give thanks to sophia loren .
1	this has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and i was happy to see it available on dvd . the story , the script , the direction , and the acting are superb .
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father . a must see
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
1	i love this dvd ! i took karate for awhile and was pleased to find that the correct form is really emphasized in the kicks and strikes . kathy smith brings her enthusiasm and experience , and keith cooke and kelley roberts bring their knowledge of kickboxing in particular . it 's a great workout
0	rko filed for bankruptcy in the mid-1930 's and was on the verge of finally getting back on their feet financially by 1940 . i suspect that someone from their cost accounting group wandered into the studio commissary in 1939 and found it full of under-contract actors and production staff goofing off and eating studio food . they rounded up this group , stuffed the whole bunch onto an unused sound stage ( with a leftover southwestern set ) and got them singing and dancing to songs from a rogers and hart broadway show ( which they had an option on but had deemed unworthy of feature film treatment ) . the result was released as `` too many girls '' ( 1940 ) , financially practical because with almost everything already paid for ( insert fixed cost here ) , the additional expense of actually producing something boiled down to a little electricity and some black and white film stock . no good reason to track this one down , it 's pretty witless as a comedy-with the miscasting making for funnier moments than anything else in the film . everyone except ann miller is too old to be playing college students and they try to pass hal le roy ( one of hollywood 's most effeminate actors ) off as a college football all-american . i generally like this kind of stuff and will sit through anything to watch ann miller ; so if it totally turned me off it is unlikely to appeal to most viewers . mostly it is notable for what happened off camera as lucy and desi made their first connection . some of the musical numbers by rodgers and hart were bearable ; `` heroes in the fall '' and `` pottawatomie '' . trudy erwin dubs lucy 's only song . francis langford does most of the other numbers . mildly wild heiress connie casey ( lucille ball ) returns from finishing school in europe with an unusual request to attend her father 's alma mater in new mexico-pottawatomie college . `` you mean a lot to me , pottawatomie . you hit the spot of me , pottawatomie . i love pottawatomie with all my anatomy . so every tot of me , that is begot of me , will go to pot , pot , pottawatomie '' . lucy was almost 30 at the time and even with `` extreme '' soft focus and minimal close-ups ca n't remotely pass for 18 . her father suspects that she has a boyfriend at the school and hires four ivy league football stars to monitor the behavior of the new freshman . the four eventually end up playing for the school 's hapless football team , which in a matter of a few days has changed its schedule to include games with big time programs like nebraska , columbia and tennessee . there is a grand celebration at which the student body sings the following less-than-immortal lyrics : `` you 're a ham-better scram-notre dame , we 'll make williams wail , army-you too navy , boo hoo to purdue , georgia tech day you 'll dread-you 're a wreck , look at brown turn blue , we 'll make a bumpia out of columbia , in a quota minnesota 's got to go , you 'll see u of d , we 'll have all the alphabet to shout out . '' ( reviewers note : the u of d is the university of detroit which was once a football power ) . the scale of this thing is ultimately its undoing as broadway ensembles of 15 are replaced with a cast of hundreds ( remember all those people sitting in the rko commissary drawing paychecks for doing nothing ) . on risquï¿½ broadway the girls who are still virgins wear beanies ; in the film they wear them to signify that they have never been kissed ( it is amusing to watch these aging and jaded rko starlets trying to pass for ultra-chaste teens ) . there is a corny and unconvincing romance between lucy and richard carlson ; whose brand of wooden acting would eventually work to his advantage in 1950 's science fiction films like `` it came from outer space '' . then again , what do i know ? i 'm only a child
1	ohhhhhhhhhh my my my , what can i say about this one ? by the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987 , i was not familiar with freddy at all except for the fact that i knew the premise ... .he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens . the fact that i was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help . i was terrified of anything related to horror . in my mind freddy was the worst . as a scared 15 year old kid , freddy was the last thing i wanted to view . i was watching films like , raiders of the lost ark and the empire strikes back . those i could handle . however , in late summer of 1987 , a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch . i asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me . all he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it . so , i went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box . he just slid it into the slot of the vcr . folks , i saw the new line cinema logo and then this graphic , `` sleep , those little slices of death . how i loathe them ... .edgar allan poe '' my mind started to reel but i had not yet realized what this film was ; and then i saw the title , `` a nightmare on elm street 3 : dream warriors . '' now mind you the closest i ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool dokken video on mtv called , dream warriors . i even had a hard time viewing the visage of freddy in that mtv video . hilarious huh ? ? anyway , when i saw the title come up , i grabbed my coat and i was getting the hell out of there and quickly . however , my buddy begged me to give it a chance , he said its not as bad as i was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny . now i thought he was pullin my leg with that statement . even his mother told me id like it . she had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy . so , once i heard her reassure me as well , i decided to give it a chance . as the opening of the film carried on i viewed the front cover on the box . a vicious looking cover with freddy 's face leering over several teens facing him , appearing to stand on his out-stretched knives with a tagline that i find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever ! ! ! `` if you think you 'll get out alive , you must be dreaming . '' anyhow , suffice it to say , after experiencing dream warriors , i was instantly relieved and i was also an instant fan ! ! i couldnt believe it actually because id sworn this character off . i was terrified of him . i suppose id have to thank my buddy mike c. for that . thank you mike for opening the door to this series for me . ive loved it ever since . ive seen all of them . many argue and argue over which film is the best , but dream warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first nightmare and the first time i had to get ready for freddy ! ! : ) hope you enjoyed my review . by the way , i did laugh during my first viewing , and i also feel that poster art was the best of all of them
1	this is the first workout i attempted after the birth of my daughter . the first few times were a major challenge , but i have been doing it 3 times per week for 3 months now and , not only have i actually stuck with it , but i have my pre-pregnancy body back ! i really do n't feel i can say enough good things about this video . my boyfriend and i do this video together and we have both been very impressed . and the best part - as i get better i can focus more acutely on the relevant muscle group and maintain the difficulty of the workout . i highly recommend this video for all levels
0	b grade movie , really poor script . bulk of movie is boring , superficial , stereotypical . real purpose of movie is baptist condemnation of the supernatural . story line . the wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit . the husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife . on the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life . overtones . the leading man is depicted as unstable , self-centered , reckless , irresponsible , and fantasy-prone.before and during the two year period . when revealed to the those assembled , the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned . his `` giving up the ghost '' is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life . the daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head-on crash with a car.leaving her frightened and distraught . media messages . the film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo . 1 . spirit contact is dangerous , selfish , and emotionally unhealthy . 2 . the personal grieving journey of another should be co-opted by peers . 3 . condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact . there should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like `` what did she look like ? '' `` what kinds of things did she say ? '' 4 . messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted . in short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones.. in life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us . in passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond . when william blake 's brother passed , he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all . many near-death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves . the inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds . the same is true for after-death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
1	bo derek plays the title role to perfection in this blake edwards comedy . despite what the amazon capsule says , julie andrews plays dudley moore 's girlfriend and not his wife . watch the film before you write a summary of it ! along with the pink panther films , this stands as one of edwards best films . it is a high point in the career of dudley moore and he is just perfect as george . robert webber also is good as george 's gay cowriter and friend . andrews is fine , also but what you leave the theatre with is the images of bo derek . someone knew how to cast the title character perfectly
1	john wayne stars as sgt . striker . striker is a marine who is given a group of misfits to turn into men . striker is also dealing with problems at home . his wife hates the military and has left him taking their son away . wayne is obviously concerned about what will happen to his son in the clutches of someone who may teach him none of the values of being an american . making it worse , one of wayne 's men is the son of a famous soldier but has been so brainwashed that he hates america , everything it stands for and the military . its obvious that this guy represents what wayne fears his son will be turned into by his wife : an anti-american/anti-military peacenik liberal weakling . wayne is the pure image of the american fighting leader . he is a machine that crushes everyone in his path . he knocks one old troublemaker soldier around as an example and that brings the men into line . by the time they get to iwo , striker has built them into a fighting unit . no personalities , no thoughts except for battle , no fear . they have been perfectly prepared for the battle . and having accomplished his task , striker is killed during the battle . his death teaches us as americans a final and most important lesson . none of the men are important in their lives or what they do . leaders are not important either . whats important is that the corps as a big machine keeps going . striker builds the new leaders in battle and then the torch is passed to them to go on and do the same thing . war builds character and burns away the phony idealogy of liberalism and peace . great men like sgt . striker are not created in classrooms , they can only be created in war .
1	this film is treated something like the lost child in the canon of director woody allen 's career . as if he would have to apologize for this instead of , say , `` the curse of the jade scorpion '' . what allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking . this is the first example i can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style , later employed by albert brooks and perfected by christopher guest . allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well . the conceit of the film is a gas . we 're supposed to believe that allen 's virgil starkwell , an inept dweeb of a criminal , if not among the fbi 's most wanted does cause mr. hoover some sleepless nights . the gags here are rapidfire but i would n't spoil it for those who are uninitiated . my favorite being , though , is virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he 's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm . all this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather . also , noteworthy in the cast is the late janet margolin as virgil 's faithful wife . margolin basically plays straight woman to allen but it 's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in `` david and lisa '' did n't have a more substantial film career
0	this item is supposedly titled `` ufos : the first encounters . '' it is , however , an episode about reincarnation . it is incorrectly labeled . do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
1	this movie has a very high `` cheese '' factor . the most glaring example being when the notre dame player scores a touchdown in the 1928 army game after rock 's rousing `` win one for the gipper '' speech , looks to the sky and says `` that 's one for the gipper ! '' that aside , this is a great movie ! it is way better than `` rudy '' ! ! ! after all , rudy 's notre dame playing career lasted less than even 30 seconds ! ! ! this is the story of the story of the one man who actually built the program for crying out loud ! ! ! ! if it was n't for rock , rudy would have never happened ! i 'll take this story over the one about a hapless janitor any day ! ! !
1	i never really knew of matthew modine until i saw this movie . he was very good in the part and i have watched the movie several times . i also purchased the book as well .
1	even though gordon lui is the main reason you 're buying this film , the story is n't bad either . excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences . my only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes . but that scene is not enough to tarnish this film . this is a solid film
1	jack london needs to be given his proper due . he is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes . although the call of the wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog 's story , it contains as much truth and reality of man 's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life 's work of many other respected authors . jack london 's writing is beautiful , poignant , and powerful , yet also somber , morose , and infinitely real . london does n't paint pretty picture , nor is the story elevating or uplifting . as an animal lover , i found parts of this story heartbreaking from buck 's removal from the civilized southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard , weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes . even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled 's traces around him . good-spirited curly never had a chance , while dave 's story is only made bearable because of his brave , undying spirit . even spitz , the harsh taskmaster , has to be pitied , despite his harsh nature , for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches . buck 's travails are long and hard , but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero , despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him . buck not only conquers the weather , the harshness of the men , the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with , he thrives . hopes for redemption with john thornton are dashed in the end , and that 's when buck finally gives in fully to `` the call of the wild , '' becoming a creature of nature only . while this is a sad ending , the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at buck 's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed
0	as the reviews below indicate , `` arthur '' has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful `` screwball comedy '' ( although over time , times readers , perhaps more discerning than vincent , have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars ) and bravo listed it # 10 on its list of best comedies ( see below ) . i first saw dudley moore in `` foul play , '' thought he was very funny . based upon that , i bought `` 10 '' and `` arthur , '' as it turned out a downward trajectory . what i dislike about `` arthur '' is moore playing a loud , obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes , and minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves arthur for himself , not for his $ 750 million fortune . even john gielgud , who was great in `` the loved one '' a much better comedy , ca n't resurrect this turkey . okay , folks . start casting your negative votes . in the meantime , here 's the bravo 100 best comedies list : 100 . anchorman 99 . the birdcage 98 . school of rock 97 . happy gilmore 96 . four weddings and a funeral 95 . harold kumar go to white castle 94 . waiting for guffman 93 . the aristocrats 92 . father of the bride 91 . revenge of the nerds 90 . clueless 89 . slapshot 88 . team america 87 . the kentucky fried movie 86 . zoolander 85 . dirty rotten scoundrels 84 . silver streak 83 . sister act 82 . tootsie 81 . half baked 80 . lost in america 79 . three amigos 78 . bananas 77 . flirting with disaster 76 . ghostbusters 75 . dumb and dumber 74 . trading places 73 . city slickers 72 . moonstruck 71 . roxanne 70 . the nutty professor ( eddie murphy ) 69 . the blues brothers 68 . broadcast news 67 . kingpin 66 . dazed and confused 65 . office space 64 . this is spinal tap 63 . manhattan 62 . the pink panther 61 . election 60 . when harry met sally 59 . police academy series 58 . private benjamin 57 . swingers 56 . young frankenstein 55 . bull durham 54 . ferris bueller 's day off 53 . dr. strangelove 52 . meet the parents 51 . national lampoon 's vacation 50 . the princess bride 49 . american pie 48 . american graffiti 47 . 9 to 5 46 . the incredibles 45 . raising arizona 44 . sixteen candles 43 . what about bob ? 42 . harold and maude 41 . austin powers 40 . monty python and the holy grail 39 . mrs. doubtfire 38 . best in show 37 . dodgeball 36 . good morning vietnam 35 . beetlejuice 34 . rushmore 33 . clerks 32 . groundhog day 31 . the big lebowski 30 . the 40 year old virgin 29 . legally blonde 28 . annie hall 27 . a fish called wanda 26 . wayne 's world 25 . meet the fockers 24 . bill ted 's excellent adventure 23 . big 22 . beverly hills cop 21 . shampoo 20 . the jerk 19 . wedding crashers 18 . stripes 17 . m*a*s*h 16 . old school 15 . fast times at ridgemont high 14 . napoleon dynamite 13 . naked gun series 12 . the producers 11 . pee-wee 's big adventure 10 . arthur 9 . ace ventura : pet detective 8 . blazing saddles 7 . the wedding singer 6 . airplane 5 . south park : bigger , longer , uncut 4 . there 's something about mary 3 . shrek 2 . caddyshack 1 . animal house my suggested additions : `` the loved one , '' `` leap of faith , '' `` used cars , '' `` eulogy '' and `` drop dead , gorgeous .

0	this movie is laughable today . it 's very dated , and it shows . it 's not worth your time . the acting is so-so , but felt forced ( like william shatner style ) . the storyline is okay . by today 's standards , it appears like a low budget flick
1	why the record company would put this out on vhs , and not dvd , is beyond me , especially considering its release date . the ultimate would be ( and they have done it before , see both the doors and sepultura dvd releases ) to take this , and add to it , live at brixton , and put it all on one dvd . since this does n't seem likely , i suggest , burn your own dvd , and include not only `` ricochet '' and `` another bloody murder '' ( both left out ) , but also mr. bungle 's one music video release . happily , while `` stripsearch '' is not listed on the back of the vhs box , it is included . fnm videos ? great , great , great..
1	this is a great picture that i think grant morrison was imitating in his first issue of `` the invisibles '' . it has cinematography and acting that repressed hollywood would n't get away from for another few years . great ending that completely caught me off guard . a very complete film
0	i love norm macdonald and this is the dumbest movie of all tim
1	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd , because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert . granted , they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim . this is truly a broadway event . the documentary , which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun , but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin . we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety
1	but it 's the core 25 % , and if you look at this as its own piece , then you 'll be satisfied . the visuals are great , gary cooper is great , and ayn rand 's premise is all here . and for those of you picking apart rand 's philosophy and its role in architecture : yes , the movie is an exaggeration . the book is too . that 's the point .
1	this was a great movie . while not my favorite john wayne movie , it is still a good one ! i always laugh at the scenes where his character is getting jealous about his friend being with angel . nobody does it like john wayne . love the song too !
1	this is one of my all time favorite films . fosse only made 5 feature films in his career ( sweet charity , cabaret , lenny , this one , and star 80 ) , but everyone is a masterpiece . this is his best film . it 's an autobiographical film about a filmmaker/choreographer who 's addicted to work , booze , pills , sex , work , booze , more pills , etc. , etc.. it 's definitely based of fosse himself , and it 's a rather painful portrait . fosse should be commended for admitting ( for lack of a better term ) that 's he 's not a great person . there 's no `` closure '' scenes here , where joe gideon ( wonderfully played by roy scheider , fosse 's alter ego ) realises the error of his ways , and makes peace with everyone . fosse shows warts and more warts , but in spite of that , the film is amazing . brilliantly edited , shot , acted , and choreographed , this is fosse 's best film , one that really defined him as an artist . fosse was not a prolific filmmaker , but when he did make a film , it was a masterpiece . and this is his greatest one ...
0	`` over done '' is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a `` stolen '' video camera .
0	unless you enjoy movies that are not funny , not scary , and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns , do not watch this series of horrible flicks . putrid ! not even `` so-bad-it's-funny '' . absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
0	dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed . the only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller . other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the alan smithee psuedonym - what a pity mr. king did n't . just awful
1	a schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world . michael , a young writer , comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet . eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity , sex , bigotry , and ultimately a true grim view of society . as dark as it sounds i found parts of this movie very amusing . housewives , pass on this one it 's not 'finding nemo ' . if you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor/satire i 'd reccomend you watch this ... .a true must see for the inebriated
0	will not play once video was downloaded . i get the error message : `` can not play file , please try again later . error # 0x80040273 '' i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed , i was told the unbox saturday and sunday 6-5 hours . i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature . i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem . thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again - feb. 10,200
1	billy elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class ( meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike ) . this is the classic `` family does n't initially understand , '' `` teacher believes in him , '' `` screws up audition but spirit carries him through '' type movie . it 's put together quite nicely , and you never really know how it is going to turn out . the transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day , which seemed jarring . the beginning of swan lake , with billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance , 10 years or so later , was a real `` feel good '' part of the movie
0	purely for fans of crappy van damme movies again like i says . really corny from beginning to end . paul sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one . rob schnider is wasted and why the hell was he in this i will have no clue . van damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in double team . with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said hey ! ! ! ! damnit , lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here
0	harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals , and her bright friend 's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb ( incendiary ) during a school assembly . either one will get a kid expelled , arrested , and in the newspapers . not amusing ! then there 's golly telling her about the virtues of lying . if there is a lesson that could be drawn ( which the movie misses ) , harriet 's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing , because she is showing the sort of behavior that ( in a kid 2 years older ) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia , as in the movie `` thirteen .
1	after slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most can not see that we twenty-first century americans were not the intended audience for this movie . the movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the national socialist party in germany , which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made . from its loss of world war i until the nsdap was elected to power in germany in 1934 , the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare , illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of germany at the hands of the french , and an economic catastrophe that made our american depression look like a picnic by comparison . this movie sought to persuade germans ( germans ! ) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal bolshevik traitors responsible for germany 's defeat in world war i , and all the residual woes , would be defeated once and for all . it must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly do n't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of germans who attended the nsdap rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out . if you speak and understand german , you 'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies , and this film that celebrates them . for many who are not conversant in the german language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in american world war ii films , the film is actually pretty boring after a while . you sit there and watch one group of soldiers , police , or workers after another , marching and marching and marching . this is interspersed with speeches by hitler and the other party officals . from time to time you 'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things , some in costume , but mostly they 're just talking , walking , eating , brushing their teeth , and so on . be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring , gigantic ss parade with weapons bristling , be prepared to be disappointed . the last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the ss leibstandarte adolph hitler , and they 're marching to what was reputedly hitler 's favorite piece -- `` der badenweiler '' . remember to notice that they are n't even carrying rifles or bayonets ... . lastly , in my opinon , the commentary by `` historian '' dr anthony santoro is mostly just another sarcastic , demeaning rant against the people in the film , so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war . the marching soliders and other germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor , beleagured country are all long dead , but santoro must make fun of them for the amusement ( ? ) of the american audience . try to remember -- this movie was not made for you !
1	this is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of african americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of l.a. as you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends . you truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born . ice cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal , from fights on the corner , to drive by shootings . this movie truly captures the struggle millions of african americans go through . as we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto , to when they are old enough to get out , they still seem to be the same . their customs dont change , simply because of their surrounding , guns , liquor , poverty , and crime . they have no other option than do join in . when dough boy 's ( ice cube ) brother ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto . the whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also , so everyone is supporting him . until a tragedy is brought upon the family . this story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys .
1	juliette binoche is an amazing actress . since her best supporting actress oscar for `` the english patient '' in 1996 and her nomination for `` chocolat , '' she 's an actress whose films i seek . `` the widow of saint-pierre '' has a bit of irony to the title . the opening frames show binoche in black staring out of a window . we then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward . we learn that the `` widow '' is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from france before the big execution can take place . we see director emir kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner neel whose rehabilitation binoche 's madame la seeks . we keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner . daniel autereil who won a cesar ( french oscar ) for his work with director patrice leconte for `` ridicule '' in 1996 plays the lovestruck captain who is in charge of the execution . spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife , he thwarts the town 's sentence of death at every turn , refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore . in the moment of ultimate irony , neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore , which is sure to result in his own execution . the bloody resolution and the final shots of binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion . patrice leconte has a great reserve , shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic . this is an incredibly tragic romance , one that works exquisitely . enjoy !
1	talk to her is an unforgettable masterpiece about two female coma-patients and the men who nurse them . provocative and colorful , almodovar 's film keeps the audience on the jump with stupefying plot-turns and as usual he makes short work of small-minded moral ideas . his piety is seasoned with humor , the entire film a tightrope-act on the border of good taste - but afterwards you will say to yourself : thank god that i have seen it ! one of the patients is lydia , a proud lady-matador and a diva after almodovar 's heart . she spends her life reckless on the passing-lane and celebrates her own image . but life outside the arena exceeds her orbit and her prominent lover drops her . talk-show host marco takes her by storm when he kills a snake in her kitchen ( `` i respect other people 's phobias '' ) . their passionate affair develops into an armament-race and soon the day comes when lydia faces the bull that is her match . the fight was unfair from the start : the poor creature was stabbed in the neck before being chased out of its box . marco feels guilty and flamenco-singers set up a wail . her brain is dead , she has no thoughts , no feelings and the doctors tell marco that , while there is no hope , miracles happen . lydia 's fellow-sufferer in the coma-ward is alicia , a pretty young ballerina , four years ago the victim of a car accident . her boyfriend benigno looks after her since then . he sponges her down , dresses her , gives her eye-drops . he is her masseur , her physiotherapist and female viewers will resent this violation of their privacy . he cuts her hair so that she will feel no difference when she wakes up . and he speaks to her , mostly about ballet . he believes in miracles and treats alicia as if she were alive , while marco treats lydia as if she were dead . he is afraid to touch her and takes his notebook to her room ... benigno is the film 's secret star and one of almodovar 's most endearing heroes . he spent years of his life as subjugated nurse of an exploitive mother and is very much in touch with his feminine side . others take an interest in his sexual orientation ; he thinks it 's beside the point . irrelevant . and he displays unselfish devotion for the woman he loves . when alicia 's father - a psychiatrist - is concerned about benigno 's virginity he has the presence of mind to pretend that he prefers men . the good doctor - who considers virginity as perversion ( ! ) - is reassured and entrusts him with his daughter 's care . and when marco inquires : `` what do you know about women ? '' benigno replies : `` everything . i spent twenty years of my life with one , four years with another '' . benigno was actually not alicia 's boyfriend , just her secret admirer , but he confesses : `` the last four years have been the best of my life . i do everything that amuses her , except travel '' . benigno 's unshakable optimism irritates the others . alicia 's father restrains himself when he sees the boy 's hand on his daughter 's thigh , and marco does not understand why benigno considers his relationship with a brain-dead woman as mutual . but he sneaks into alicia 's room and wonders what she has that lydia does n't have ... marco gives up when he learns that lydia deceived him with her ex who asserts his claim : `` i want to spend more time with her '' . marco replies : '' feel at home '' and benigno asks : `` did you separate ? '' . silent films were alicia 's other passion beside ballet and benigno feels so much empathy that he dreams in black and white . the dream sequence is the film 's most memorable scene and a cross between `` the incredible shrinking man '' , gustave courbet 's painting : `` the origin of the world '' and alfred kubin 's drawing : `` death leap '' . an egoist shrinks , explores his girlfriend 's body and returns to the place her came from ... the film takes a highly sensitive turn when benigno voices his intention to marry alicia . marco is shocked : `` you can also talk to plants , but you do n't marry them ! '' . benigno is placed in a bad light when the doctors find out that alicia is pregnant ... the film 's exquisite monstrosity lies not in benigno 's act but in almodovar 's conclusion : coldness kills women , true love brings them back to life . benigno 's `` act of love '' lies somewhere between rape and necrophilia , and yet almodovar does get away with it . perhaps because he is willing to sacrifice his star , perhaps because he is so ingratiating . women are convinced that he understands them , men are tempted into testing the unknown . he gives the audience suspense and the critics art . he is the favorite..
1	this is a must for purchasing dvds ! this is one movie that should be on dvd and still in the market ! this special edition different from the original dvd release . the original dvd release as just the movie . this special edition featured full length intewrviews with the cast from 2005 . they were also pictures of the cast , including the witch women . they were n't ugly , they were gorgous . i do n't know why the director wanted to place those ugly masks over thier beauty , i mean not all witches are ugly !
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	terrific movie . matthew broderick makes you believe that he is a high school social studies teacher with every step he takes and every rhythm of his speech ( `` good luck , there , tracy '' ) . reese witherspoon ca n't be accused of underacting her part , but that 's the fun of it . she is hilarious as the high school overachiever who does n't care who she steps over ( or on ) to succeed . filmed on the site of a real omaha high school , many of the other members of the cast are taken from local talent . all the extras are actual students , and one of the leads ( chris klein of `` american pie '' who plays tracy 's archrival paul ) was just the kid who had nailed the part of tony in the school 's recent production of `` west side story . '' this was his break-out movie . even the custodian was played by the real custodian . all that gives the film a kind of realism that 's rare . it accordingly uses ordinary sounds and spaces brilliantly , from the rotating sprinkler that begins the film , to the noises of kids talking outside class , to the grind of the garbage truck in the early morning hours when mr. m snoozes outside linda novotny 's house waiting for her ( never ) to return home . and on the subject of garbage , watch for the number of times this becomes a motif in the film , leading up to the culminating event ( which i wo n't spoil ) . even the denouement has a rehabilitated mr. m , turned museum docent , throwing trash at the rear window of a limo . this is not only a very funny movie ; it 's also an intelligent and careful one . a lot of sex too , but none of it glamorous
1	spalding gray is stream of consiousness on speed . over before you know it , you 'll know a lot more when it 's over
1	thoroughly enjoyed this product , have already watched it numerous times . highly recommend this to any chick fan
1	we start off with ace fighter pilot topper harley ( charlie sheen ) who originally got kicked out of the navy but is returning to help them save a mission , code name `` sleepy weasel '' . harley has his own problems like overcoming the death of his father and getting along with a snobby brown noser kent gregory ( cary elwes ) . adding to the confusion is ramada thompson ( valeria golino ) , a beautiful shrink , who is kent 's girlfriend and topper 's love interest . they go head to head when ramada topper 's affection becomes obvious at the bar , and kent declares war on topper . among the other pilots is pete `` dead meat '' thompson ( william o'leary ) , jim `` washout '' pfaffenbach , kowalski ( kristy swanson ) , lt.comm james block ( kevin dunn ) , and admiral `` tug '' benson ( lloyd bridges ) . topper kent is definatley not the only story going on here . there is the death of `` dead meat '' , `` washout '' struggling with wall-eye vision , a deceitful commander trying to abort the mission , and an incompetent admiral that does n't know which you shoot : fish or duck . but c'mon , you did n't really watch this movie to make sense out of it did you ? you watched it for the same reason you watch any of jim abrahams movies-you want a good laugh ! ! and i guarantee you , you wo n't be disappointed ! do n't try to analyze it . just have a good time ! ! !
0	quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book . hopefully they will remake the movie soon , because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice
0	i do n't write many reviews , but this movie was just so pitifully lame that i felt it was my public duty to warn you about it . the fact that amazon tries to bundle it with `` house of 1,000 corpses '' must be some kind of joke ! the dialogue and acting do n't even rise to the standards of a made-for-tv movie . the cops do n't look , talk , or act like cops , and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality ( his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation ) . also , though they try to sell this as a horror film , it is n't . this film does n't even try to be scary . the first half is a boring , brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious buffalo bill-esque sociopath ( dee snider ) . in the second half , our psycho gets released from prison , apparently reformed , but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good . what really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho is n't even a killer . he captures his victims and tortures them for a while . and the torture is nothing terribly gruesome , either . his idea of torture apparently does n't go much further than sewing his victims ' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings . then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital . the only victim he actually kills dies accidentally . this dung heap of a movie is just not scary , and not worth your time
0	this is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic . i had n't read the book before seeing the movie . the film stunk . a few years later , i read the book and was enchanted . i did not make the connection that this was the same story until i saw the film again on late night tv . i was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen . then , i realized what movie it was . i tried to sit through it . i just could n't . the monster should have eaten the film
1	i enjoyed the film , it was uncanny , bizarre , and colorful . wow . it ' was a nice family movie
1	ah yes ... tarantino 's first script entitled true romance which he sold for 30,000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing , you will notice in subsequent films and scripts , is common for him . certain terms will show up later on in other movies . and as for reservoir dogs , his second greatest film ever , he used the money from true romance 's script to make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films including one or two from true romance
0	it really sucks , tried to download but it 's not able to be viewed in pc 's outsided the united states . crikey . i 'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly . whatta shame amazon dot com . let 's send a csi to yer headquarters
0	off-hand , i ca n't think of a worse movie . ( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films -- hey , he 's making a buck , here . ) that 's all . 1/32 star , if possible
1	this is a good old fashioned film similar to the english film 'goodbye mr chips ' . it has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour , pathos , passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings ! ! ! i defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited marr baby dies shortly after birth , or when james 'red ' sandstrom jr. comes to vist marty at christmas with his mother . i just love the whole tone of the film - the director has got the atmosphere just right . a real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness i am pleased to say . it is a film i can watch again and again . even my husband , normally quite reticent with such films , was impressed . that to me was praise indeed
1	there are few great movies that will make shed a tear , but this one is really great . daughters do n't know how much their mothers will go for them . they just understand their mothers when they get to be one . this movie , the place , the weather , the circumstances , is so depressive but beautiful . dolores started to work hard out of love for her child , after that she worked because of gratitude . what a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end . at the beginning i was weary about this movie because is based on stephen king 's work , but this movie really proved me wrong .
1	if someone asked me to choose one episode of `` maverick '' that superbly illustrates my favorite television series ' strengths , this might be it . james garner 's fascinatingly complex character bret maverick is on full display and diane brewster as samantha crawford , maverick 's primary female nemesis , is introduced in this episode in all her slipperiness and duplicity in a plot that revolves around a new orleans riverboat gambling contest that hinges on an obscure poker rule of the day . the principals later segue by stagecoach to a western town with a crooked casino , where they encounter leo gordon as mike mccomb , maverick 's strapping irish ally . jodie foster 's character in the recent mel gibson movie version was based on samantha , and ms. brewster 's performance is a revelation , forcing the viewer to bemoan the policy of that period preventing most television actors from moving into theatricals . warners ' unsung but mesmerizing stable of character actors are peppered throughout the show to good effect , as is always the case with this series , and this episode has a classic feel , with lustrous lighting and photography and fascinatingly nuanced performances . this is one to watch repeatedly and serves as a superior companion to the movie version
1	with a well crafted script , good actors at the heights of their powers and brisk no nonsense direction . emma thompson has done better work since but kenneth branagh has n't unfortunately . too bad really . branagh may still be a pretty good director but i think working with emma is what lent him an appeal and warmth on screen that he has not been able to recapture . his hamlet was glossy , chilly , unpleasant and too old . nevertheless , i 'm grateful that we at least have this , as well as his henry v and much ado about nothing
0	i 'm an animation fan , and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out . while the animation was fine ( although a tad creepy ) , i found the story off-putting . its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a.k.a substance `` d. '' i found this film depressing and annoying . i particularly found the 'blur suit ' to be distracting to watch . it almost gave me a headache . 1 star . did not like
1	i remember the first time i saw the movie on tbs in the u.s. as usual , i started watching half-way into it and i was amazed by an unknown actor/star ( van damme ) who captivated my interest with some of the most awe-inspiring martial arts moves i 'd have ever seen at the time . as a young teenager , this movie was very inspiring ( to get involved in martial arts ) . plot - b does a movie such as this need a plot to be an enjoyable movie ? simple answer is no . the plot is very basic . a soldier ( frank dux ) in the u.s. military goes a.w.o.l . to compete in a no-holds-barred tournament in asia ( think ultimate fighting championship -- asian style ) . he is competing to fulfill a promise to his old martial arts mentor . the u.s. military sends two agents after him to bring him back in one piece and to keep him from competing . along the way he makes a friend ( who is also competing in the tournament ) and a girlfriend ( who is a reporter who is covering the tournament ) . expect lots of different styles of martial arts fights with van damme 's fights being the most impressive . the side stories of the friendships and the relationships are not fleshed out very well . the movie is all about the action ! according to interviews , the original cut was unreleasable . van damme went back and re-cut the movie and even 16-18 years later , the movie holds its own in the martial arts movie genre . acting - c the acting is pretty bad from all , except for the small role of a military agent ( played by a young forrest whitaker ) . van damme is young and very goodlooking , but it does n't compensate for his trouble with the dialogue and his rather wooden presence ( even in the romantic interludes ) . he does display at times a boyish charm , but it does not occur often enough . who needs acting skills when you can dazzle with your martial art skills . music - b i found the music soundtrack ( which i actually own ) to be quite entertaining and fit perfectly in a fight-type movie . the songs were done mostly by paul hertzog and reminded me of the fight anthems of rocky iv ( by survivor ) . very original to this movie and remain among my favorite of any fight type movie . cinematography - c the movie occurs mostly indoors ( with a few shots of the asian streets ) so there is n't much to comment on . the choreography of the fights and the camera angles really make the fights appear authentic and rather gruesome . dvd - d the only extras are a trailer and some behind the scenes info you can read . typical `` movie-only '' release for this kind of film . overall - b if you are wanting to relive '80 's fight action movies or are a martial arts fan , this is the movie for you . very good movie and i consider it one of van damme 's best .
1	this movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun . it is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary . the technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer . the source is glossy and gorgeous . the director 's clout is also impressive . johnny depp gives a performance monologue as jack kerouac and john torturro gives an emotional reading from `` howl . '' dennis hopper imitates burroughs as well later in the film . their efforts are impressive . just to let the skeptics out there know , there is no room for doubt in this documentary . the beats are heroes and saviors -- and not much else is considered . that some of them were minor talents is brushed over . massive beat generation fans would give it five stars . a totally sanitized version of william s. burroughs is presented , and it is implied that kerouac was only a heterosexual , which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious . the film 's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted . one memorable quotation was , `` you can overdose on anything including sushi . '' well no , not really . it does not matter though , the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off .
0	private investigator and former police detective jack ramsey ( michael harris ) is enjoying an affair with the local district attorney 's wife , but when she is strangled not long after he has departed following a session of amorous activity , ramsey is pegged as the primary suspect due to `` clues '' obviously planted at the murder scene in order to incriminate him , and additionally because of a zealous detective ( matt mccoy ) who has personal persons for disliking the former policeman . as ramsey tries to clear his name , the sister ( carrie-anne moss ) of the deceased shows up , and soon she and jack begin their own affair that is complicated by subsequent homicides and by jack 's former police partner , performed by brion james , ostensibly , despite private devils , the sole individual ramsey can trust as additional evidence mounts against him despite entry of other suspects . harris , a charismatic player who has created excellent roles , can do but little with a script that defeats as well the rest of the cast , hindered by a wandering plot that is clichéd and predictable from the film 's opening while , despite helpful cutting , there remains an obligatory slow motion love scene , as well as embarrassing emoting from mccoy , moss and james that is made unduly prominent because of faltering direction .
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	the unbox video version of this film for tivo is useless . only after purchasing it did i discover that this film can only be downloaded to a tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period . for more than the cost of the dvd , i 'm restricted in when , where and how i can watch this movie . nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios . i will not purchase another tivo unbox film .
1	i love this movie . and i do n't have anything bad to say about it . but if you get the dvd be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match . so you hear an actor speak before their mouths move . this drove me crazy but i still enjoyed the movie
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	the hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is . clark gable , playing the suave but ethical advertising man , is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon sydney greenstreet . both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match , each making strategic moves of cunning , self-pride and power -- gable , in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him . greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product . most interesting however is the internal struggle gable , kerr , and gardner are each battling . gable , basically a good man , is somewhat of a player and finds himself in love with kerr . kerr , a widow with children , is a righteous woman deeply attracted to gable but can not reconcile with his lifestyle . gardner , a sultry singer of a sordid background , longs to settle down as a respectable housewife and mother and his her net set for gable . all three do a magnificent job of portraying the internal struggles of their characters . in the end gable buckles but does not break before the formidable greenstreet . realizing that he can not continue on working for this tyrant without compromising his standards , gable passes on the company ? s lucrative offer and walks , but not before he has publicly humiliated greenstreet . of course , gable does get the girl in the end . which one ? watch the movie and find out !
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	this movie is based on reality in which the boxer ruben carter was wrongfully accused of murder . it shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible . just because carter was black , he was imprisoned . this film is remarquable and denzel washington is absolutely fantastic as ruben carter . it shows his wrong accusation , the racism , and his descent into madness in prison . it 's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending . ruben carter is helped by a group of canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison . it 's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone . this movie is up there for me with films like the shawnshank redemption and the green mile ! highly reccomended
1	i used to love this movie as a child , now my goddaughter and i watch it together . this dvd has 3 different shows on it , all with a great moral
1	after living with this film for 15 years , it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character liz ( jane birkin ) , who in context is speaking of the work of her husband , the painter frenhofer . according to her , it concerns something `` shameful -- it 's not the body that is shameful , not the nudity , but something else . . . '' that `` something else '' is a violation , existentially speaking , of the enigma of the painter 's model . such a violation can not be seen without the mediation of art . in a cinematic context , it is the risk the direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally , and we can see rivette 's tendency to retreat to wide shots , to place events off-screen , or to circle behind his players . is this a critique of bresson , who insisted on calling his players `` models '' rather than `` actors ? '' ( it is impossible not to recall the storied psychological scars bresson 's methods allegedly left on his players. ) it is clearly not that simple , for there are close-ups in noiseuse that seem to be as cruel to the actors as frenhofer is to his model . this goes beyond bresson in other ways : rivette , always the reader , has patched together a thumping good story from literary sources ranging from poe to balzac to james , and in the process has created a true mystery thriller . that the mystery hinges on four-minute shots of a hand scratching out a drawing makes it no less thrilling . it tumbles forward toward a profoundly ironic ending worthy of the best james novels . the initial critical take on this film was that it was the most thorough document of the artistic process ever committed to film . well , yes and no . it seems to be about the artistic process of a painter , but i think there may be a playful game of `` bait-and-switch '' afoot . watch béart . watch , especially , piccoli , who is a veritable encyclopedia of the actor 's art , as mesmerizing in his scudding , absent-minded movements as he is in his sudden precision , always surprising . rivette 's devotion to actors is clear in all his films : think of his sets , so resembling stages with their creaky boards , a sound `` effect '' in rivette that more often than not takes the place of score . it may be that the artist of canvas , plaster , stone , or screen may reveal something secret , even shameful , in his models . it may even be that the unscrupulous artist is a thief of the soul . but rivette , for one , shows in la belle noiseuse that he has given these things some serious thought . and he is always generous to his actors . the result is that the trust between artist and model demonstrated in this film amounts to a strong rebuke to the idea that film can not show thought . it can ; it comes at a price , but in the hands of a master it can be as great a gift to the players as it is to the audience
1	this movie has been on my top 5 list for years . although the quality of the movie is poor by today 's standard , it is worth it to see the transformation of this young woman . do n't miss this movie
0	i wont buy this title until they release the original widescreen version
0	if you want a review of the plot itself , complete with spoilers , feel free to read the other reviews . my biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed , again and again , due to the fact that the script writers and director could n't keep the story straight . there is a homage to asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm . that would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film . there are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible . that said , it was a bit enjoyable . the cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given . if the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked , maybe i would have cared what happened to them . the dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say , `` oooh , cool '' . good premise , good effects , good acting , but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film
1	i thought this was an excellent movie . it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time . i just could n't stop watching it . it has an excellent plot that i think a lot of people can understand . it gives you an idea of what goes on when a husband becomes violent with his wife and starts to abuse her
1	i first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80 's . i loved it then and still do today . great story , great casting , great acting great period film making . diane lane is not to shabby either as a strippin ' diva with a taste for the fast life . matt dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table . tommy lee jones , tom skerrit , bruce dern lee grant all contribute with awesome performances to this `` gem club '' of a movie . i sincerely hope we 'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on dvd . heck , i 'd love to have a dvd with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it 's not . i can always dream though..
1	after watching this video i examined the bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy . it helps give the bible life so that you can see the reality of creation , and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history . this is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together
1	first heard his stand-up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back . sometimes he gets a bit carried away ( a lotta comics tend to , though ) , and his comedy comes across dopey , yet easy to relate to . clean ( no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! ) , family-fun comedy ( dirty or clean , as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well , then he/she is funny in my eyes )
1	`` grave of the fireflies '' was one of the hardest-watching movies i 've ever seen , and one i would n't have missed for the world . taking place in japan during the latter parts of world war ii ( though it could be any country in any war ) , it 's the story of two children , seita and setsuko , who are left on their own when their mother dies in the destruction of a small town , and are left to attempt to survive on their own . seita , the brother , is the older of the two and it falls to him to guard and care for his sister setsuko , who 's little more than a toddler . the two hold out hope that their father , a member of the japanese navy , will eventually return for them . seita and setsuko are wonderful and captivating characters who seem uncannily real , making their plight all the more terrifying and heartbreaking . what 's perhaps most horrifying about the whole experience is not just the brutalities of war , because that was to be expected ; but the terribly callous nature of many of the 'ordinary people ' the children encounter during their ordeal . during the darkest days of the war , when logically one would think the survivors would be pulling together , the case was often anything but . even the family of setsuko and seita 's mother does not want to be 'burdened ' with them . although examples of people who react differently do crop up later , for the bulk of the time the children are on their own as ruin befalls the world around them . the children , and the fireflies that setsuko finds , and keeps in a jar , talking to them and feeding them , and releasing them at night to fly about the makeshift shelter seita has constructed . abandoned by humanity , the little glowing insects are the only living creatures the children find companionship with . there are bright and tender , even humorous , moments amidst the tragedy - some of them are overt , others occur in places where the meaning is subject to interpretation . but it remains a harrowing movie , one of the most crushing ever made . extremely haunting , extremely powerful , and , in an odd way , extremely rewarding . there are glimmers and whispers of possibility flitting , firefly-like , through the darkness , and the effect is truly eerie . i 'll refrain from hinting at the ending , but there are certainly a host of moments that sear themselves into one 's heart . if this movie does n't leave you shaken , nothing 's ever going to
1	saw this film recently all the way through thing that grabs you is the natural way the film is presented in 1970 without compromise or hestiation.strogn writing is what carry this film from start to finish.the pacing of the film keeps your attention from start to finish
0	this is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 new york ( there are generous aerial views , lots of location shooting , etc . ) than as a horror movie , even a cheesy one . the special effects are used extremely sparingly , with the word `` special '' being a definite overstatement . some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings , but not by much . in the end , `` q , the winged serpent '' is watchable and certainly not horribly bad , but it 's hard to imagine this being anybody 's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure . to end on a positive note , the dvd features a clean , sharp print of the film .
1	quick and uncomplicated shipping ; the dvd is still with my parents in law in the states - i myself live in germany ; they bring it at christmas - sorry , i can not tell you anything about the qualitiy of the dvd , but i assume , that it is fine such as the shipping . if you want me to do so later , please let me know . that is why i did not write earlier . best regards jessika krau
1	although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it , this is a worthy effort , marked by good acting , direction , technicals , and an intelligent script . although in a state of undress through much of the film , kelly lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors . and , as so often with independent films , all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative . the desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed .
0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 , it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story . wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download ! ! !
0	kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! ! ! this movie is the worst movie of all , all , all , time since the history of the universe and before that ! in theaters i was the only one watching that movie and i felt like walking out ! ! i wanted to cry : ( the actors stink along with the plot and 3-d effects ! ! ! all i can say is boooooooooo this movie sucks
0	this film is about a female student at randolph university in alabama in the early 60 's who is a writer for the school newspaper . she gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement . it could have been a decent movie , but i found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing . a much , much better movie on this theme is the long walk home and also the ghosts of mississippi
1	i saw this movie when i was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago . i ordered a copy through amazon and when i watched it i remembered everything in the film especially queenie hiding in the woods . i like this as it was directed by charles kaufman , brother of lloyd kaufman who made the toxic avenger . i give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a troma inc. release , this is one of the best troma films i have seen
1	vincent price leads an all-star cast in this horror film . price appears in all three segments . in the first , he plays a man named `` locke '' who blames the death of his wife on his daughter who 's just came back after 26 years . this is great , verbal horror sort of like a throwback to `` night gallery '' or other dramatic anthology shows , where the horror is in the character 's personality and not in the graphics . only the final minutes does the story turn into what aip movie goers expect . the second story , as has been voted by mostly all on here , is the stand-out . peter lorre and joyce jameson team up with vincent in a re-telling of `` cask of amontillado '' but re-titled `` the black cat '' . if you 've heard or read the story , you pretty much know what 's going to happen ... the wine tasting scene is hilarious . the final segment offers basil rathbone and vincent although rathbone has the most action as price 's character , valdemar , is bed-ridden . rathbone plays an evil mesmerist who mentally tortures valdemar 's wife and keeps valdemar in suspended animation you could say in an effort to kill him and run off with the wife ! the segment ends with a memorable scene that is n't really sick ... but it 's not for the squeamish , either ! it 's one of rathbone 's finest roles , aside from sherlock holmes and the hilarious nut-case character in `` comedy of terrors '' . this film came along in 1962 . at 85 minutes in length , it 's short for a feature-length film ... but the material and the first-rate acting by everyone make it seem even shorter !
0	it really sucks , tried to download but it 's not able to be viewed in pc 's outsided the united states . crikey . i 'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly . whatta shame amazon dot com . let 's send a csi to yer headquarters
1	i 'm dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page ... guess they just did n't `` get '' it . this film is hilarious . it 's clever , witty and extremely entertaining . travolta is classic as the pathetic `` gameshow-host wannabe '' weather man . the characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways - it 's what makes the film such a classic comedy . it 's unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it . if you liked the big lebowski , orange county , the cable guy - any film with esoteric characterization , you will absolutely love this film . it 's a dark comedy people , get over it
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	`` the last picture show '' is a film of great artistry without being artsy . director peter bogdanovich imbues the film with deep texture but there is a context for this . in other words , this is a film with great style and substance . i do n't know if the studios would bankroll such a film today . it 's not a film that can easily be described but once you experience it you 'll be forever haunted by it . some would say the film is a litany of disparate vignettes but these episodes when taken as a whole cohere . what is amazing is that there are many characters here but all are allowed to develope . it would be fruitless to cite any over the other because it is a true ensemble effort . what 's interesting is that ben johnson and cloris leachman won oscars for their work here . in both cases these are not showy performances but works of great understatement and subtlety . though not unworthy of such accolades , i 'm amazed that the academy would recognize these performances because they do n't detract from any others in the film
1	i could n't resist using the lyrics from a minor threat song in semi-reference to eisenstein 's silent masterpiece . 2 years ago i took a class , `` intro to modern film '' ; i 'm none too fond of classes telling people what to think about film , and how they should be made , but i needed a class , and figured it would be a simple a ; it was , and i was exposed to some new , to me , film makers , who i 'm sure i would have gotten around to discovering anyways ; werner herzog wong kar wai are the two most noteworthy . one week we were discussing `` classic endings '' and among these were , for a reason beyond my comprehension , dead man walking , oh how i loathe sean penn . also included was the vastly overrated ending to coppola 's flat first installment of the godfather series , and then there was the scene from battleship potemkin , the rise destruction of the people in the town square ; copied in the untouchables by the master thief brian de palma . i did n't really pay attention to the scene , i 'm sure because i was tired or just did n't care , but about 2 or 3 months ago i finally got around to getting battleship potemkin from blockbuster online , which is a joke of a deal by the way . it 's a pro-communism film , obviously , but only in the sense of the theory of communism , not the all too often execution of it by human beings , which always ends in some sort of perpetual massive tragedy . the politics did n't bother me as it seems to have gotten to some others ; complaining about how all the actors involved were lifeless , showed no emotion , as to display them all as one collective person , an important aspect of communism . it is certainly a powerful piece , not only for the story telling , but for some of the images ; the imagined hanging of the crew members , the woman on the steps , dead child in her arms , and the gunblast to the eye are all incredible fuel for frightening nightmares
0	just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it . the first movie i ever walked out of , and i was home ! ! ! ! the pits ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	a number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible . honestly , i was not impressed . the plot is disjointed and confusing ; jumping from the north african theatre to the european theatre almost seamlessly , leaving the viewer thoroughly confused . the character development is also very poor . no one character stands out due to the fact that samuel fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue . historically speaking this film is a joke . during the action scenes when the germans have tanks they are in fact american tanks with the german symbol painted on . also , uniforms are sometimes inaccurate . however , the most annoying aspect is the fact that samuel fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the only squad fighting the entire war . only once or twice do you see any other american troops . this feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war , of which these men are supposed to be a part of . finally , to make matters worse , the film 's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical , sloppy , awkwardly placed , and consist of ridiculous situations . overall this movie was too long , lacked character development for most of the movies characters , was disjointed , and was historically inaccurate . for a movie that garnered so much hype i was expecting much , much more .
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
1	the cancellation of this short lived but highly acclaimed series is perhaps the biggest mistake made by a network . ever . fox executives broadcast the series out of order , it was preempted several times for baseball ... it did n't have a chance . *the dvd box set of firefly has been in the top 20 boxed sets in amazon sales since its release in 2003 . not too shabby for a series that was limited to 14 episodes . must be something to it , huh ? give this series the chance it deserves . download # 1 serenity and try it on for size . it 's space westerny goodness all around . if you find you are drawn to this series , come visit us at fireflyfans.net . we 'll be waiting for you with mudder 's milk and strawberries .
1	this movie shows the classic of russian history . people interested in russian culture should definately watch this movie . the plot of the story is really interesting
1	`` splash '' is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80 's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then . i actually saw this movie when it was first released , which is rare for me since i was only a kid back in the 80 's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days . i first bought it on vhs , eventually upgraded to the bare-bones dvd , and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th anniversary edition dvd . i just ca n't get enough of this movie . both tom hanks and daryl hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple . what 's also believable in this movie is daryl hannah 's mermaid costume , which looks so authentic that one almost believes she 's really a mermaid . and let 's not forget the movie 's ending , which is absolutely perfect . there 's one thing about this movie that i 've never understood though : how did it ever manage to escape a pg-13 rating ? in the scene where daryl hannah arrives at the statue of liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial ( and may i add , very nice ) shot of her buns . definitely not material for a pg rated movie . in any event , i guess that will always be a mystery . all in all , `` splash '' is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it . everyone is great to watch , including hilarious supporting roles by the late john candy ( r.i.p . ) and eugene levy . now if only they would release a special edition dvd of `` big , '' another tom hanks classic
1	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville . a prison camp that turned into a death camp . not enough food , water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there . the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers . basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them . a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
0	my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park , a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles . i moved to echo park in late 2004 . it 's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs , dropping-out , and domestic violence . and it 's all here , told through the eyes of latina teenagers . it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played . i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven . i also found myself not caring about any of the characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes to jail . whatever ! as an aside , though , the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called ernesto . luckily , it 's just a coincidence
1	avatar is one of my favorite shows . i am so thrilled that it is on amazon . at first , the episode i downloaded did n't work , but they fixed the bugs . i have it on my creative zen vision : m and it looks great
1	i very much enjoyed this story of a man battling drug addiction-alcoholism.michael keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead-on , even when the film is occasionally hard-going at times.in fact , the whole cast is first-rate , the direction good , and the script unflinching and realistic . of all the films about drug addiction , this one is highly recommended . and the ending is even happy
0	i tried to watch this twice . to see what the hype was . i fell asleep both times . not funny just slow , boring , and stupid . way overated
0	while many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare , there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted , yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror . in my more than four decades on this planet , there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief , disgust and abhorrence that i actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing . it was a film so onerous , pointless and unfunny , that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time , money and talent in the history of western civilization . that film is `` cabin boy . '' to some , `` cabin boy '' may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening 's entertainment , assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper . imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich . that 's the kind of inventive , knee-slapping , laugh-out-loud fun you 'll find in `` cabin boy . '' having some respect for chris elliott 's work on the old letterman show on nbc , i was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor . if it does n't induce deep rem sleep , `` cabin boy '' will surely leave you either angry or depressed . one would venture to guess these were not the results elliott intended . letterman 's genius-level cameo notwithstanding , `` cabin boy '' is about as funny as a prostate exam ... without the `` local '' and the lube .
1	i loved this movie . breathtaking scenery , a simple yet enthralling story , and wonderful acting all around . no drugs , no guns , no over-the-top violence . a nice movie to watch on a rainy day ... .
1	of course this is not the best movie in the world , or even the best french movie . but it is entirely life-enhancing , and shows truffaut 's humanity and humane feeling . it 's certainly a film to watch if you 're feeling low and want to be cheered up . it 's so clever in the way that truffaut deals with himself : as actor playing the part of the director in the film , ferrand , as director , and as , of course , director of the actual film . he gets wonderful performances from jean-pierre leaud ( his other self , here and in several previous films including les quatre cents coups ) , nathalie baye , and most especially the english actress jacqueline bissett ( with whom he is supposed to have had an affair during the making of the film . truffaut is one of the great letter-writers , up with byron , joyce and virginia woolf ( google the book ) , and both his letters and this film show the virtues of catholic atheism : he has not a shred of religious belief , but he is an extraordinarily kind and understanding man who yet can be entirely obsessive about film . watch this if you are down , and pick yourself up with trufo after : a master-work
1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie . it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere . once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since do n't look now back in '73 . this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out , alongside white noise , as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense .
1	the movie has always been a favorite of mine . if you have a big screen tv , this movie on dvd will appear to be sloppy in some areas , but if you just follow the story and enoy the music , you 'll over come the critical nit picking of your prefectionate self . go look in the mirror by the way . i recommend this product for purchase
0	a comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of heaven ( fanny ardant , victoria abril ) and hell ( gael garcia bernal , penelope cruz ) battling over the soul of a mexican boxer is promising , but this attempt at satire , full of symbolism ( hell is represented by english-speaking executives , for example ) , is clumsily executed , only rarely amusing , and the superb fanny ardant is not given anything to do . what a waste ! you 'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors .
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	jet li as a contrac killer ? come on ! the reason why this movie is n't that famous is because it pretty much sucks . it 's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie . no realy kung fu here
1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri-la and its elusive transcendental nature
1	instead of watching a documentary learning the history of brittan ireland in an entertaining way
0	a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film . its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era , but what can one expect ? there is ( at least one ) great movie to be made about that era ; dont look for it here .
0	i bought this dvd for my daughter who is from china and though i think xiao foo is adorable , i am disappointed by big bird 's behavior . not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way , but he tells barkley at one point to `` sic '' the monkey king and then later , again frustrated , tells the monkey king to put his dukes up ( as if to fight to resolve the issue ) . i am appalled by this . big bird is also somewhat demeaning to the chinese people he encounters -- they do n't understand him because he is speaking english and rather than explain the language barrier , he just gets upset . i love sesame street , and although i will keep this dvd to hear xiao foo sing in chapter 7 ( our daughter just loves her ) , i feel i will need to use big bird 's behavior as an example of how not to act
0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 , it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story . wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download ! ! !
1	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things ; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink , decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis . please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama . go for this emblematic film , where paul newman makes a delirious performance .
1	wow , i just viewed `` spun '' the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous . this is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards . `` spun '' has an impressive cast of recognized actors . the film is , essentially , about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts . there is the cook ( mickey rourke , he truly makes this story worth watching ) , who makes the drug ( speed ) and sells it to spider mike ( john leguizamo ) , a dealer with a junkie girlfriend , cookie ( mena suvari , looking infinitely less attractive than she did in `` american beauty '' ) . one of his clients is ross ( jason schwartzman ) , who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend , nikki ( brittany murphy ) . i was surprised at how funny the film was at times . it does n't drown us in anti-drug messages , nor does it become one of those , equally tedious , drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party . the humour is dark , certainly , but funny nevertheless . a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee , patrick fugit , who is caught by a couple of tv policemen ( peter stormare and alexis arquette ) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider-mike . i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead . this is a film with a lot of energy , that seems , like its characters , not entirely sure where it is going , but determined to get there , and quickly . although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober , this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too . the director , jonas ï¿½kerlund , has directed music videos in the past , and it shows in his impatient filming style , as he plays around with animation , speeded-up camerawork and such like . i 'm not recommending the film for its style though , although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen . i am recommending it because i liked the main characters , which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens . i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki , or spider mike and cookie , or even just ross , who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days . what makes `` spun '' better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community , and we feel as if we are watching their everyday , speeded up , sleepless lives . simply amazing .
1	in jean renoir 's introduction to this film the great master cites rumer godden 's book the river as the greatest work of literature about english colonialism in india . i can think of at least two books that are greater , e.m. forster 's a passage to india , and george orwell 's burmese days , two works of literature which seem to indicate that britain 's endeavors in india produced more harm than a few damaged human relations among the english . never the less , jean renoir brings unbelievable beauty to this film , which was his first attempt at full technicolor , and it 's a glorious attempt , called the most beautiful color film ( along with powell and pressburger 's the red shoes ) by martin scorsese . the color has a warm subtlety and grace which can only be described as characteristic as his father 's paintings , cheap as that sounds . is the river the rules of the game of renoir 's color period , as andre bazin claims ? no , i 'm afraid no movie is as good as the rules of the game , yet this is a wonderful and important work all the same .
0	fresh horses , on paper , would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script . you had molly ringwald , with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair . you had andrew mccarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through . you had a romantic triangle . you had the `` class divide '' . the brat pack was loved by millions . how could this fail ? the problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves . there 's very little `` energy '' at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic . molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural kentucky . when her stepfather begins fondling her , and her mother does little to help , molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town , viggo mortensen . she claims she never slept with viggo - only used him for escape . then viggo 's father began fondling her , and now she wants out of this house as well . to get momentary relief from her homelife , she hangs out at a friend 's home , which is a 24 hour party . here she runs into andrew . andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class , wealthy girlfriend . the girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns , having children and living the perfect life . andrew goes with the flow until he sees molly - and is instantly in lust . molly leads him to believe she 's 20 , single , and interested in him . it takes maybe 3 days before he 's sleeping with her . to his credit , he does tell his fiancee promptly , and breaks off the engagement . you 'd think everything was wonderful now , right ? however , andrew learns from friends about molly 's lies . he decides to keep seeing her anyway . however , he does n't want to introduce her to his family , and has no intention of marrying her . he says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex . at one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off . there 's a telling scene near the end when andrew thinks molly has been publicly stripped by her husband . andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with viggo . andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at viggo 's artwork and putting him down . but it 's viggo who is the calm one here . when molly shows up , viggo points out that molly 's been doing all this lying and scheming so that andrew would be a knight in shining armor and ride off with her . he asks andrew - if you 're saying i 'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you 're too good for her , right ? andrew finds himself agreeing - that he wo n't take on molly himself . he wants to get molly away from viggo , but then is going to abandon her to her own means . how could he figure that molly would be better off with nobody at all , vs with viggo ? fast forward to a year later , and molly has in fact found herself a `` wealthy college boy '' to take care of her and is taking classes again . she 's happy , and andrew is sad . i suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical hollywood ending to the story . the landscapes are often gorgeous , and the various details of high class , low class , city , country are all played nicely against each other . so the problem really comes down to the main actors . molly and andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth . you really get a sense of shallowness when you 're watching this movie . andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance , that he 's set in . in just 3 days he 's thrown it all away for molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her . molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either . intriguingly , only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie . one is ben stiller , andrew 's best friend . it 's ironic because ben 's character is shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him . even so , ben really seems authentic as someone who is n't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best , many times , to get andrew to wake up to reality . the other is viggo mortensen . you only glimpse viggo once until the end of the movie - he 's just referred to as a `` rough guy '' who has done many bad things . when you actually encounter viggo ( after andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him ) you 're prepared for the worst . however , viggo is very patient , very well spoken , and quite intelligent in his commentary . he does n't thrash andrew for sleeping with his wife . instead , he lays out the situation and makes both andrew and molly face their failings . molly deliberately lied and used andrew as a tool of getting a better life . andrew , for his part , knew he 'd never actually rescue molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her . some have said this is the worst movie ever . many sections of it can be very painful to watch . however , i do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with viggo . even there , though , you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for andrew and molly . instead , both seem to think , `` yeah , i guess that 's true . oh well , see ya . '' i do n't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact i really appreciate them sometimes . however , if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting , it just makes the whole experience fall flat .
0	this is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies i have ever seen . do n't let the title or the box fool you . every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment . i was shocked that such a film could come out of france . if you 're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass ( verbally and physically ) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job , then rent this and snack on a can of worms . hideous

0	this movie is horrible . i even found the terror that was jaws : the revenge better than this . i 'll list some of the things that made this movie bad . 1 . the acting was horrible 2. the special effect were even worse than the acting 3 . the kids were smarter than the adults ( thats how you know its a corny kids movie ) 4 . the jokes fell flat every singal time 5 . the script was horrible 6 . 95 % of the movie you could tell was on a blue screen i know they were targeting this movie for younger audiences but get real i 've seen alot of family movies that both kids , teenagers , and adults can enjoy . i felt tortured threw this entire movie . i was praying that it would end and i could leave . do n't buy this movie . hell do n't even rent it . its just that bad

1	certain movies really capture the feel of their themes , and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of baseball like no other . of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned . but have n't we learned by now , that the devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals ? i hope so . what a great cast of performers . nothing was lost from the broadway stage in this production . and nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to dvd . through the magic of hollywood , when done to perfection , film can even enhance the story . and few have done the job with a musical as well as this gem . thanks largely to the astounding talent of bob fosse 's choreography . tab hunter 's shining moment . gwen verdon 's 'whatever lola wants ' is the showstopper , but ray walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny devil . a film favorite for most of my life
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
1	wow , this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time -- s & amp ; m , near-nudity , drugs , racism , sex , sex -- you 're left gasping . boris karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing fu manchu . myrna loy , in her pre-superstar days , is his `` horribly ugly '' daughter , who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk , charles starrett , and playing with him like a toy . his nearly nude scenes -- when he wears a loose , constantly shifting diaper -- while she runs her long talons over her glistening torso -- must 've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-code extravaganza . fay wray should have played karen morley 's squealing heroine . silver-haired and elegant lewis stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer . gorgeous photography by tony gaudio , comic book costumes by adrian , art deco settings by cedric gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame to the last . lots of flesh baring by charles and the dark slaves . it 's fun to watch myrna lash her whip over starrett and her `` nubian '' slaves . great quote : `` will we ever understand this eastern race ?
0	private resort is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres . however , i 'm sure this film is one that johnny depp , hector elizondo and rob morrow are n't proud to have on their resume . the movie 's plot is slim , and neither morrow or depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers . elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs , but he 's not at his best either . most of the film 's laughs come from leslie hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo ; dody goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and tony azito as a bumbling hotel security guard . there 's lots of slapstick , some of it works , most of it does n't . you can do better , folks
0	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky , i found `` altered states '' , his first novel , terribly disappointing . the film was , in my view , utterly dismal . the only reason i would recommend it , would be as an example of `` hack movie making '' . if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell , both would be relegated to obscurity
0	okay , i was excited to see this movie . i read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought i knew a thing or two , but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more , i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from . i mean , who cares about these people 's relationships ? ? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail . this movie sucked
1	sadly , the dvd does not contain the special features i had hoped for like deleted scenes or a commentary ... but that does n't detract from the movie which , i think , could n't be more perfect . do you already love michael ? then buy this movie for your collection just to have . andie mcdowell singing about miles , ralph and bradley is worth the price of the dvd all by itself .
0	much like into the sun , this had all the ingredients for a seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great seagal action thriller . the movie is again handicapped in the same manner as into the sun and submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene . it 's as if the camera is turned on and seagal makes it up as he goes along , conversations involving seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand . in seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give seagal an ego boast . `` walks like a black man , breaths like a killer '' , what was that all about ? ? the main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of the order with van damme is used as the opening scenes in this . i also think though i might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the wesley snipes movie undisputed . seagals body double is ever present as usual , seagals line delivery at times is terrible , yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story , seagal love scene ! , fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with seagal movies of late . however it 's not all bad , this is a big step up from submerged , there is no voice dubbing , there are flashes of the old seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings . for me , it was worth the rental as it 's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it . in seagals post exit wounds years , for me belly of the beast is the mark to aim for and his best since exit wounds , with half past dead , out of reach and the foreigner ( & lt ; -- i know people may want to decapitate me for saying that but i like the foreigner ! ) following behind . the worst for my viewing pleasure has to be out for a kill , ticker and submerged ( although enjoyable in a it 's so bad it 's good , kind of way ) . i 'd put today you die and into the sun in the same box as missed opportunities for two excellent seagal movies
1	this two parter commemorates the 10th anniversary of the arthur show on pbs . it 's nice , they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it . really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10 's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how marc brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books . it 's nice to see them both together too ( episodes 1 2 ) , i think they aired them seperately on tv
0	it 's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick , clean , near-perfect minimalist thriller . it 's not that much of the added material ( particularly the internal affairs sub-plot ) feels tacked-on and unnecessary . it 's not even that pacino 's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original , that one of the more complicated characters ( frya selmer/tanya francke ) has been reduced down to set dressing , or that the ending ruins the film 's moral atmosphere . it 's the fact that nolan , a sublimely talented director , is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads . pacino does the method-acting bit again , taking it over the top in every single scene ; hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl ; and robin williams -- well , he 's robin williams . the kids in this film , katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson , turn in fine performances that , while hardly career-makers ( which they could n't be , considering how far their roles have been pared down ) , are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries ' mugging . see the film for their far-too-short performances , but make sure you rent it , and do n't pay too much to do so
0	this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film . sweetie , written and directed by award winning filmmaker , jane campion best known for the film `` the piano '' is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship . one day the womans mentally ill sister dawn `` sweetie '' breaks into their house and lives with them . she is not on her medication and creates havoc . when her father visits after his wife leaves him , he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful . it is never mentioned what kind of illness dawn has . i thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it . the dvd has some great special features . there is a theatrical trailer , behind the scenes photos , audio commentary by director jane campion and director of photography , sally bongers and screenwriter gerard lee . there are interviews with lead actresses , genevieve lemon and karen colston . there is a 1989 conversation between campion and film critic peter thompson made after the success of her short films . finally , there are 3 of her short films made as a student . the first film , an exercise in discipline : peel , is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive . the son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up . the second film , passionless moments ; is a series of short scenes about various situations . the third film , a girl 's own story , is about schoolgirls who do various activities . this film is ok but is not appropriate for children
0	i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king 's short story version in his classic book , night shift . i was excited because king 's story was such good scary fun . well , i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was . while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror , the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze . king 's story was short ( like 10-20 pages ) and sweet , w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields . the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter . the running time is 90 minutes , including about an hour 's worth of padding . cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king 's anthology movies like creepshow . as it stands , it 's bloated and pretty boring . of course , linda hamilton is in it , which is why i gave it an extra star ...
1	its easy to state facts when you talk about the quality of a power tool or a tv . but when it comes to things like movies and music , its all a mater of opinion . my idea of a great movie might be your idea of the worst movie ever made . so its not a good idea to buy or not buy a movie based on someones opinion of it . i liked this movie in fact i just watched this movie 5 min before writing this . if you are not sure if its your cup of tea rent it before buying it . i seen it 10 times over the years and i still like it
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
1	i have loved watching this movie through out the years on tv when offered . the original `` road trip '' . kevin costner 's best movie in my opinion
0	that 's basically my two cents . shallow characters , bizarre story . i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films , but i do like a good story and heard this was one . it was not . all of the characters were inverted - ada and her daughter were utterly irritating , george was disgusting from start to finish , and sam neill 's character ( supposedly the heartless jerk ) was actually the easiest to sympathize with . how frustrating ! on a positive note , michael nyman 's score is unbelievable . i love it
1	i have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and i wish it would come out in dvd . my liking it has something to do with john 's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the direction of the characters through the machine . once he damages the typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again . you ca n't beat that . we even get to see a perplexed robert wagner and the rest of a great cast
0	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy . other than that , it 's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy , predictable , low-budget horror movies from the early nineties . the fx are funny at first , but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy . the acting is uniformly terrible , and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office . confucius overcame many difficulties
0	if i was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film i would be hard pressed to say that oscar and lucinda is about anything for sure.this is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay i have ever sat through.laura jones has adapted peter carey 's novel and gillian armstrong has turned out `` something '' that is so chopped up and nonsensical that , apart from from the very quick shots of new south wales and a magnificent soundtrack by thomas newman , i had to keep pausing the film to say , '' what ? ? ? ! ! ! '' this film is about everything and it is about nothing ; it is about obsession and compulsion ; it is about different religions ; it is about chance and faith ; it is about a father and son ; it is about how a grandson came to be ... ... ... but it certainly is not about two connected characters named oscar and lucinda.each scene of this film is so short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with any of these extremely disconnected people and events.there are so many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong , uncapable and un-understanding hands.it seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in peter carey 's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.what a shock to see the immense talents of a -list actors such as ralph fiennes , cate blanchett , ciaran hinds and tom wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes ! even the breathtaking land of the australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.and the ending ! ! ! ! ! ... ..what in heaven 's name was that ? ? ? either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor ( edited by the noferious nicholas beauman of little women , country life , cosi ) or laura jones and gillian armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed `` butchered '' mess of a movie.2* 's because the thomas newman soundtrack is so lovely , but nay a farthing more ! !
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well . the first one was well done and the acting great . the second one , was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining . this movie , however , was incredibly lame and absolutely boring . my brother went to see it with my mom in theaters , and for some reason they came back saying it was soooo good . when it came out on dvd i watched it with my brother . only twenty minutes into it i was wishing i could leave . all the `` amazing '' 3-d , computer animated sequences were giving me terriblel headaches and i no reason whatsoever to watch this drivel . as a previous reviewer said , the spy kids series lost its charm after the second installment . in this movie they were trying to go out with a bang , but fell miles short of the finish line . the acting seemed stale and unemotional . the humor was lame and not even funny . and the whole things seemed like a weird dream the director thought might make a decent movie . overall , it seems to me that this was just one mega test for the even worse flop `` the adventures of sharkboy and lavagirl '' . i have no appreciation for this director any more and unless he gives us something good fast , i probably wo n't be watching anymore of his films any time soon
0	as curious as i was about this movie it had me dazed . the 'good shepherd ' always struck me symbol for christianity . shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten . what 's good about that ? fortunately , sheep do n't have the intelligence to be paranoid . with bourne identity movies under his belt , matt damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies . is this one a killer or dead on arrival ? with a budget of $ 85m , we 've got oscar-winning actors , writers , cinematographers , and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see . pet project of actor-turning-director , robert de niro , `` the good shepherd '' tells a story of the cia from its early days , weighing in at just under three hours . the scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that 's miss you wo n't get it . this is a shame , because it 's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot . this movie is told from damon 's point of view , its scope is epic , and covering the years from 1939 before the cia was even a speck in president truman 's eye , to 1961 and the bay of pigs . we see the founding years , the london blitz , post-war reconstruction in berlin , and increasingly intricate machinations as the cold war gathers pace . angelina jolie does n't feature in much of the movie , but when she does , she ' get into character very well . it 's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable . robert de niro ( got to love him ) , in the director 's chair , is sadly the weakest link . although he handles it professionally , almost magisterially , he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum , convey gradual moral decay , or make this the godfather standard-bearer of cia films . he 's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew . what he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world 's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity ; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to , given that his mentors are people like francis ford coppola ( who is the executive producer ) . with sufficient dedication , it is easy to imagine de niro pulling off an oscar for direction in a future film : his grasp is very broad , and all it needs is a little tweaking .

0	the problem with this film is i read the book . i was disappointed simply because `be cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent . the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example . somewhere the bulk of the story was lost -- and there are some very -- very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said , `` hey , do n't forget the book ! '' but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit . `` be cool '' provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , the movie would never have been made . a few laughs are provided . a couple ironic scenes show up , but there 's too little to sustain a full-length feature . basically , the project is a disservice to everyone involved . some of the characters are so thin -- face it -- poor christina milian as linda moon , is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings -- a clichï¿½ . the rock does the best he can but again , `he 's a gay bodyguard ; ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji , his boss [ vince vaughn ] , who , in the book , is far more sinister -- but in the film he 's an idiot . of course chili is chili . travolta does a very nice job , and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room . uma thruman 's performance is , well , not funny -- not serious , not intense -- not much -- at best , she made me shrug . i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr , but there 's just not enough , and all the negatives reflect completely on the director . enough said there . my advice , watch `get shorty'again , or read `be cool . '

1	this movie rocks , man . i 'm so happy that they finally produced a stephen king script almost entirely true to the original story . more than that . it 's about 99 % accurate . they added some stuff like a new female character played by julie entwistle , that was n't in the book , but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending . normally i 'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first , but this time i think i can confidently say that even non-readers should like this movie . it 's a masterpiece of suspense and gore . rent it , folks , and call him the `` night flier .
1	the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever . korean , american , does n't matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies . hollywood can not touch this one ! kim myoung min ( yi soon shin ) is outstanding in this ! ( no wonder he won the 2005 kbs best actor award for iyss ) it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional , funny , sad , and can make you angry ! ! the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal ! ! he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that ! my whole family , kids and all , watched this with me and loved it ! i can see why yi soon shin is korea 's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	there are a great many gay themed films available today , but when longtime companion was released , it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes - something that continues to beset filmmakers even today . set during the late 70 's and on into the 80 's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before-and-after portrait of the devastating effects of the aids virus on a small group of close friends/lovers and on the wider gay community . very funny , extremely moving , occasionally upsetting , whether you are a gay viewer or not , this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit .
1	aside from the rather chintzy quality of the disc itself , ( why oh why do n't they re-release the special edition again ? ? ? ) the film is fantastic . kris lemche is , as always , sarcastically funny and somehow very real and relate-able , katherine isabelle is quite convincing in her portrayals of madness and mayhem , and emily perkins is uniquely lovable as the younger sister trying to save her sibling from the woes of lycanthropy . tightly edited , and beautiful in it 's cinematography , this is one indie horror flick you do n't want to miss ! ! !

1	i begged to see this movie in 1985 ! i was only 14 but i knew i had to see it and buy the soundtrack .

0	interesting premise , but the plot is like swiss cheese . this review will just be a point by point of all the major things that i found so implausable that i could n't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride . spoilers alert . i was n't able to make the leap to believing sarah 's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash . when questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions , she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in . just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she could n't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation , but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort , but satisfaction . why did hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it ? surely it would n't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it 's disappearance . the first murder , after the old guy regained consciousness , why did hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him ? for hank , finishing the job his brother started did n't seem like an absolute last resort , it seemed like he took the murder lightly . when hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he 'd just done . what ? like he knew she 'd be understanding about it or something ? hi honey , i 'm home , by the way i just killed a man to protect the money . wtf ? when jacob shot lou to protect hank , why did n't hank just give the tape back before it got to that point ? the shotgun impact on lou 's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous , sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast did n't even hit her at an upward trajectory . and the final ridiculous flaw . jacob taking the fake fbi agent 's gun , and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react , he hands it to his brother , and charges him with the responsibility of killing him , setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film . supposedly the explanation was that it would n't look like the fake fbi agent shot jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range , but why not ? why could n't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff , wrestled with him , and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head ? it really makes no sense . one inspiredly believable moment i will give them film credit for is hank 's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff 's office and loading the gun . a lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded . if the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film . as it is , it 's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch .
1	as soon as i walked out of the theater i declared that i had to own a copy of this movie . i had to wait a long time for it to be released to dvd ( it was in theaters in late winter but they did n't put it to dvd till almost a year later ... probably hoping to capitalize on awards ' season reviews and recommendations ) . it was well worth the wait . it is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards . i think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people ( like me ) more than others . the entire ensemble does a great job . i just rewatched it and i still enjoy it after at least 6 viewings . it would make a wonderful addition to your video collection , especially if you are a michael douglas fan . ( and having a pittsburgh connection helps too ... the movie really captured a lot of the essence of pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground , the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time ! ) . it is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films . there are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts . what a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend . i think the best part is that it is n't non stop action and things do n't get so out of the realm of possibility . it still retains a good touch of believability , even as some pretty unbelievable things happen . pick up the soundtrack while you are at it . bob dylan 's `` things have changed '' is great ( and it recieved an oscar ) . it is mostly a cd to just kick back and relax to .

1	`` in old chicago '' was a blockbuster movie made in 1937 , a box office smash which contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th century fox as a major studio . seeing the roadshow version of this film makes one wonder why fox bothered to put the shorter version on the dvd because you will never view it again . all of a sudden , the dramatic portions of the film make better sense , with the smooth continuity of a henry king directed film and notably missing from the shorter version . all the principals ' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now has more depth . for example , instead of being told don ameche is an honest lawyer , we see him in action ; instead of being told tyrone power is a crook , we see him offering bribes . power , in particular , is very convincing as the charming irish rogue . the story is a corny tale of the o'leary family and has that hokey quality which undermined a lot of fox 's big productions . by the time you have heard for the third time that `` we o'learys are a strange tribe '' , you can almost hope that they suffer some unspeakable death when the fire starts ! alice faye plays belle fawcett , the dance hall attraction whom the crooked power marries . this was faye 's bid for major stardom when she replaced jean harlow who died just before production began . faye is diffident at first but her confidence grows and the film was a great success for her . her version of `` carry me back to ol ' virginny '' is memorable . alice brady won a best supporting actress oscar for her role as mrs o'leary but there is nothing to warrant it except a good irish brogue and the fact that she is playing a serious part for once instead of the screwball mothers for which she was typecast . the special effects which make up the last 20 minutes of the film are spectacular and really give the film the status it has retained . the dvd package contains a couple of short newsreels and a biography program of don ameche but it would have benefited from a commentary for such an important film .
0	every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor/actress in it that everything will turn out good . blue steel is one of those movies . jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties ( or should i say murders ) which she did not commit . sounds like an interesting plot , right ? it would be had the script not been so poorly written . the supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue . aside from the acting , the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises . some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop ( jamie lee ) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her . so why do i give blue steel an extra star ? well , i 'll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television . just do n't pay over $ 3 to rent it and certainly do n't buy it

1	how to steal a million was a light-hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right . audrey hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by peter o'toole an expert in forged art works . the two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper . once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances . greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork . it is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone 's head . dishonesty does n't enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax . everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets . the two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch . mind candy does n't necessarily have to rot your brain . it can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night
0	the original jungle book was inventive , whitty , uplifting and charming . the characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful . the original disney jungle book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child . i can honestly say the original disney jungle book movie was the only movie i loved that also touched my heart . jungle book 2 is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the the original disney jungle book . jungle book 2 fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original disney jungle book . jungle book 2 is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching . you will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of jungle book 2 . do n't waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money . it gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers
1	a documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes does n't seem to promise much , but the story of what was to turn out to be a real-life `` disaster movie '' is riveting stuff . terry gilliam 's obsession with `` don quixote '' is infectious and his enthusiasm for the task he faces coupled with glimpses of what it could have been really make you wish that things had turned out better . the insights into how a film is planned and the hugely complex logistics of a `` live shoot '' are fascinating , while the build-up to the almost inevitable collapse of the project , compounded by unbelievably bad weather and the illness of the central actor , coupled with the impacts of it all on those involved , is about as far removed from the typical self-congratulatory `` making of the movie '' add-on as you can get . finally , the whole sorry affair - in particular gilliam 's persistent unbridled optimism in the face of virtually insurmountable odds as he pursues the chance to realise a long-standing dream - becomes a quite bizarre , tragi-comic parallel to `` don quixote '' itself . you may only watch this once , and renting is therefore probably the best option , but you wo n't be disappointed .
0	i did n't even see this movie and i know it sucks . all that i had to see was bon jovi and i threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out . it was worth it though , it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist . the vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential . i guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as `` vampires - los muertos ''

0	in terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - `` rent '' has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition . yet , it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters . in more traditional musicals , the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable , flesh-and-blood human beings . this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like `` phantom of the opera , '' which seems a natural for this type of approach , but with material like `` rent , '' which is small in scale and intimate in scope , the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience . i know that this play ( and , perhaps now , even the movie ) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers `` rent '' practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism , but to someone , like myself , coming cold to the work , `` rent '' adds up to much less than the sum of its parts . the story , a modern day update of `` la boheme '' set in greenwich village , starts on christmas eve , 1989 , and ends on christmas eve , 1990 . this was at the height of the aids epidemic , and , indeed , many of the film 's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease ( aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story ) . there 's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists ( one is tempted to call them `` deadbeats '' ) from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block . `` rent '' - with its noble `` performance artists '' doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80 's than one from the `60 's . though intended to be the heroes of the piece , the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve , painfully self-absorbed , and annoyingly self-righteous , an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend 's name ( the heavily allegorical `` angel '' ) as the password ( this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man ) . anything`s better than actually working , i suppose , and becoming a tool of corporate america . when one of the men finally takes a dreaded `` job '' ( a mere sinecure , i might add ) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes ( horrors ! ) , he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan , and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-god paycheck . i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them . with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson , the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie , and even though their acting is n't all that impressive , some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing . in his direction , chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production , but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we 're watching . despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ , the film still feels stagy , over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene . as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen , only one tune strikes me as truly memorable , while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling . one of the problems , too , with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian , pedestrian and prosaic - when they are n't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of `` the opposite of war is n't peace ; it 's creation '' - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music . it 's not for nothing that the sharks and the jets did n't actually sing out most of their confrontations . there are , admittedly , some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters , but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture . in that one crucial moment , the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce , taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it . i don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for `` rent '' ( or of its many devoted followers ) , but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially `` sensitive '' artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free

1	when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70 's generation you 're talking about paddy chayefsky 's brilliantly written black comedy , `the hospital ' which was released in `70 . a contemporary , dysfunctional , urban hospital serves as the microcosm of america 's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century , but the mental and emotional illnesses as well . george c. scott stars in the role of dr. herbert bock , hospital administrator . dr. bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity . his wife has left him , he 's estranged from his children and he 's in the grips of a mid-life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question . when a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff dr. bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad . with great performances by george c. scott and the lovely brit diana rigg , `the hospital ' is a thought-provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate . watch it with a friend

0	ok , so i am not a big vampire movie fan , so maybe that had something to do with the fact that i thought this movie sucked . but i am always open minded to all sorts of films , so i thought i would give this one a whirl . it started out with some potential , but within the first 20 minutes i knew it was going to be hopeless . i should have just turned the darned thing off . it was so unrealistic ( ok , i know it 's a vampire movie , so what did i expect ) but i just did n't believe that the main character ( kerr ) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie . and then the girl ( izabella miko ) who had about 8 lines in the movie ; that was just lame and pointless . she must have felt like such a loser telling people , yeah , i 'm in this movie `` the forsaken '' , and i 'm in it almost the entire time ... but ... .ahhh ... .well just call me zombie girl . anyways , i highly recommend a pass on this one , unless you are a complete vampire fanatic
1	i was never a richard burton fan until i discovered this movie.richard burton 's acting in this movie is top notch.burton is able to pull you into his character of british agent alec leamas and make it all believable.thankfully the movie is in black and white , because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film.the dvd transfer and digital 5.1 sound are excellent.it 's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect 's could be so entertaining , but it is.the question is will alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him
1	i thoroughly enjoyed the animals and would have liked more info given about them . the movie is pure entertainment with wonderful color [ except coloring the tiger black ] weird ! they can leave off the technical jargon - i want to hear about the animals and how some of the scenes were shot - how the actors played their parts etc . what rigors did the actors have to go through ? the set making was interesting and oh , yeah , did n't they know anything about horses ? definitely a fun movie
1	track of the cat is an obscure yet brilliant allegorical tale of a snowbound family whose distorted views on patrimony and perceived lascivious behavior , all shaped by the conniving matriarchal beulah bondi , come to a resounding climax after being set into motion by the perceived appearance of a mountain lion . directed by william `` wild bill '' wellman the word `` perceived '' literally describes the haunting images and ambiguous and double-edged dialogue that unfolds . brothers robert mitchum and william hopper pursue the unseen cat across treacherous snow covered mountainous terrain . wellman filmed these scenes on location on mount rainier . waiting in the cabin for their return are tab hunter ( their younger brother ) , teresa wright ( their sister ) , diana lynn ( in pursuit of hunter 's love ) and their parents ( philip tonge and bondi ) . filmed in warnercolor director wellman had cinematographer william h. clothier essentially film the images in a bleached out and colorless `` black white '' effect where everything is shot against a white background . the exteriors of blinding white snow are counterbalanced by the interiors of the cabin whose walls and ceiling are painted bleach white . in contrast , the trees , horses , furniture and actors ( all dressed in dark and/or white attire ) all appear black against clothier 's white cinematic canvas . the effect is unsettling , unnerving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film . the result is that of a nightmarish and haunting tale that eludes the viewer 's sense of morality in a superficial and dreamlike world of black and white where black and white are constantly being juxtaposed redefining what is apparent just for the moment . the vhs copy is in dolby surround stereo
1	nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the cheech and chong movies ( with the exception of the coriscan brothers ) . aside from realizing i should n't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days , i realized how well done they are . most amazing to me was that they held up one after the other , feeling not repetitive , though each of them is rather episodic . most impressive was chong 's direction ; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct ; clearly , he took this role quite seriously . the movies , of course , are not serious . i rarely laugh out loud in movies these days , but i did at least a half dozen times in each of these . the characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver , but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable , and the films all he more watchable .
0	therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 . cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word `` death '' and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school ... except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip can not help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there ... except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went ... but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as `` follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . '' ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as `` elizabethtown '' which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future
0	as ex-infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable . this low budget movie spoils the book . a supposed highlight is the sas field craft , but that 's a bad joke . the sas troop crowds around for camera shots , all the while talking loudly if not shouting . bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best , the sas . the fire-fight sequences are passable . the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it . the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field , should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot , making it unsuitable for many audiences

1	i always have a soft spot in my heart for film adaptations of shakespeare . they are always labors of love , often cribbed together by excellent actors and technicians working well-below scale just for the sheer thrill of working with the bard . even the less-successful productions , such as mel gibson 's turn as the prince of denmark or the recent update of `` love 's labours lost '' win my affection if not my undying devotion . but i had a special place in my heart for a few shakespearean adaptations , such as kenneth branagh 's `` henry v '' and `` much ado about nothing , '' ian mckellan 's `` richard iii , '' and even baz luhrmann 's `` romeo + juliet . '' these were bravura , pell-mell , energetic films that made the bard accessible and personal to me in a way that i could n't get any other way . i had thought that it would be a long time until another film jumped into that pantheon . michael radford 's `` the merchant of venice '' has made the list . a lush take on one of shakespeare 's `` problem plays , '' `` the merchant of venice '' features a reasonably-well-cut two-hour version of shakespeare 's original play , a stellar cast , and a sumptuous visual feast of venetian delights . and , perhaps most surprisingly , al pacino does not overwhelm the entire production by either chewing the scenery a la `` scent of a woman '' or by his sheer star wattage . indeed , in a cast that also features joseph fiennes and jeremy irons , it is a newcomer , the ravishing lynn collins as portia , who nearly steals the show . radiating intelligence , wit , humor , and burning sexuality , collins is a revelation and worth the price of admission on her own . this `` merchant '' also has the courage to leave no doubts as to the relationship between bassanio ( fiennes ) and his lover/patron , antonio ( irons ) . this is a mature , focused , respectful production that honors both its audience and the original source material . check it out
0	michael moore filmed this propaganda , partially financed by the united auto workers , to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants - the japanese auto invasion , made possible by gm 's unhealthy cost structure . the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages , something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal . so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings . years of losses at gm have shown moore 's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers . moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball , but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff , let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain . all of gm 's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross - slow redesign cycles , lack of money for research , you name it . moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice , they find the better value in asian autos . nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor . the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough . enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a `` documentary .

1	this is far too big and rich a film to be contained in any summary description . it is rich in its beautiful depictions of childhood , family , and of sexual love , rich in its narrative of the growth of fascism , and fascist personalities , in pre-ww ii italy , rich in its analysis of the unjust relationship between the owners and the workers of italy 's farm lands , rich in the beauty of its sets , costumes , and scenes . it is a rough , rambling , long film , badly dubbed in the english version , but it is also an indispensable , inimitable , and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern european history . i saw the `` short '' version of the film shortly after its release in 1977 -- it did not have a long run in the united states -- and never forgot it . i saw it again , just now , thirty years later , but this time , the director 's much longer cut . it had lost none of its power .
0	i simply spent time watchnig this french response to a chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture . maybe , it was a top at the timing of the making .
0	i 'm a firm believer in freedom of speech , but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities . the product description listed above is completely misleading . it 's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims , and then at the end they slowly torture them to death . pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen
1	this movie came out when i was twelve and i have been in love with it ever since . it brought me , a rural farm kid , the magic of leonard cohen , concrete blond , was ( not was ) , the beastie boys , and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film . it also brought me christian slater in a role that i would later relate to in a big way as a teen . in short , for reasons all sentimental , i love this film . it may not have cohesiveness in the same way `` heathers '' does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days . so watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school . i know i do
0	this is a review of the 1997 dvd release- thus far , as of september 2006 , the only release i know of . of all of the dvds in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing . without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score , the hilarious comedy and burton 's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to dvd is almost criminal . it probably would n't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches , but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy , devoid of detail and utterly perplexing , given that the movie was shot in the late 80 's . the first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old , battered 8mm film reel . i own a s-vhs vcr , and i have seen better film transfers on video tape . additionally , the extras ... well , what extras ? there are several paragraphs of `` production notes '' which are basically brief overviews of danny elfman and tim burton , but nothing you could n't gleam from wikipedia in three minutes . all that aside , i did pay $ 9 for it at sam 's club , so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but i expected so much more . if you 're a beetlejuice fan , wait for the inevitable criterion collection or special edition remaster .
1	this 1993 movie , based on michael shaara 's book the killer angels , is over four hours long , but it uses that time well to document this critical civil war battle . i used the word `document ' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary . it was even filmed at the gettysburg national military park . when you see the fight for little round top or pickett 's charge , or another fight , you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened . thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle . these amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows . as a high school history teacher , i was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class . when i timed pickett 's charge , i realized it is shown in real time . those confederate soldiers charged into union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie . read the killer angels and then see this outstanding movie . kyle prat
0	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times . it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties . eli wallach is good but confusing -- who and what is he after ? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't . what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better -- less comedy and more plot and of course -- action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare -- -- i would n't
1	like callanetics , this dvd concentrates on the slow movements -- you really must tuck , you really must curl up , or else this dvd is ineffective . unless you can shut off the phone and close the door on the kids , the amount of concentration this dvd takes for getting one 's posture absolutely correct , tucking just right , is not feasible . the workout is indeed effective , and the shortness of it does tend to make one say , `` that was too brief to do anything ! '' surprisingly , it 's not . however , if it is not challenging enough , if you add the bonus blast after doing the lotte berk workout , you really do see results in a short amount of time . it is worth it for the price , but if you really want an all over workout for the cost of two lotte berk dvd 's , check out callanetics
1	this episode is a bit different than the others i have seen , although i have not yet seen all of season 2 yet . without giving anything away , this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings . additionally , it has some inventive guest characters . finally , it presents some moral and ethical questions
0	i found the dvd to be completey inappropriate for children . too much violance and too much swearing . my kids watched 5 minutes of it and its now in the garbage
1	was forwarned about this one..but wanted to experience it myself . the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you . great performances by all the actors . the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage . subtitles not to hard to follow..overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to .
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	after chatting online for 3 weeks , jeff kohlver , a 32 year old photographer , and hayley stark , a 14 year old honors student , finally meet in real life at a cozy local coffee shop called nighthawks . for a `normal ' person , just knowing this age different would make you feel.. uncomfortable and you would think that what they are doing is `wrong ' . but what exactly are they doing ? nothing illegal.. yet . as hayley attempts to flirt with jeff , she is not getting the feedback that she wants . sure , jeff is replying and some of his replies seem as if they would be very sexual . but the way he talks and presents himself to hayley , he seems as if he is not interested in her , even claiming he would have to wait 4 years for her . but when hayley invites herself over to jeff 's home , he accepts . so he must have some interest in her , right ? well he does , but he is n't able to make his move , as hayley makes her move first . after intensive research , study , and stalking , hayley discovered a gruesome past that jeff never wanted to surface , which is the only reason hayley met with jeff . to do justice to.. in her own special way . our knowledge of jeff and hayley now change . jeff kohlver , not only a 32 year old photographer , but a pedophile and a murderer . or at least the accomplice of a murderer . hayley stark , not only a 14 year old honors student , but a vigilante who literally takes the law into her own hands . through torture , which includes castration , stun guns and a call to janelle , jeff 's ex girlfriend whom he is still obsessed over , hayley digs deeper into jeff 's memory and the complete truth is out . hayley gives jeff two options . jeff must commit suicide by hanging himself . making others , including janelle , believe he was just some sad lonely man . in return hayley will clean up all the evidence that would lead police to finding out his crimes . or she will let jeff live and she 'll take off her clothes.. run into janelle 's arms . and the truth about jeff . about his pedophilia . and about his murderous acts . will be out to the public . and his name will be put to shame . jeff chooses suicide . and at the last minute , hayley tells him . she will not hide his past . it is now for everyone to know . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- hard candy is a psychological drama with a very unique and twisting storyline and plot . one that makes you question the movies , the characters , and even question yourself . what kind of person are you if you side with jeff ? sure , he is a pedophile , but does he really deserve all this torture ? and what kind of person are you if you side with hayley ? sure , she is ridding the world of 'evil ' , but should n't she have just gone to the police ? most people just get stuck on the storyline and plot itself and do n't take time to notice the acting , dialogue , and cinematography . patrick wilson and ellen page did an amazing performance , i have never seen better . and the dialogue is so impressive and so striking . some times heart moving , as well as heart chilling . as for the cinematography , the movie is absolutely beautiful . the colors , the shots , really look at it . this movie is definitely a favorite of mine and i give it a 10+
0	im not sure why i gave this a second star ; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with ? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman ( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious `` adaptation '' ) , this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer ( john cusack ) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz
0	a work of fiction is a great thing , but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong . why not just make up a story with no historical basis
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it . they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out . could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again . update : most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection . after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down . i upgraded and this helped . i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours . if you are having trouble read your sattelite `` fair access '' policy
0	okay , ginger snaps one has become one of my all time favorite horror films . i loved the first one , but i dont understand how people can say the sequel is just as good as the first . i had some problems with this movie . first , there were some plot holes actually there was alot of plot holes ( who the hell was the wolf chasing her ? was it sam from the first ginger snaps ? ) . but my biggest problem was , im not even sure.it was boring and not that interesting.we dont even get to see bridgette cause mayhem as a wolf.ghost is really annoying to watch in the film and well i just didnt like this one . i dont understand what people loved aboput this film.the only thing that kept me interested was the fact that its bridgett and actually ginger snaps.i love the sisters characters.but this film just wasnt all that good at all . i still yet have to watch `` the beginning '' , and since its much more expensive hopefully its better
0	so i saw this one live action alice in wonderland movie and it sucked ! ! ! ! but i 'm confused this is n't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie , i think it is . i 'm not sure if i want to risk boring myself with other crap ... so will i watch this verison ever ... who knows
1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east ( mainly china 's ) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy . yi soon shin , however , is a rare exception . not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the chosun political factions ( and the second-guessing nature of the king ) which causes his eventual death . also , the special effects are great . the battle scenes ( whether on sea or land ) are realisitic and of outstanding quality . the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china . then again , this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral . also , the entire selection should have 104 episodes . i do n't know why it stops at 101 . if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject , try samuel hawley 's imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources ) . any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion ( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun : total war by creative assembly ( now in gold version ) .
0	i was forced to watch this movie for college . it was the most vulgar , unnecessary piece of junk i have ever seen . this is a perfect example of the demoralization of america
1	nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the cheech and chong movies ( with the exception of the coriscan brothers ) . aside from realizing i should n't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days , i realized how well done they are . most amazing to me was that they held up one after the other , feeling not repetitive , though each of them is rather episodic . most impressive was chong 's direction ; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct ; clearly , he took this role quite seriously . the movies , of course , are not serious . i rarely laugh out loud in movies these days , but i did at least a half dozen times in each of these . the characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver , but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable , and the films all he more watchable .
1	this a wonderful movie . i had never seen it before . i am 65 and was a teenager in the fifties and an avid movie goer . some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment . it was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other . the old italian movies had a grittiness to them . a reality from far away places where life just had a different style . la strada and the nights of cabiria were from this time . i feel such a pull watching them , wishing things had never become so modern . the bicycle thieves belongs in this catagory . the reproduction is marvelous . clean and smooth . i am glad that this movie has been restored . its a beautiful piece of the past .
0	okay , it 's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion . it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis . on the other hand , the film lacks true suspense . i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn . the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum . the pacing is too slow at times and it just does n't stand up that well today . the actors who took part in this did n't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel . why there was a sequel is beyond me . i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time . at the most this is a rent not a buy . i guess good for it 's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story .
0	note : if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this . ( i 'm giving you fair warning now , so do n't complain about spoilers later ) . the only reason i 'm mentioning the ending and the `` big secret '' is because i 'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment i experienced when watching this movie . when i first walked into the theatre to see this , i could n't have been more excited ; after months of waiting , i 'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time i saw it ! the movie started out wonderfully : great acting , scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds , and , at times , almost unbearable suspense ( that shyamalan really knows how to scare ! ) the story takes place in a small town in the 1800 's . at first this town seems like the perfect place to live : the people are friendly , the houses are cozy , and the scenery is beautiful . despite the peaceful setting , however , we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community , something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from being completely at ease . every now and then , they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village ; nobody ever ventures into it , and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it . pretty soon , we find out why : according to the village elders , there are dangerous , hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain . these creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village ( it attracts them ) . for years , the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding : as long as the villagers stay out of the forest , the monsters will not harm them . at one point , however , one of the creatures enters the village at night , leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack . while all this is happening , we ( the audience ) still do n't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are . it was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end : there are no monsters in the woods . when one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words `` it 's all a farce '' , i still could n't believe what i was hearing ; it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre ! after months of anticipating this film , of expecting a truly scary thriller , and of trying to guess what the monsters really are , there are no monsters ! disappointed does n't even begin to describe it . it got worse , though . the next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the `` monsters '' . the villagers are n't really living in the 1840 's ; they 're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve . supposedly , the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people , but when tragedy struck their families , they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new ( if extremely delusional ) life . the story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth . they even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real ! when the retarded boy died in the woods ( still wearing the stupid costume ) , the leaders , rather than mourning him , remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures . i basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them . what parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that ? i do n't think i 've ever been this disappointed in a movie before ; not only was it completely misleading , but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic ( i 'm sorry , but i have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it ) . many fans of this movie have said that those of us who did n't like it `` do n't get it '' . i assure you , i did get it , and i did n't like it anyway . i 'm no fan of slasher films and i did n't expect this to be one , but i also do n't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters . the two stars are for the cast and the filming . better luck next time , guys
1	i first saw the b original of `` the thing '' in the late 50s ( ? ) , and was totally engrossed ( jumped out of my seat with the rest of the audience , at one point ) - so i knew generally what the plot might be . the story line and characters here were pretty much the same , dressed up in color and hi-tech research equipment . nifty vistas of alaska 's bleak beauty , and a satisfying high-tech rendition of the half-uncovered alien saucer . the suspense and drama were nonstop , and the characters interesting , individual , and credible . it was a relief that the standard beuatiful female scientist ( or alien ) was omitted for a change . the thing was believable and suitably gory and menacing , even if a little stereotyped ( eg long slavering fangs , powerful tentacles , bulging eyes , and dripping goo ) . it and the other special effects were well done , and worth the price of admission . i wo n't comment on the ending to avoid spoiling it for you , other than noting it reminded me of the old folk tale `` the lady or the tiger . '' engaging , entertaing reality-escape flick
0	tom berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film . it has the feel and tone of the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a sunday afternoon when you 're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen . the acting is wooden and unnatural , and the music , which is supposed to be awesome , sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of springsteen , even though the flashbacks in the film ( when most of the musical scenes occur ) are set , for the most part , in 1963 , when nothing sounded like springsteen . worse yet , the sets do not look like 1963 . this is very clearly a cheap production , doomed from the start by an awful script , terrible acting , and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era . here 's the premise of the film : years after eddie , the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the cruisers , has disappeared ( he died in a car accident , but his body was never recovered ) , a reporter decides to write a story about the band . she has a theory that eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance , if the missing final recordings , named a season in hell , can be located . she forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members , who are , by the way , dull as dirt , to piece together the band 's history . the reporter is so creepy and annoying that she 'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her , nowadays . ironically enough , a season in hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience
0	years ago , a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends , and decide to keep a secret . years later when they 're all in high school , the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them . your typical 80s horror film , not very notable other than leslie nielsen , and jamie lee curtis . this is one prom , better left unattended
1	the best visual experience available ... and the sound may still be the best part . i 've watched this over 20 times and still find elements new to me . i have bought this as gifts and have recommended it to very many who want a high end visual show
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	my almost 3 year old loves it . she does n't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited ' but she 's been able to overlook them . she and i love the music together . that 's why i bought it in the first place
1	jamie lee curtis plays a college co-ed who and her friends throw a party on a train , and a killer is amoung them ... . a good slasher movie of the 80 's , david cooperfield plays a sexy magician , who forms his wonderful magic , almost putting a spell on those ladies around him ... . just remember jokes could kill you ... ... ..
0	i love sophia loren as an actress however this dvd as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality dvd . colors are bad , picture is bad and the sound is even worse . do n't waste your money . my dvd copy was bought from amazon . this is my advic
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	if you want a review of the plot itself , complete with spoilers , feel free to read the other reviews . my biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed , again and again , due to the fact that the script writers and director could n't keep the story straight . there is a homage to asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm . that would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film . there are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible . that said , it was a bit enjoyable . the cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given . if the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked , maybe i would have cared what happened to them . the dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say , `` oooh , cool '' . good premise , good effects , good acting , but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film
1	this was a hilarious movie even though i have never seen it before . it had alot of funny scenes . but as david rigsbey says it had no direction
1	frank tashlin and jayne mansfield -- a marriage made in cartoon heaven . who better to point up the absurdities of pop culture,1950 's style , than mansfield , with her little girl squeal , breathy delivery , and protruding gunboats . she resembles nothing so much as marilyn monroe on steroids . and tashlin , with his gift for social satire and cartoonist eye for exaggeration . notice how cleverly sight gags are inserted to stress a point -- an overheated kiss that pops popcorn , a computer read-out that mimics the dialogue , celebrity-mad teen-agers that pour out of a man-hole . notice too , how in the end , tashlin confronts the glamorous but artificial world of advertising with the unglamorous but authentic world of living things . in a subtle way , tashlin 's subtext undermines the image-obsessed 50 's by anticipating the back-to-nature 1960 's . all in all , the movie remains a revealing document of its time . it also serves as a perfect vehicle for the arch talents of mansfield , the rubber-faced henry jones , and the nebbish tony randall . in fact , the scenes between jones and randall are among the most deliciously droll of that era , while jones remains one of the most unusual and unsung among hollywood character actors . still and all , it 's hard to exaggerate what was already extreme about that glossy decade -- the absurd mammary worship , the vacuous teen-culture , the mindless consumerism . nonetheless , all get nailed in this inventive little spoofery that remains not only pretty funny in its own right , but reveals a lot about a decade that in many ways is still with us
1	it all started with john malkovich . me seeing the movie i mean , not the film itself . i was scanning through malkovich 's filmography and saw this film in their . i had heard of the film , but had no idea what it was about but i checked it out . malkovich is close to top billing , but his role is really small ... having said that , this was an amazing film . truly a work of art . the movie stars sam waterston ( 'serial mom ' ) playing sydney schanberg , a new york times columnist who heads to cambodia on the brink of war . bombs have been dropped , labor camps have been set up and schanberg wants to write about all of it . when he gets there he meets dith pran ( haing s. ngor , who won an oscar for the role ) , who becomes his friend and interpreter . malkovich plays schanberg 's photographer al rockoff ; his role is brief , but he leaves his mark . after schanberg 's war entraps himself and his fellow journalists , pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp . the script is based on a new york times article by schanberg called the death and life of dith pran . when i saw that , i figured this would be a rather depressing story . truth is , the film is quite uplifting . the choice to use john lennon 's `` imagine '' for the final scene was perfect . anyway , back to the synopsis ... schanberg is back in new york , while pran slaves at the labor camp . schanberg has no idea whether pran is alive or dead , but does n't give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend . most films that take place in this setting , i 'm not a big fan of . i 'm not saying i did n't like these films , but movies like the constant gardener and beyond borders are a bit like this movie . although , for the record , this film is way better . having said those last two things i was surprised that i liked this film . whether you 're a fan of these kinds of movies or not , you need to see this . it 's an important and uplifting movie , that no one should not see . grade : a

1	spanish-born actor javier bardem gives a staggering performance as cuban poet reinaldo arenas , which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film . in fact , he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long-winded , piecing together as it does the various episodes of arenas ' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process . at the same time , this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post-revolution persecution experienced by cubans more effectively than either carlos eire 's memoir , `` waiting for snow in havana '' , or hollywood confections such as sydney pollack 's `` havana '' or richard lester 's `` cuba '' . director julian schnabel , an artist himself who had previously directed a film about celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat , jumps back and forth like an abstract painter clarifying time periods by employing captions . we first see arenas ' birth in 1943 rural cuba followed by glimpses of his poverty-stricken childhood . the story then moves forward to 1958 just before castro rose to power and when arenas becomes a revolutionary living in eastern cuba . by 1964 , as both an open gay and an intellectual , arenas ' writings have made him anathema to castro 's regime . for the next fifteen years , he shuttles back and forth between jail and freedom , and arenas ' story sheds much light on the difficult of living as a member of not just one but two minorities . in highly visual terms , schnabel creates a striking tableau of life in cuba that shows how getting out of cuba was not an easy decision for natives to make , and arenas , like most cubans , makes it only begrudgingly at first . imagine having to give up everything and fleeing . there is a vividly filmed sequence of an all-night party in an abandoned convent that houses a homemade hot-air balloon ( shades of jules verne ) by which one of them decides to escape selfishly and fatally . there are also some powerful scenes that show the humiliating torture arenas experienced in prison ending finally with his escape and ultimately his departure from cuba in the mariel harbor exodus of 1980 as one of castro 's `` undesirables '' . arenas then went into exile in new york living with his former lover , lazaro . sadly , soon after his arrival in america , he became ill with aids . the american sequence is short , allowing maximum time for the cuba ordeal that makes up most of the film . the charismatic bardem is superb capturing the emotional combustion in his character 's life . there are a few guest appearances that somewhat undermine the story 's realism , a nearly unrecognizable turn by sean penn as a cuban peasant and in dual roles , johnny depp as a sadistic , closeted lieutenant and a transvestite named bon bon , who entertains prisoners in el moro prison . and the use of english versus spanish seems to be more at the director 's discretion than the actual circumstances within scenes . but these are forgivable indulgences since schnabel has made a valuable film telling a tale of cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly do n't see that often in film . at 133 minutes , it does seem a bit overlong , but arenas packed a full life in his 47 years . most importantly , schnabel successfully paints a picture depicting the influences behind arenas ' writing : his difficult childhood , his conflicted feelings for his mother , coming to terms with his sexuality , the revolution in cuba , and the pain of being an outcast in his own country . as one might expect from a painter , schnabel uses images as effectively as words to advance the story . most are simple and quite beautiful , such as an early scene of a rainstorm that turns into a raging torrent of water , a later shot of countless prison inmates dangling bars of soap outside of their jail cells , or flashes of snow falling in new york as arenas and his friend lie on a speeding convertible . nevertheless , because arenas , as a writer , dealt in words , it is impossible to tell his story without embracing this component , and bardem 's economical voiceovers attest to that aspect in a dramatically effective manner . strongly recommended in spite of the relatively minor flaws . the dvd also includes an interesting french television interview with the real arenas from 1983

0	it 's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick , clean , near-perfect minimalist thriller . it 's not that much of the added material ( particularly the internal affairs sub-plot ) feels tacked-on and unnecessary . it 's not even that pacino 's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original , that one of the more complicated characters ( frya selmer/tanya francke ) has been reduced down to set dressing , or that the ending ruins the film 's moral atmosphere . it 's the fact that nolan , a sublimely talented director , is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads . pacino does the method-acting bit again , taking it over the top in every single scene ; hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl ; and robin williams -- well , he 's robin williams . the kids in this film , katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson , turn in fine performances that , while hardly career-makers ( which they could n't be , considering how far their roles have been pared down ) , are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries ' mugging . see the film for their far-too-short performances , but make sure you rent it , and do n't pay too much to do so
0	having been a teenager once , i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience . however , in pump up the volume , the movie 's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens . the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior . even our hero ( well played by christian slater ) can not communicate with people on a one to one level ; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them . as a proponent of truth , he is a vapid antithesis of truth : he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths ; he does n't use his real name or voice ; and on a call with a potential suicide victim , he treats the caller as someone who is n't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation . the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure , but is n't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise ? the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes . sorry , folks , been there done that ... living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right . questioning authority without any viable alternatives , as none of these teens do , merely escalates the generational gap , and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth

1	james wong howe 's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored dvd version of this underrated film , an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance . it was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm , that is , among people with the money to afford them . the unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from brueghel , but even the whole weight of the mining companies can not extinguish the inner spark in their eyes . filmed by the left-leaning director martin ritt , freed up from the blacklist that crippled the earlier part of his career , the molly maguires finds ritt at a curious place , picking at the ugly scab of us history that the scandalous molly maguires represents . indeed historians argue whether or not there was ever a conspiracy among fenians to bring down the oligarchy of the oppressive coal mining companies through so-called `` shillelagh law . '' ritt was able to attract not only richard harris but top-billed sean connery to this project ; for each of them a commercial risk . indeed the movie , re-edited at the studio by nervous bosses , probably does n't represent the script that connery and harris read . samantha eggar , one of the loveliest of 60s screen actresses , took the leading women 's role which was turned down by anjanette ( loved one ) comer . oddly enough , thirty years later , comer took the minor part of `` sue '' in tv 's recreation of the nine miners in pennsylvania who were rescued from the quecreek cave-in in the summer of 2002 . yes , the film is depressing . yes , it is slow-moving , sparked by moments of intense brutality . but give it a chance and savor its unique blend of 1870s locations and 1970 radical filmmaking
0	`` four brothers '' is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career . the director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty `` boyz n the hood '' - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again . the story , reeking of artificiality , features mark wahlberg , tyrese gibson , andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother . when she is killed in a convenience store robbery , the quartet launches into action , seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced , through their investigation in the neighborhood , that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe . the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters . by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother ( except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student ) , we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith , rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best . the acting is uniformly flat , with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes , and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the singleton pedigree in this area . the boys ' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood , brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer , is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque . with nary a single moment that rings believable or true , `` four brothers '' is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more .
1	when i watched this classic documentary , i could n't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here , we just would n't make it . what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls , body-piercing , hummers and rap music , underneath it all is a heritage that is raw , rich and admirable ; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up . it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now .
1	given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business , it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed , darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves , and becomes a certifiable classic in the process . following the story of eddie adams , a simple-minded , almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was . paul thomas anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry , with anderson pulling out every trick in the book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie-within-a-movie views , and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness ( dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example ) . naturally , anderson also loads the movie up with period details , right down to the farah fawcett poster in teenage dirk 's room , the platform shoes , and the obligatory disco sequences . its visual flair aside , though , boogie nights is also the sort of insanely quotable , watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties ( trainspotting , fargo , goodfellas , swingers , true romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade . this movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it , especially its murderer 's row of a cast -- burt reynolds ( jack horner ) , don cheadle ( buck swope ) , john c. reilly ( reed rothchild ) , julianne moore ( amber waves ) , william h. macy ( little bill ) , luis guzman ( maurice rodriguez ) , tom jane ( todd parker ) , philip baker hall ( floyd gondolli ) , philip seymour hoffman ( scotty jay ) , and alfred molina ( rahad jackson ) all figure prominently -- and even wahlberg ( dirk himself ) and heather graham ( rollergirl ) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors . that said , what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters , who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like . the main characters almost entirely have hopes , aspirations , and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession -- jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker ; dirk 's ridiculous pseudo-karate and reed 's equally ridiculous poetry ; buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store ; amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son , which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars -- helping us see them as fleshed-out characters , not just plot devices in the story . since there is n't really a plot to speak of , the movie is told as a series of episodes , goodfellas-style , with several extended pieces -- the pool party at jack 's house where eddie/dirk gets introduced to the whole crew ; the new year 's eve party celebrating the start of the '80 's ; the fake drug deal gone bad at a rahad 's house -- serving to turn the narrative in new directions . this last set piece -- when dirk , reed , and todd head over to rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory . it starts off almost surreal , with a skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and rahad ( clad only in underwear , a bathrobe and slippers ) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80 's songs on a mixtape . from there it just gets progressively darker and tenser , with the lighting , acting , and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control . molina 's over-the-top performance , more than anything else , makes the scene , as he turns rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and , later , a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge . i would n't say molina turns in the best performance i 've ever seen in a movie , but it it probably the best performance i 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie . the '80 's are , of course , the hangover from the joys of the previous decade , as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , and dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one . fittingly , as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties , the movie takes a darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast and a lot more violent , but no less compelling . all the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present , just in a decidedly less sunny form . even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right , the movie 's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away . well , except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end , but by then i for one did n't care .

0	what this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes did n't help either . bruce willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his bob moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group , bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective . there is also a young atractive woman played by jane march who gets involved with bruce willis 's character dr. bill capa , the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller . now i 'm not a big fan of bruce willis but i have seen much better films with him in it than this including die hard trilogy , last man standing and the sixth sense

1	i just finished watching callie and son . i got my copy from the dollar store and it has another movie ( power passion and murder ) with michelle pfeiffer in it as well ... it really was n't that bad , considering the price i paid . lindsay wagner is actually the main character and i think she did a great job , as did most of the actors in this film . the only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to . with a bit of editing and a bit better script , it would have been a great movie ! the end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying ... i 'd recommend it for someone to watch once , but i would n't pay more than i did for it . the dvd quality is really poor , the sound fades in and out , but for what it was , a bargain bin cheapy , i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it .
1	we rented the lorax because i realized i had n't seen it since 1978 on a reel-to-reel tape in my elementary school library but i loved it . somehow 27 years later i knew a lot of words to the songs , but was struck by how much the message of the movie is relevant today . if anything , these days this movie would not be shown in a public school or on television because the fcc would investigate its subversive message of enviromentalism , critique of consumerism , and caring for others . as for pontoffel pock his magic piano - i have no memory of this movie , and i have to say that it is one of the most bizarre things i 've ever seen . let 's just say theodore giesel meets timothy leary and ken kesey and keep it at that
1	sure the summary of the movie is n't eye catching to some , but its a movie that should be seen , damnit ! i mean it . this is a story about a little boy named ingemar whos relationship with his loving mother slowly falls apart due to her sickness.ingemar is soon sent away to live with his uncle and aunt for the summer.this movie is charming and has a great cast of quirky charcters
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim ... and we wonder why our community has so many problems..maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films ... '' color purple '' , `` for colored girls ... . '' etc . we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we `` work together '' ... that means blackmen and blackwomen..

0	opera is intended to be seen - a true multi-media art . but a fascinatingly perfect stage setting aside , this is one production better heard than seen . sonically , the performances please , but this rates as one of the more visually disturbing casts i have witnessed . a 58-year-old plcido domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier . aprile millo , as a well-fed version of the ethiopian slave girl ( in ridiculous black face ) , aida , defies the costumers ' best attempts to provide a waist line . and dolora zaijick mirrors a middle-aged matron more than the egyptian princess amneris . a fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities . like an emperor , the metropolitan opera stands as a respected authority . perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act , but the emperor has no clothes - or at least they need ironing . these are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera . huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased , but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate

'' helloooo this was made in the '70s ! of course this movie and it 's material is original , kind of a noo brainer and whomever gave that critic her job should ctique themselves on why in thee world they gave her the position . someone should tell that critic , paula self-check or whatever , that she has no idea as to what she is talking about and if people all over believe critics like her , that such timeless masterpieces such as this movie `` is no good , '' excellent or even a decent movie for that matter , no movie worth watching would get any attention so judging for yourself would be `` thee '' best option
1	i read a negative review of this show but i just watched it and it was better than foretold . i expect it will do better than people think . it 's basically a danielle steele novel come to life . courtney cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a los angeles gossip magazine . the other characters are troubled celebrities ( who have sex a lot ) . the show feels very contemporary . it is definitely a drama . despite moments of levity , it is basically a dramatic story . in any case , my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun .
0	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa . so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd , i decided to rent it on netflix . it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish , and the kids , while cute , outsmart all the stupid adults . the first 30 minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango , including the steam train ( that 's why i purchased a used copy ) but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore , intended for young and undemanding children . do n't bother unless you love durango as much as i do
0	i just purchased the 2 disc , special edition of this movie , and here 's my problem ( s ) : first off , i do n't speak italian , so my only options are to watch the film with the english dub , or with the italian dub with the english subtitles , but here 's the problem ; the english dub is out of sync with the film , sometimes being only slightly so , but other times being very noticeable and distracting ( i.e . during loud sound effects , such as a chair being knocked over , or someone knocking loudly on a door ) . and so my other option is the italian bud with the english subs , but here 's the problem with this , the english subs are missing during the scene where peggy is reading the diary ( about 30+ minutes into the movie ) . now , i had noticed missing subs during the first part of the film , but these where usually during background conversations , or occasionally a line would be missing from someone 's speech , but could usually be figured out , and these where only slightly annoying , but the missing subs for the diary entry is inexcusable ( and is also missing from the other subs as well ) as this is an important bit of info to the plot of the story . also , when you set up the audio option , from the main menu , there 's no problem , but i found that if you use the audio button on your dvd remote , the italian option gives you the french soundtrack and the french gives you the italian one . it 's nothing serious , but it 's an annoyance all the same . so , does anyone else notice these problems , or did i just end up with a bum disc
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
0	this is an extremely dry anime . the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor . not so for the anime . the character batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version . expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking . these really make the movie crawl . one minute there 's action , next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism . seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 of the movie . the visuals are awesome , no question about that . even so , they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story . altogether , not much actually , happens during the movie . if you must see it , rent it first to be sure you want it

1	this is bresson 's greatest , and last , work . it is a work from a true cinematic auteur . no one made films like bresson did , and i do n't think anyone ever will . this film is based on a short story by tolstoy entitled the forged coupon ( aka the forged note ) , except tolstoy 's story is much different that bresson 's take here . it is about how a forged note of 500 francs passes from one hand to another , ruining the life of a fuel oil delivery man . bresson made this film when he was 82 , but you could n't tell that it was made by a man that old . quite often , critics assume that filmmakers ( and artists in general ) have nothing to say as they get older . on the contrary . they have even more to say . a real artist 's vision deepens as they grow older . kurosawa made ran at 75 , and eastwood made million dollar baby at 74 . those are their best films . bresson is rather feisty and combative ( which is a good thing ) in the interviews presented here . he does n't mince words , and he does n't seem interested in doing the usual inane questions that featurettes on dvd 's usually have from bubble headed reporters ( even though these were shot for french tv , not entertainment tonight ) . he has something to say . this is my favorite film of his ( even though lancelot of the lake and au hasard balthazar are close behind ) . sadly , he never made another one after this , but the 13 he did make are all brilliant . not one bad one . great film , great man ...

0	friday the 13th , part v - a new beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot . the acting is much worst then in prior movies . the script is awfull like on a police academy parts 4 and onwards level and that is nothing short of terrible . the special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie . the music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst 80 's music i have ever heard . i love the 80 's hairdoes , the tacky cheap looking clothes , and the make up is atrocious.the dialogue is so bad that one wonders if it is a highschool project gone awry . the killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas . the movie is only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all . this is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs
1	a consortium of business types gathers in a manhattan penthouse and sneers at the little people , a slightly overdrawn look at capitalism . these guys are so awful they make the capitalists in a lars von trier film like manderlay or dogville look like albert schweitzers . the fattest cat is john r. frost , played by eugene pallette in an extremely broad mode , almost as though he were tony soprano as a hillbilly . he makes an unlikely financier ! deanna durbin has a tough part here , she 's always in center stage but most of the time she just has to bug stokowski until he finally relents , and you can sympathize with him , for she takes what we now call `` stalking '' to new lows . the two of them are equally good at acting , and stokowski in particular is a surprise . he could have been a major screen actor on the model of , say , claude rains . his huge mop of white hair alone commands attention , and he speaks beautifully , losing dignity only ( strangely enough ) when he 's conducting ! as my pal mac mcginnes points out , `` when oscar levant was asked what great moment in musical history he wished he had witnessed he said , 'the day leopold stokowski discovered he had beautiful hands . ' '' durbin will wring tears from a stone when she is forced to retreat home without getting her way from the great conductor . she sits on her magnificent bed ( looks very grand for a poor street urchin , with great golden rods forming a unique bedstead ) and cries her heart out , insisting that adolphe menjou her dad deserves a job , he deserves `` a fur collar on his coat , and , and , turkey on his birthday -- instead of beans , '' she sobs , her pretty face contorting in what looks like real anguish . she is an rivetting performer
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
1	great movie , definately original and something many chicanos living is socal can relate to or be familiar with
1	prom night is a disco-classic slasher frenzy that will make you watch it over and ove
1	fall in love with nestor the sweet little loveable long eared donkey and his friend telly the cherub . this is a wonderful heart-warming story of a `` ugly-duckling '' sort , the story of a little donkey with a heart of gold , but big long ears . he becomes a huge hero by carrying mary to bethlehem safely . tells story of the first christmas . this one will make you cry , but it has a happy ending . it is a true must have christmas classic
1	i have n't read them all , but it seems to me that most of the reviews here are about film technique . in addition to being ground-breaking from a director 's standpoint , it 's a great story . i 've seen the richard gere version , and frankly , all i remember about it is the mtv music video for the theme song . the original gave me a completely different perception of the story , and the ending surprised me . i thought jean-paul belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character . there 's a press conference scene that i thought was important to the story , as well . i wish i spoke french , because i think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles , but nevertheless , i think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
0	expecting sexy camp in the tradition of `` beyond valley of the dolls '' i was really looking forward to seeing this film . instead i struggled through this tedious , repetitive , and confusing mess of a film . i respect what the director was trying to create , but the end product is nearly unwatchable . it 's starts out so well too ... . `` i tried not to remember why i buried my trumpet . '' ... but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that is n't the least bit sexy or interesting . i know this film has a sizeable cult following . it is pretty to look at ( sometimes when it is n't in grainy slow-motion ) but i just could n't make it through . maybe it 's worth a look , but i personally wish i had rented it
0	do n't waste your time or money with this dvd . the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also . my dvd came loose in the package and scratched , too bad it did n't do any damage to ruin the movie . i could n't wait until the movie was over , i would have stopped it earlier , but wanted to see if any damage was done . you 'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier . the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off . do n't waste your money , spend it on the cheap $ 5-6 horror dvd 's , because at least those can be somewhat entertaining
0	this is my favorite production of the alice books . i love the sets , songs , and casting . it 's also very british , which i think adds another great element to the mix . however , skip this dvd edition . i got it , excited to see alice 's adventures in wonderland in widescreen and , perhaps a better print than what 's previously been available . no such luck . the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that 's been out there for ages . faded colors . pan-and-scan . in this age of dvd , quality like this is such a shame
0	save your money or give it to charity . this is one of the worst films for a long time . the characters are one-dimensional , you do n't care who they are and when they die , you 're indifferent . the direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory . i was so bored with this film that i ca n't even bring myself to write anything else about it
1	the first time i saw this was on abc . i thought , oh my gosh what the heck is this movie . i just could n't stop watching . before i knew it , i was sucked in to the plot . i absolutely ! love ! this movie ! i ca n't wait to watch it again and again and again ! -ale
0	i watched this movie , seeing that it was a `` shark '' movie . but where 's the shark ? ? the plot is these people are hostages . the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie . but i was watching going , `` okay , they 're in the water , where is the shark ? ? ? '' even jaws 3 , ( which sucked ) has more sharks . if you like hoatage movies , see this . ( on second thought , do n't ... ) but if you like sharks , see something else
1	i just watched the second half of guarding tess on tbs . it 's now 11:30pm , and i am writing this review when i should be in bed 1 and half hour ago . nicolas cade and the old woman in the movie both turned in great performances . the story was lightly funny at first , but did n't really go anywhere . the relationship between the fbi agent and ex-first lady was strange , and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation , it was still weird . the climax came at the end , and was very entertaining , for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot . there is much meaning in the movie ; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life . i was touched by the movie . thank you . i should go to bed now
1	sure , it would have been great if the chuck jones and dr. seuss alliance would have continued for this outing ( their `` how the grinch stole christmas '' and `` horton hears a who '' are unquestionable classics ) but this is a noble effort.. a very noble effort . `` the cat in the hat '' was always been my favorite dr. seuss book . having said that , i felt the top notch vocal talent ( allan sherman will forever be the cat in the hat , sorry mike meyers ! ) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme ... and the geisel penned songs were truly inspired ! so the animation is a little off . this is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter
0	this has got to be one of the worst films i 've ever seen . the characters are pointless and one-dimensional . the guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy . they have sudden fights over apparently nothing . in fact , there is no cause-and-effect in this movie at all ! things just happen randomly for no apparent reason . there 's no real story . the takes are boring ; most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing . the violent ending was n't even believable ! instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy , i was left just thinking `` what the ... ? ? ? '' really , really pointless all around
1	one of mikio naruse 's last masterpieces was 1960 's `` when a woman ascends the stairs '' - it is also one of only two of the great director 's films currently available in any video format in the u.s. but wow , what an introduction it is ! this seemingly modest film about a woman on the edge of a precipice , winding her way through dismal back alleys and cheap bars in search of an out is one of the great character pieces in world cinema . crisply shot in black and white widescreen ( which is admirably reproduced in this edition ) , this beautifully directed and acted film is an absolute must for anyone interested in movies . the sadness lies in the knowledge that this kind of film is not made anymore ; there 's no one talented enough to pull it off nearly as well . class and subtlety are a rare commodity and this film has just the right amount of both . it 's perfect , one of the greatest films of all time , one i come back to again and again
0	look ... to be fair , one man 's bote is another man 's `` manos '' . what i mean by that is some people may love this ep , but i personally did n't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing does n't save it . the best lines that mike & amp ; the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says . unfortunately , the feature 's horrible pacing , slow dialogue scenes , and atrocious acting are not enough , and it seems like the writers took a break on this one . of course , even weak mst3k is better than pretty much any other show , but i must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a season 1 episode ( the riffing is sparse and not really funny ) . if you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it 's best , get either `` manos : hands of fate '' or `` red zone cuba ''
1	bones is one of my favorite tv series . this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track . great show even if you have never seen it from the begining
1	a comedy with a bitter sweet edge , `` the purple rose of cario '' has a fairly simple premise . cecilia ( mia farrow ) struggles to make ends meet during the great depression . her husband monk ( danny aiello ) is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent . the only escape that cecilia has is going to the movies -- the fantasy world of hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world . her favorite movie `` the purple rose of cario '' featuring gil shepard ( jeff daniels ) as tom baxter ( also jeff daniels in a dual role ) changes her life when the character tom baxter walks out of the movie into the real world . he says he 's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except cecilia 's sister cares about . the rest of the characters in the film ( edward herrman , milo o'shea , deboarh rush , zoe caldwell , john wood , van johnson ) are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is . `` purple rose '' is one of allen 's most complete films and captures all the wistfulness that lurks in the background of his films . this dvd looks extremely good considering that the transfer is from 2001 . there 's some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly on screen but , on the whole , it 's not a big deal . allen has n't done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there 's cut footage of viggo mortensen and michael keaton ( who was originally cast in the lead instead of daniels ) that would be of interest . i do n't know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this . why mgm did n't choose to include archieved footage of allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me . this oscar nominated ( for best screenplay ) film certainly deserves a documentary on its making or , at the very least , a featurette . we do get the original theatrical trailer and a booklet that discusses the making of the film . a great movie that will hopefully get better treatment when it ends up on the blu-ray format , `` purple rose '' is still a treat and well worth picking up . it 's also priced well at $ 12-14 at most retail outlets and at amazon.com
0	i originally read the novel ( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware ) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled `` memory and mourning in post-war germany . '' i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel . it seems that the director wanted to make a more `` hollywood '' version of the film , and i think he succeeded . for instance , the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel , and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story . in general , the film has little to do with any of the original versions , and is far inferior
0	this movie is not for you if you can not handle movies just being flat out weird . sure , there are plenty of plot holes , reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award ... ..however the plot is very interesting ( again filled with tons of holes ) but i watch a movie to be entertained , not to be a film critic or to analyze everything . overall , if you like weird movies like `` fear and loathing in las vegas '' this movie is for you , if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how `` true to life '' it may or may not be ... ..well just skip this one
1	gibson and weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in indonesia . they start living the expat life in jakarta , and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule . the movie is interesting on many fronts : seeing the leads before they became megastars , watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals , and the history woven into the fiction . supporting roles are played superbly as well . it 's a great movie
0	ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie , i was estatic . i marked the movie release date on my calander , got my tickets in advance , and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater . the movie was a huge dissapointment . while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book , i certainly was n't expecting that . while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie , i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book . the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth . i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie , it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears , despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times
0	reality bites seemed fresh when it was first released , giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of `` x '' - that was overeducated , underemployed , plagued by the flashy , trashy commercialism of mtv , and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college . it was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass , cruel arena of materialism can be tough , providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies . instead we have a swan dive into a pizza hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930 . winona ryder is winning as lelaina , but one can only imagine the sats of football players at a college where she is valedictorian . her `` documentary '' is appallingly narcissistic , reflecting the characteristic gen x notion that - `` if it 's about me , it 's art , and it 's important . '' ethan hawke does an excellent job as troy , the very archetype of self-satisfied , supercilious entitlement . we are expected to root for him , but it 's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus . stiller , who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays michael , the `` anti-troy . '' smooth , successful , and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of gen x culture - if culture is the right word - he 's an executive at an mtv-ish corporation . that he improves lelaina 's preposterous `` documentary , '' rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity , is the film 's dirty little secret . viewers surprised by who wins lelaina 's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and liberace was gay . indeed , when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie . janeane garofalo is outstanding as always , and john mahoney shines as the tv morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact , a bastard . his performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on tv - than the rest of this film put together . in fact , reality is great , this picture would have benefited from some
0	this must have seemed like a great idea at the time , '' cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor '' . the problem is his range is all the way from a to b. this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many `` chance '' happenings . in the end all we get is this `` thriller '' ( and i use the term very loosely ) that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling
1	most of us have seen the movie , a great drama with great acting . the dvd is a super clean transfer . not any features to speak of but well worth the money invested . very clean for a movie made so many years ago . mann
0	an english teacher 's review . to my fellow educators : i have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of `` treasure island . '' i 've seen the version with charlton heston , the one with jack palance and the 1950 disney version . it is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of `` treasure island '' has apparently not yet been made , as all three were so abysmally bad that i was unable to finish them . what no director has yet come close to capturing , is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds , and the simple directness of stevenson 's 19th century morality tale . without exception , all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be ; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as wythe . again and again with each film , someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by stevenson apparently would n't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen . what i really want to know is if any of these directors actually read the book , or had a personal relationship with it ? i find it hard to believe that they did , since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is . jim hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn , when the captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of `` a seafaring man with one leg . '' the captain should be tall , mysterious , powerful and terrifying . in two of these films , he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos ; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director 's sister . it only gets worse from there . the tragedy of the captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the english oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum , terror and stroke . the captain 's fate - to fall dead of a `` thundering apoplexy '' on the floor of the inn , forshadows the essential purpose of stevenson 's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death . in the guise of a boy 's adventure story , stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power . his pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted . they are not caricatures . they are not the wax mannequins of a disney ride ; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts ; even with regrets . they do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it , gritting their teeth against the death , ( from violence , sickness , treachery or rum , ) that is always staring them in their faces . jim hawkins ' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates ' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust . it is no accident that , despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party , ( led by captain smollett , ) it is still only jim hawkins ' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from `` death at the hands of the pirates . '' stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to `` be like the little children in order to be saved . '' to tell this story properly , it must be told absolutely straight , and with the same committed earnestness with which stevenson tells it . none of these films is that brave . to make a film that is faithful to stevenson 's moral , the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined . those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice .
0	more predictable than an old tv land episode of bonanza and much less entertaining , this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons , one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system , one an idealist , and the middle son , tristan , played by brad pitt , a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature 's anger . at least that 's what i think he was doing . the fact is i never was a fan of this movie , not back in the 1990 's when my best friend loved it ( and predicted julia ormond would be a superstar -- sorry , gina , if you ever read this , i just could n't resist working that in there , ha-ha ) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing . i do n't think there 's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone . it 's not spectacular in its setting , it 's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story , and i found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring . to each his own , i know some love this movie , but from where i sit , this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
1	here 's an extremely stylish , different film panned by almost all the professional critics which means here 's another example of why they should be ignored . you are better off reading the reviews of people here at amazon . being one who appreciates stylish film-making , i thoroughly enjoyed the images and the sound on this movie . i found it absolutely fascinating . being a male , it does n't hurt that ashley judd stars in it , either . to be fair , i can see where the story would turn off a number of people.the co- lead , ewan mcgregory 's character , is odd and not very credible . k.d . lang 's character is unlikable , there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying . yet , despite the above , the story is very involving and the visuals and sound ( 5.1 surround ) are just so good that they way outweigh the negatives . the movie flat-out entertains , which is the name of the game .
1	do n't get me wrong ... i 'm as likely as anyone else looking for a `` chick flick '' to watch the latest meg ryan movie with the cute leading man ... .but this movie adds something extra . instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout ( girl guy meet , girl guy go through some conflict , but eventually guy girl get together and live happily ever after ) this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique , whether that relationship is between two friends , lovers , or family members . this movie is also great because it expounds upon the huge role that a person 's mind plays when it comes to love and sex . kate capshaw 's character , helen , is great for audience members who still have n't figured out that women are sexual beings and that it 's okay for them to enjoy sex ! ( even with a much younger man ! ) all the characters remind us that even though we may not have everything figured out , you can always learn some new tricks , no matter what your age . if you 're in the mood for mindless entertainment , i would n't recommend this movie . however , if you 're ready for a touching and romantic but still lighthearted flick , this is a good one !
0	i did not like this movie . i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity . nonetheless , i found it very disturbing : his lack of concern for his wife and children , how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional , and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have `` a bit on the side . '' and what about her kids ? apart from the first scene we never see them again ; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man . i 'm not a prude , really , but this film left a bad taste in my mouth
0	this is the worst holiday movie in america ! i mean if you buy this product you 'll face torture ( as in singing horribly . ) making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief . they also said that `` if you want , wish for fairy tales and it will come true . '' right . some fairy tales are gruesome ( for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off . ) eeww ! the voice talents are very annoying . better save your money when you buy a christmas movie
0	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved . i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse . jet li was pretty good , but how the hell do you screw that up . tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie , but it still turns out horribley . i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad , but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse
0	if you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession , gloomy ( and very well done ) night photography , the occasional graphic sex scene , and metaphors so obvious even a high school film class could catch them , then this just might be your cup of tea . howewver , if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject , then you are out of luck . to be fair , portugese director joão pedro rodrigues has made some daring choices here . dialogue is minimal -- this might as well be a silent film with sound effects . he 's working one of the great themes -- the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary . there is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions . and yes , there is more than a little boundage mixed in . ( this is no 50s mgm musical . ) it looks good -- night photography , lots of backlight and black surfaces , either dull or glittering . sergio ( played by ricardo meneses , a garbageman in lisbon , drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer ( and sergio is pretty hunky himself ) . while not obsessing , he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another . finally , he goes off the beam completely ( i wo n't go into all the details in case you decide to see it ) . the problem is the same that so many self-consciously arty films , from greed to the unbearable lightness of being , share -- their metaphors are too obvious ( here , among others , it 's human and animal behavior -- sergio 's best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically ) and they are just too long . o fantasma would make a pretty good 40 minutes festival film -- at 90 minutes , it just drags , particularly the ending with sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit . ( come to think of it , kind of an echo of the equally tedious final sequence of greed . ) i admit it -- i really have n't the patience for films that scream out how artful they are and have little or nothing except style , attitude , and angst . style and attitude -- think fred astaire -- can be a winning combination . unfortunately , in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria , this is not a winning film . basically , it 's a bore
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	i think it 's kind of poetic that i ended up getting the film adaption of ray bradbury 's `` fahrenheit 451 '' . it was because i could n't find the book anywhere ! i do n't know how good it is as an adaption , but i found the film thought provoking , well directed and clever . the film is set in a world where books are banned and burnt . nothing is to be read , except for the numbers on top of the bottles of pills and sedatives people of this age often take . books have contradicting ideas , the book burning `` firemen '' claim . they make people unhappy sometimes , they change people . authors are raised on high in the world of literature , as if they are more than the people around them . for a happier society , where everyone can be equal , books must be destroyed , they say . montag is a fireman , a talented one due for a promotion . he has a wife , he has a large television set in the wall ( though most people in this world have two ) , and he considers himself a pretty happy guy . a young woman approaches him on the monorail home , having seen him around for so long on the trip home she felt she should say hello . she asks about his job , and wonders if he ever read any of the books he burnt . it gets him thinking , and he ends up reading a copy of david copperfield by charles dickens that is due to be torched . like the firemen say , it changes his life , and suddenly this happy society seems a little more sinister than before ... i think it 's a film that flows really well , has a couple of nice directorial quirks , and has that british 1960s feel in it 's sets , landscapes and colour schemes , which i always like . it 's kind of strange that it 's an english film , since ray bradbury , the author of the book is american . ah well . there 's a lot of ideas being toyed with here , the nature of memory , of knowledge , of oral traditions , of control . a lot to think about . definitely worth a look for sci-fi fans , i think
0	i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004 . i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie , but it was really lackluster . the acting is wooden , the script is very lame , and worst of all , the action is n't very exciting . i expected a much better movie from director richard donner . there is a battle scene , and there are action scenes , but they just are n't exciting . when the action is n't exciting , you better have a good story . the story here is alright , but certainly not enough to save the movie . i do n't hate any of the actors , they are decent when they have something to work with . here they had nothing to work with , so they obviously did n't do too well this time . this really is n't worth your time . i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it , and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there
0	being an oriental i am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours , although not as extensive as standard hollywood productions . with japanese films , whether it was made by a kurusawa or a more obscure artisan , i can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in pace , inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals , and are generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively substandard . village of dreams , while touted as an award winner is a glaring testimony of this stunted japanese film-making characteristic . review it yourself . the pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing . it was the same character that can be seen even in kurusawa 's ran - a `` highly acclaimed '' work that in my case , i could n't even view for the third time , because even its dvd resolution has a quality that can only be likened to the eye-view of a person who 's suffering his earliest stage of creeping glaucoma . village of dreams is so `` relaxed '' as if the filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they enjoyed in 1940s japan in an obscure countryside . at the very least , the straight narrative of this film is a consolation , but with ran , the actions were so hard to follow , you 'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking whom . the most unforgivable quality of this dvd transfer is the poor film stock . the picture approximates that of a `` third generation '' recording of a vhs copy . this means that you 'll be sorely dissapointed of having to get a vhs-quality copy copied , in turn , from another vhs copy which was copied from the original vhs `` master tape '' . of course , the dvd transfer is not at fault , its simply that the japanese despite their touted techno prowess just could n't give us a decent film stock , that could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems . the glaring deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious , when shown on high resolution tvs . i 've viewed this film in a 29-inch sony wega flat tv , and in a 50-inch mitsubishi projection tv , from a pioneer dvl 919 and 909 . if not for the antics of the two children leads , village comes off as wearisome . i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i 'm a film collector . its works like this that whets my appreciation for world cinema . unfortunately , village 's poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment , as well as negating its `` collectability '' factor . this should have looked more glorious if it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like what dreams may come or dark city , but of course that 's asking too much from those editing-challenged japanese filmakers . i want to ask amazon for a refund because this is not well worth its price value . i was compulsed to buy it because of its cover , i thought it was at least as exotically glorious-looking as kundun , but it proved to be just a small , obscure production . critics may raved about it , just like those canadians did with black robe , but the final word is that they 're just run of the mill , albeit thoughtful , films ... .
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made . i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies . they are either worse than this one ( rare ) or better than this one . as an example : buffalo '66 is worse . if you watch both in the same day , you will surely die
0	if you want uncut original version , always look for original licensed production . not us release . its a foreign film , it should not be us version to begin with~ ! hello ! ! ! ? ? why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie 's fighting scenes . and us release ruins the speed and sound as well.i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable , and higher in quality . american market always like to `` americanize '' and `` control '' . regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market . why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it ? ? no one makes hollywood american movies to `` french version '' or `` chinese version '' ~ ! this what americans are doing~ ! well , enjoy the cheap `` american version '' then~ ! lo
0	this movie must be restored -- the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with bloody mary 's singing bali hi . i tried to purchase a completely restored , digitally remastered dvd of this musical and could not find one in 2007 . i returned this dvd to the seller
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me

1	what an amazing concert . paul simon and a 17-piece backup band supported by a 10-piece brazilian percussion unit for all of the `` rhythm of the saints '' stuff . this is from 1991 , so the content is primarily derived from `` rhythm of the saints '' and `` graceland '' plus a smattering of the greatest of his earlier songs , and it 's live and energetic and beautiful and for crying out loud there 's seriously something like 750,000 people there . a crowd that big is usually reserved for , you know , the pope or somebody . it 's a stirring spectacle . fortunately , except for the occasional wide shot , the footage focuses mostly on the band , rather than on the most exuberant of simon enthusiasts mugging for the cameras . simon himself is not exactly mick jagger as far as stage presence goes , but his voice carries charisma in ways that wild stage theatrics could n't , and the rest of the band is hopping anyway so it does n't matter . simon 's weakness is his occasional tendency to drift towards lite , keyboard-based adult rock and that happens here a bit , but not nearly often enough to really complain about . the emotional climaxes of this show are a massive percussive jam session at the end of `` diamonds on the souls of her shoes '' and stripped-down , powerfully moving renditions of `` america '' and `` the boxer , '' which draw wild cheers from the central park crowd at every passing reference to new york . while there is also a cd of this concert available ( a very good one , i should add ) , audio alone can not capture the raw excitement of the accordion opening to `` the boy in the bubble . '' this is a concert for the ages
1	this is , by far , the best `` beginners '' video i have ever done . i am a huge fan of the firm workouts ; their approach is based on science , they have a diverse selection ( i own over 30 firm videos and dvds ) , their instructors know what they 're doing , and most of all , they work . these workouts , combined with the sensible firm eating plan ( it is not a diet , but a practical plan based on the food pyramid ) helped me quit smoking without gaining a pound ... in fact , i lost weight and was in the best shape of my life . now that i 'm planning to quit again , these videos are the first things i 'm pulling out of my `` toolbox . '' tracy long is one of the best instructors the firm had ; she gives excellent demonstration and information regarding form and `` how to 's , '' and i find her quiet style preferable to hyper cheerleader types . she remains a great inspiration for me
0	looking for a really good thriller , i spotted `` fascination , '' with jacqueline bisset and was sure that with her and the cast , my husband and i had found the perfect summer film on dvd . what a disappointment . although bisset rallies to the role , the same can not be said of the other actors . the dialogue is painfully inept at conveying anything in the least bit sexy , provocative or psychologically intriguing . the cloying , saccharine musical score does n't help . whereas the music in `` the swimming pool , '' or `` the wide sargasso sea , '' enhances , heightens the dramatic intensity , mystery and sensuality , the musak in `` fascination , '' undermines whatever potential drama there might be . the characters other than bisset and her unfortunate first husband seem too infatuated with themselves to be erotically convincing . as an ensemble cast , they seem indifferent to both the story and their audience . magnificent bodies and sexy entanglements are not enough , in my opinion , to compensate for the pedestrian acting and rather predictable plot . jacqueline bisset deserves better and so do we viewers .

1	if you played any of the pc/video games than you know how much they left out of this movie . still , its one of the best `` b '' movies i 've ever bought . i enjoy it every time i watch it
0	... and i can remember some of the scenes to this day ( i 'm 49 now ) . i was 16 ; my friend,17 at the time . i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days , and after that movie , i didn't-for a long time . at the time it was a really scary film , and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story , which only added to the starkness of it . of course , as some have opined here , what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas . `` horror-and-brutality technology '' in films has definitely-and i use this word wryly-evolved
0	i have rented this video for the sake of a trip down memory lane . of course , fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility . i hated this video for its teaching of american ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable . for example , in
1	great movie ! pretty funny , and it has a wonderful moral to it , but i wo n't give it away ! watch the movie ! you 'll love it
0	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it
0	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film . if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie .
0	i might be in a slightly foul mood on account of my having just returned from a shopping experience which resulted in my receiving a parking ticket , but ... i used to watch kb 's hamlet on a fairly regular basis . whether is was on cable or vhs , i found i could never get enough . i signed the petition . i 'm one of those people who 's written letters in the hopes they 'll actually make a difference . that said , where is the frikkin ' dvd ? i mean , has anybody else noticed that kb 's hamlet has already missed the dvd boat ? while the world is moving toward hd-dvd , we *still* have yet to see a sign of the stupid thing . i have n't owned a vcr since back before amazon even really existed , or was , at least , widely known ( i was an early adopter of dvd ) . now , years later - *years* after the first time i inquired about this release , i still ca n't believe it is n't out . reality check , people : forbidden planet , fine movie though it may have been ( and in context of this discussion as , beneath its sci-fi exterior , one can find an interesting retelling of the tempest ) , it 's gone from film ( decades before i was born ) to vhs/beta/ ? , to dvd , and now to hd-dvd . why is it that a film like forbidden frikkin ' planet gets pushed up through the years and transferred over and over again to the latest medium when *the* finest version of hamlet ever produced for the screen has been left behind ? what 's going on ? is kb being held at gunpoint by mel gibson 's handlers ? is there blackmail involved ? did kb contract george lucas to add a bunch of cgi ewoks to each scene ? 'cause i ca n't figure out , for the life of me , why we have n't seen this stupid thing yet . was it that hard to commit it to vhs ? it seems to me that it was readily and easily done . so what 's the deal with dvd ? is the money just not good enough , mr. branagh ? i realize that your talents lie in theater rather than finances , but 100 % of zero is zero . it makes me wonder , then ... is it some artistic issue ? when transferred to the higher fidelity formats of dvd and hd-dvd , are there imperfections present that were undetectable when the film was out in vhs format ? can we see more clearly how charleton heston 's weird teeth have yellowed and browned over the years and formed into this strange rolling dental pattern greatly in need of modern dentistry ( my dentist could set those teeth painlessly over a four month period without the use of orthodontics ) ? for years , i 've wondered about this . college came and went . i 've moved to three different continents . my own career has gone from peon to mr. importantpants , and yet *we are still without even a dvd version of hamlet* . yes , i realize there 's a 4:3 version of the film available for digitital download , but please do n't make me any more uppity than i already am . i want the film , and i want it in its full glory , with proper aspect ratio , and preferably on hd-dvd so i can see it in all its glory ( which would be especially nice considering the 70mm film used to record this sucker ) . i hate to give what is easily the best film version of hamlet ever produced ( and , no , this point is not open to argument - it 's not an opinion , but , rather , a scientifically proven fact ) one star , but given that the man and his peeps have had over a *decade* to get the job done , i think it 's really just about time to see it hitting store shelves . if it *is* hitting shelves , by the by , i apologize for the rant , but i 'm tired of waiting . i want to see this movie on a disc before i die . widescreen . preferably hd . i do n't care about the bonus materials - you can keep 'em if *that's* what 's taking so long . but just get some dummy college intern to do the transfer and throw together a dvd menu . if it can be done for forbidden planet , then it can be done for hamlet . i have spoken . and i am awesome
0	my 14 month old son loves the baby einstein series . they 've been the only movies to hold his attention . the sounds and music get his attention , the shapes and colors hold it . that said , this movie never got or held his attention . there are no interesting sounds or music . the voices are very monotone . while i understand the intention of this video , if you do n't catch the attention of the child , what 's the worth in it ? the pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said . i also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages , but foreign cultures . if i knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited , i could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool . all around , this move was disappointing
1	ha ! great movie , plot , performances and insights ! got ta see this one , at least once , for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece . my main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society . those who ca n't , do n't or wo n't appreciate ( at least ) the marvelous , insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much . scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity 's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power , control and coveting ; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man 's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance . it is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain , as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself , even with all his knowledge and tech , to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of ( so called ) lower species . have some fun and enjoy this movie . it is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels . as a species , we have come so far and grown so little ! this movie will make you ( oh-oh ) think and feel about subliminal and covert topics o human nature that are rarely put well in words or illustrated in today 's world .
0	this movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other . when does that ever happen ? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids . what 12 yr. old worries about `` ..never getting out of this small town. '' ? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends , then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense . i have a feeling oprah would like this movie .
1	wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember . but still a great movie , especially with the deleted scenes . they are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old . but still allot of fun to watch
1	picture this : clark gable and the whole passle of mgm stars and starlets ! spins a great story , and all this in 1947 , could be today , except they dressed better . you will not forget the characterizations , especially sydney greenstreet , eat your heart out eddie murphy , just a marvy little film for all ages ( god i love cliches !
1	this is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about . it is about laughs . it is a comedy that takes place in the old west . mel gibson plays a professional gambler , brett maverick , who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament . the entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars . he has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him , always with hilarious results . as he makes his way towards to tournament , he encounters another gambler , played by jodie foster , who also wants to enter the tournament . she too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket . the final main character is the us marshall played by james garner . he does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well . he has been hired to provide security . as they make their way to the big event , all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others . the indians get involved and come across as the funniest , most honest and most intelligent people around . they finally get maverick his stake ( with lots of laughs ) and the stage is set for the big tournament . the tournament itself is full of laughs , surprises , twists and turns . it also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars . all of this is fun but the interplay between gibson , foster and garner is the real fun . get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing .
0	anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft . in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the `` best '' scenes if you get my drift . if you want to see the original film this is not it . avoid at all costs
1	great movie and musical numbers courtesy of quincy jones and the wonderful cast .
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
0	i hate lawyers . what is a lawyer , anyway ? basically : it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit , a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco hair-in-a-can super-duper late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset , only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb . shakespeare said it first and best : `` first , let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' . former enron uber-dealmaker john wing put a little fast-times houston spin on that one : `` get all the lawyers in a room -- -and shoot 'em ! -- -in the mouth , so you *can't* miss ! '' exactly . anyway , `` the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting , so i was probably all amped up to despise it . but not really : back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance , back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater , i briefly considered going into law : briefly , for about an hour . it was a desperate time , and i needed money . why did i consider walking hell 's highway , if only for an instant ? because john grisham , boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer , a kind of tom clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set , made it all sound pretty damned funky ( and lucrative ! hey , dig that bmw 7 series , baby , beep beep ! ) in his engrossing little novel `` the firm '' : granted , i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes , but it held my attention . i mean , seriously : you 're 19 , and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool . and strippers , man , plenty of strippers . oh , and did someone mention a bmw ? what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake ? the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a** . now it 's true : grisham writes like kim jong il sings , but -- -in `` the firm '' , anyway -- -he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace , from the pedestrian -- -hotshot law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis white-shoe law firm -- -to the pretty damned atrocious , all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense , suffocating sense of malice . grisham , like michael crichton , is n't a prose genius : he 's not even mediocre . but he writes for film , and `` the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment . so it 's baffling that , with all the right stuff -- -tom cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere , gene hackman doing his chain-drinking gene hackman thang as the corrupt ( but ultimately worn-out and pathetic ) senior partner , and sydney pollack helming it up -- -that the big-screen treatment of `` the firm '' is such a yawner . talk about contempt of court . pollack takes all that intricately woven little grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen . at its guts , really , `` the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare : i 've bet the farm on this gig , i 'm getting big money , i 'm working like a fiend , my wife is having trouble remembering my name , and evidently i 'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients -- -i 'm doing money laundering for the mob . pollack just mangles the whole thing , convolutes the simple , and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning . casting is part of the problem : cruise does his thing , running around memphis with his briefcase . hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure armani-clad sleaze : `` the firm '' is all funny-wrinkles when he 's onscreen , but hey , a man can only do so much . jeanne tripplehorn ( cruise 's squeeze ) , who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn ( seriously , google the two of 'em : astounding ! ) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes . wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief : too bald , too cracker , too rotund , too silly , too low-end , to do the role justice . holly hunter is even worse : hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy , which is baffling , given that she 's about 3'8 , and has all the sex appeal of an oompah-loompah . it does n't help that she 's a big , ugly southern stereotype , the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be . you want her to die : she does n't . pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny . she is n't . ed harris , i think , is in this movie . so is hal holbrook , which kinda ruins everything , because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks . anyway , the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance , deus ex machina , of paul sorvino ( don morolto -- -what kind of goombah name is dat , anyway ? somebody call tony soprano ! ) , who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous . if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours , by all means belly up to the bar . otherwise , case dismissed . js
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	i have three fugitives on laserdisc and i bought the dvd too , a must see for martin short 's fans :
0	i too bought this on vhs for vincent d'onofrio . my only negative comment about his performance is that there 's not enough of it ! i 'll say right here and now that i 'm not a big fan of smits or scacchi , and d'onofrio overpowers them every time he 's on screen . it 's a beautiful story , and i can see why director gillian armstrong was attracted to it - it is a love story with a bit of real-life depth ( rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination - julia roberts films , anyone ? ) . that being said , the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors , and ones that could keep up with d'onofrio vivacity . worth a look for fans

1	it 's right on . the scene transitions are nicely done . even though a lot of this is predictable , it is still funny and makes one eager to see what 's ' next . fernando literally goes down the line of all the sisters , till he has a shot gun wedding with the last . the scene between the cuckold and the err ... cuckolded cuckold is hilarious . the sisters are very vivid and pretty ( well except that cruz girl ) . overall a very brilliantly done story
0	it 's a so-so film with rourke in the ira . some good stuff . look for anthony ( stewart head ) as rupert ( note : anthony stewart head portraits another rupert ... rupert giles on the tv show buffy the vampire slayer ) so , now you know . but this one is so-so like i sai
1	despite it 's cover `` strangeland '' is not your typical horror movie . the violence and mutilation are certainly here but the story behind it is the true heart of the tale . i would not reccommend this for the squeamish or for children under 12
1	cannes man was funny . i do n't know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster , but it made me laugh out loud . just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland , and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who do n't know their **s from a hole in the ground
1	i highly recommend this dvd for its superior acting - all hands , as well as for the spectacular photography , scenery and overall quality of presentation . a real keeper
0	this movie is the most frightening film i 've tried to watch with my [ ... ] daughter . it is not suitable for very young children . i was rather horrified by just how creepy it is . the juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary `` spirit '' is truly bizarre and could ; ve been created by someone who in fact hates children . if you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80 's , but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children , be forewarned . this movie is not only bad , it 's kinda 'bad ' . like , not in a good way . if children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80 's or getting some really weird gift for a friend , then , you know , maybe you 'll dig it . i did n't
0	the `` urban legend '' franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years . i just do n't understand why this movie was made . it shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus . the film is pretty bad . i 'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it does n't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre . the acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because kate mara is in the cast . she delivered some pretty good roles in `` nip/tuck '' and `` jack bobby '' but she goes through this movie , along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth . it 's hard to care about the characters at all . they just float around with seemingly no purpose . i even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan i am , i had to continue . there is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star . it involves a pretty girl and a spider . most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies . the film even has a cameo scene from `` final cut '' in which a character is watching a porn on the tv . overall , not even worth a rental . luckily for me , i did n't have to waste 3 bucks because it was available for free on my comcast on demand .

1	the first edition of do n't look back was the first dvd i ever bought and i bought a dvd player the same day . it is an execellent example of the power and pitfalls of `` cinema verite/direct cinema '' , a style emerging in the 1960s made possible by lightweight sound sync cameras and recorders , zoom lenses , and fast film stock . the `` who threw the f -- glass '' altercation followed by the cruel juxtoposition of donovon offering `` song for you '' to which dylan responds with a smirk and `` it 's all over now baby blue '' is one of the great passages in documentary film . you may love or hate dylan 's music and after watching the film , you are n't left with any illusions about him being a nice person . but he is a force of nature . lyrics poured through him , some timely , some timeless , raw ones and delicate ones . for me he was always better on recordings than in person , and the film reminds me why . but i 'm glad to have this glimpse of the artist . i do n't know about the `` deluxe edition '' . it may be worth it for the higher quality telecine transfer . the original film does not need amplification . it reveals more about dylan than the bloated `` no direction home '' that used so much of the same footage
0	zed ( sean connery ) hitches a ride inside of a giant , flying , stone head . once aboard , he shoots it 's occupant dead and flies off to `` the vortex '' , a place where the `` eternals '' live . this is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about . they just loll around , musing and pontificating about nothing . zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and , oh yeah , by having a male organ that works ! i kid you not ! the rest is mainly zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull . unfortunately , so is this movie ! john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur ) wrote , produced , and directed this elephant tranquilizer . although , it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..
1	i saw this on tv and loved it , so i had to buy it
1	i love this film . everyone must see it , at least once . just as everyone should taste ice cream or smell a bouquet of fresh lilies-of-the-valley , or fall in love ... ya got ta see this . `` la strada '' is part of a body of work that has , at its core , a thread of autobiographical sentiment so powerful and mysterious , that scholars are still dissecting his films frame by frame . although fellini says , in the criterion collection dvd `` extra '' `` i have no message for humanity ... i am sorry '' , we still believe that if we can decode the images , stories , fantasies and dreams of fellini 's experience/imagination , we will find profound truths . certainly , the experience of viewing a fellini film has proven to be worthwhile to a vast audience across geographic , linguistic and cultural boundaries , and over time . there 's something to this fellini guy 's stuff ... but what the heck is it ? i think fellini 's films are distillations of beauty , humor , dreams , pathos , nightmares and the pleasure and pain of living . when fellini insists that he does n't have a message , he is probably right . he 's not trying to sell ideas . he is only trying to give form to his thoughts and dreams and nightmares and fantasies and experiences and memories . the result is something we would call `` art '' . for those of us susceptible to the aesthetic , fellini is a master . la strada is a film with a `` neorealist '' core . the ravaged countryside , the long , lonely vistas of fields , the sea , and the faces of poverty belong in large part to the `` neorealist '' post-war films that look unflinchingly at harsh realities of a war-torn italy . the circus , which here forms an environment , is the backdrop for individuals who reveal their characters in a tragic landscape.reading the film artist 's biography `` fellini on fellini '' reveals his attitude toward the `` auguste '' clown '' and the imperious `` white clown '' , their relationships , power structures , and the circus as a metaphor for life itself . in `` 8 1/2 '' , the film-maker concludes with an acceptance of life as a circus- a parade of clowns , lovers , friends and associates who enter the spotlight and give resolution to the film . who is to argue ? i think life is like a circus pretty often.there is the reality of being `` in '' the circus and behind the illusions and there is the reality of being an `` observor '' and outside . flip this into any social situation and watch it fit . we develop compassion and sympathy for the main characters . giulietta massina is luminous as the female protagonist clown-a kind of `` auguste '' figure ( according to fellini 's own breakdown of character types ) . she is the butt of jokes , is the lost soul , the sidekick to the `` white clown '' , and the hapless , confused child . anthony quinn is oh-so-dark as zampano , the strongman ( a kind of `` white clown '' authority figure ) who blusters , bosses , bullies and frightens . in the end of the film , a man cries at the edge of the sea . he is broken , lost , has betrayed the trust of an innocent , has little reason to believe his own soul may be saved ... except for the fact that his tears are falling . his recognition of the sanctity of life comes late .
1	i have had this movie on vhs for quite some time and just recently purchased the dvd . this movie tells a great story while revealing l amor 's view of the range cowboys morality . there simply are not enough good westerns being made anymore . this is a great western . i would highly recomend any western that is derived from a louis l amor novel
1	funny that someone would produce a `` chick flick '' based on the relationship of novalyne price to author robert e. howard , creator of the sci-fi/fantasy character conan . no doubt someone in hollywood thought the irony of filming a romantic character study of the man who wrote the classic male-oriented action-thriller stories of the 1930s would be a good way to attract an unlikely mix of female romance fans and fans of the conan books and comics . well the ploy worked , as i got my husband ( severely allergic to chick flicks ) to sit down and watch this one with me . `` you probably wo n't like this , '' i said , `` but it does show two creative people , one of them is the guy [ robert e. howard ] who wrote the conan books . '' vincent d'onofrio plays robert e. howard , a man who simultaneously looks sympathetic and psychopathic ( his portrayal of private pyle in `` full metal jacket '' is one of film history 's creepiest moments ) . that he actually resembles howard as a bonus . timeless beauty rene zellweger plays the intelligent price , a local texas school teacher who becomes romantically interested in howard , a recluse that types his stories with extreme intensity in the privacy of his home while taking care of an ailing mother . my favorite scene is the one where where renee 's character is demonstrating how much she appreciates language in its ability to describe the scenery around them . robert e. howard 's response boils down to , `` that 's great , but what the hell happens ? '' and he begins imagining an exciting adolescent heroic fantasy intruding into her peaceful meadow . the scene almost makes you feel guilty for realizing that there are real reasons why conan and other pulp fiction characters endure and outsell all but the very best of the more respectable stuff . the film , as my brother ( another howard fan , who named his dog after conan ) notes , also did n't shy away from the fact that most of the best pulp work was based on insecure power trips written by and for arrested adolescents with real issues . here is the difficulty howard fans , such as my husband , who has written reams of what he has written , will have with the film . the story is told from his girlfriend novalyn 's perspective so a very important aspect of howard 's life , the specifics and depth of his stories , is largely skimmed over . the film sums up howard 's work by showing price in a witty scene comparing her breast size with the bosoms of howard 's characters , and by showing the shock of people as he describes or acts out his work in public . there is some attempt at showing his desire to create the deeper more assertive female character valeria in `` red nails '' but it is only a passing mention in conversation . howard is depicted as resting on the edge of insanity at times , which is believable considering his tragic end . he does n't just write , he becomes his characters . price , an aspiring writer herself , hopes to learn from howard but is put off by his erratic behavior and a more romantic interest in him that wishes he 'd write nicer stories with more pleasant sympathetic characters . this void between them prevents the viewers ... or should i say howard fans from knowing which stories he was working on at what time in the plot . `` the devil in iron '' is the only one mentioned by name and others are hinted at including a boxing story , `` queen of the black coast , '' and his last masterpiece `` red nails , '' which many fans regard as his finest story ( or yarn as robert calls them in the film ) . as my husband has read all of his books and many different comic adaptations he was able to pick out some of the works from his ramblings behind the typewriter , but his work is treated as a distracting sideshow by the film , in spite of the price character 's attempts to be non-judgmental and open-minded about his topics . the real story of the film is a battle between price and howard 's mother for his attention . this may be an accurate dramatization of price 's feelings but to a howard fan its a little bit like treating michaelangelo 's david or the sistine chapel as incidental in the story of his life . a talented artist will live their work , become their characters , the events will be in their heads almost as if it is reality . the work is hardly incidental , it is their life . the film dramatizes this but omits the actual stories . to sum it up , `` the whole wide world '' is an engaging romance that will keep the attention of both men and women watching at home , but in the end may disappoint howard fans ( but not too much ) . my husband has stacked five of his conan paperbacks by my desk for me to read , all as a result of making him watch this dvd with me . by the way , if you are wondering about the title , it 's based on howard shouting to novalyn that he wants to be the best writer `` in the whole wide world .
1	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best . when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window . i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays
0	it is unfortunate that the only video presentation of amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production . it is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in ms. lynch 's review . true , ms. stratas ' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra , but there were also moments when her diction was less than perfect , during times which the orchestra had , gratefully , been relegated to a less prominent decibel level . here , sound production staff must share blame . menotti knew what he was writing . a brilliant orchestrator , he etched clearly , the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures . staging , at times , appears to have little to do with the music . when one thinks of menotti and opera ( almost synonymous ) , the marriage of music and theatre is considered a perfect union . sadly , menotti 's obvious musical intentions were overlooked . it is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced . i would disagree with ms. lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work . the beginning , the introduction makes the strongest impression . it is lasting . this is one indelibility i would not welcome
0	one of the worst movies ever this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed
0	michael moore can be really funny at times , but most people should not take this goofball too seriously . about half way through 'the big one ' , i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going . what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick ? this is not one of his better films
0	yes , i must admit that i was fooled by the `` one of the most notorious , most debated , most banned films of the 'video nasty ' era . '' line on this back of this movie case . i was lucky because i found this at a best buy for $ 10.99 . it should be $ 2.99 for as bad as it is . i 've been let down by these italian horror films one too many times . if you want good , gore filled , italian horror stick with lucio fulci or dario argento . once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they 're berrible . oh , by the way , unless you are fluent in italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have english subtitles . the only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language
0	i read this book for a project two years ago . i was n't about to finish this book and had to move to another one . first off , this book lacks emotion . this character is so boring . she does n't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me , a book without emotion is just unreadable . i hated this book , but i do n't like most scott o'dell books . just go read another book
0	if i ever : a ) subject myself to this movie ever again or b ) subject anyone else ( including animals ) to this movie form a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review . just one question that still haunts me ... how does travolta 's career survive this debacle and pepper 's hits the tank ?
0	simply not enough of amy weber in the film . in the scenes she was in she looked lovely , but i was hoping to see more . anyone hoping to see weber get down and dirty will be disappointed
1	i first saw this movie on satellite tv with my mom one winter vacation . recently , i was reminded of it , and remembered how wonderful it is . besides being an adorable story , the film is shot beautifully in black and white , which the dvd shows off perfectly . i think it 's much better than you 've got mail , although i like that movie , too . definitely worth at least a rental
1	vanilla sky is either a disappointment when viewed against indie film standards , or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded hollywood that 's released weekly . on the plus side , we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind . a movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting , it is that rare commodity : the movie we like to talk about later . like memento or barton fink , people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it 's over . also impressive is the fact that tom cruise , one of hollywood 's famed pretty boys , spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask , or horribly disfigured . not a role many other actors would jump to take . on the down side , vanilla sky , ( a re-make ? ) is basically an art house or indie film starring a big hollywood actor . what could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man , or alternate/multiple realities , or even a study on the nature of reality itself , instead ends up like an art house rip-off of total recall . rating : b- / c+ fyi : 1 ) when did the universe change so much that `` banky '' from chasing amy could get a lead role playing opposite tom cruise ? 2 ) when did penelope cruz get the role of indecipherable speaker , ala brad pitt in snatch or fenster in the usual suspects ? 3 ) when did paul mccartney last have a decent single ? here , with the title track
0	when i first saw the previews , i thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie ... of course , i thought the same about white noise . i guess the lesson here is that hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end ( like the sixth sense ) . i think hollywood is more interested in making a good trailer than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office . the forgotten is no exception . the first half an hour or so is very good and joseph ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from julianne moore and dominic west . however , the movie quickly begins to fall apart ( like white noise ) and becomes less and less believable . i was hoping for a logical explanation , especially since the box of the movie read : `` the biggest jaw-dropper since the sixth sense . '' however , the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was . nothing at all like when the ending came for sixth sense . i bought this movie for $ 2 so i ca n't complain but so much , but am still amazed at hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining , cohesive movie without so many holes . the only thing that is `` forgotten '' is i have forgotten when creepy , psychological movies were good
0	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it . it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time . if you thought she was bad in scream ... and friends..dont watch this ... there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it . hopefully this show will be scraped
1	it is definatly a total 80 's movie ! packed full of cheesy music and themes ! but i love it ! teen witch is a feel good movie about being okay with being different ! got ta love that
0	just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it . the first movie i ever walked out of , and i was home ! ! ! ! the pits ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels . up to this time i had never heard of it , but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing . as i continued to watch ( it had english subtitles fortunately ) i became enthralled by the acting , plot and historical theme . with a little detective work , i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes . i told my wife how good it was , and after we watched an episode together , she and i both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it . we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television . nearly every episode was better than 90 % of the hollywood movies out there . if you like , action , drama , amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors , intersting history , and some of the best writing i have seen on television , or anywhere for that matter , check this out
1	nobody is safe from satire , not even alfred hitchcock . but mel brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in `` high anxiety , '' a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of hitch films -- while keeping in brooks ' trademark slapstick , hilarious dialogue , and weird characters . dr. richard thorndyke ( brooks ) has just been hired as the director of psychoneurotic institute for the very , very nervous , after the sudden death of the previous administrator . something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard , a patient signals thorndyke with a mirror , and dr. charles montague ( harvey korman ) frightens a patient into fits . then one of the doctors dies mysteriously , while trying to leave the conspiracy . and when thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention , the evil nurse diesel ( cloris leachman ) sends a hired killer ( wearing a thorndyke mask ) to frame the doctor for murder . now thorndyke must elude the police and the killer , clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress ( madeleine kahn ) , and overcome his crippling `` high anxiety . '' as a homage/spoof , this is gold . brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various hitchock movies , including `` vertigo '' and `` spellbound , '' with some nods to `` psycho , '' `` north by northwest '' and `` the birds . '' there 's dizzying looks down a wooden tower , newspaper `` stabbings '' in the shower , and madeleine kahn 's strange not-so-icy blonde . but it 's also a great movie in its own right . rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies , brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices . for example , thorndyke 's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from ... `` a mr . mcguffin . '' and he fills it with hysterical comedic situations , like victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert , or thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy . and his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one ( `` those who are tardy do not get fruit cup '' ) . the highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song , where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad `` if you love me tell me loud loud loud . '' gene wilder was n't available when this was made , so brooks took the lead himself . the seriousness of the character does n't entirely fit him , but he 's a solid enough thorndyke , especially when he has to give a g-rated speech about penis envy . most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde madeleine kahn as the chic love interest , as well as a ghoulish leachman and s enthusiastic korman ( `` too much bondage , too much bondage , not enough discipline ! '' ) . and ron carey and howard morris round the cast off , as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little german shrink . `` high anxiety '' is an affectionate parody/homage to hitchcock -- even hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it 's also a solid comedy movie . definitely worth seeing ! ( stalking , r-hag ?
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	blech ! i really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute . wrong ! it was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were . the only redeeming actor was justin long . the rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells
1	i had previously seen wong kar wai 's two most recent full-length films ( in the mood for love and 2046 ) and enjoyed them greatly . i just recently purchased the rest of his catalogue and have been viewing them in chronological order . tonight i watched chungking express . this film , like all of his films , deals with isolation , loss , and missed connections . it contains two separate stories which , on the surface , are not related . the first story i found to be intriguing though not really so inspiring . the second ( which comprises the bulk of the film ) was simply amazing ! wkw really has a way of placing you into the emotions of his characters ! his is an extremely voyeuristic style to film-making . as the story progressed i started to feel uncomfortable as a result of one of the characters ' behavior . then the discomfort gave way to exuberance and i was smiling and even laughing along with this character . i began to sympathize and ( god forbid ! ) even condone what was happening . when the character 's game came to an end ( as it had to do ) i was scared for her but was relieved when her victim ( ? ) also sympathized and condoned her behavior . then , the story took a turn and it broke my heart in a most profound way . wkw 's stories always break my heart , but this one really hurt in a more personal way ! i 'm not really sure why . but after all the sadness and pain , this story turned around and put the pieces back together ! beware ! this is not a film for mainstream junkies ! if you enjoy challenging and thought-provoking movies , then this is a definite must-see ! if you have primarily subsisted on a diet of mainstream hollywood fare but are curious to see the treasures that are possible with daring film-making , then this movie is an excellent gateway drug
1	this is my favorite film of all time ! i am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it - it was an acadamy award winner , so i do n't understand why it 's not gotten much attention over the years ... i find it superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than captains courageous . i do n't know why this is the case , but i am it 's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it ... it is a wonderful and moving story , that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as `` it 's a wonderful life does '' ... if you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you ! do not miss it

1	this is by far one of the very best musicals ever made . kathryn grayson and howard keel displays oscar worthy performances as lilli and fred . sadly , this was grayson`s last mgm film and she did only 1 more ( at paramount - the vagabond king with oreste ) . in kiss me kate she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through . audrey hepburn won that year`s oscar for roman holiday - but miss grayson should deservedly have won it . the same goes for howard keel . true , he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives ( mind u - he was a musical star ) . william wolden`s oscar for stalag 17 should have gone to mr keel . that`s entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer arthur freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny . yet you shouldn`t negletct jack cummings who produced this film , seven brides for seven brothers and three little words ( to name but a few ) . it seems to me that mgm had an `` mgm-look ! '' can u really tell the mgm films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director ? not really , unless u are hitchcock or fritz lang . what i mean to say that it`s high time cummings , joe pasternak og sol c. sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts ( bathing beauty , anchors aweigh , in the good old summertime , summer stock , the great caruso , hit the deck and high society etc ) . i must also pay may respects to tommy rall ( soon 2 be one of the brothers in seven brides for seven brothers ) ; he is a dancer`s dream come true : -
1	excellent price , speed of delivery , and quality . i am very happy with this purchase
0	there 's a reason why they talk about the `` voice of an angel '' -- it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one . her acting debut `` i 'll be there '' is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out of sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert . fast forward to the present : kerr discovers that unknown to him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth to a daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who is now a well-adjusted paper girl . the problem is , olivia has been kept a secret from her dad . rebecca is embittered , but kerr wants to get to know his daughter , and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father . music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together , but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps . `` i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler , who , despite being only in her twenties , has had an immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she will get a biopic , because `` i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way : it involves a rock star and his daughter . otherwise , it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting . with a forgettable script , not much humor and a goofy premise , the movie does n't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy , scripted for church to act out . and not a terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest ; it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills . the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet . as for acting talent , she is bland at best , but she does perform some good songs , and her voice is as pretty as ever . just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave does as good a job as she can , and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker . his is the only memorable role in the film , and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church . miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the britney spears approach . `` i 'll be there , '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can
1	this movie is a must have for all family libraries . it appeals to adults and youth alike . a true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside , no matter what our outward differences are . really teaches the lesson , `` do n't judge a book by its cover '' .

0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	this 1948 15-chapter serial features superman [ played here by the late kirk alyn ] going up against a gang of crooks . this is a hell of a lot better than the 1950s tv show that featured george reeves ! at least this serial was fun to watch and at least you can get into what 's going on in this movie . you might not be able to find this serial in stores today , but , if , by some chance , you come across this video , get it ! ! ! !

0	m. night shyamalan 's `` the sixth sense '' is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema . however , the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good . psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis ) returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children . a former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife . time passes and crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case . crowe takes on a new patient named cole sear ( haley joel osment ) who claims that he is able to see dead people around him . `` the sixth sense '' created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending . yet , if the truth be told , the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science-fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride . the entire success of `` the sixth sense '' hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately shyamalan 's use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough . from the beginning of the film , one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold . the acting is first rate with willis , osment , toni collette , and olivia williams turning in great work . willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action-oriented roles . however , even with all the quality acting on display , you just can not shake the feeling that the `` the sixth sense '' is essentially just a drawn-out `` twilight zone '' episode when all is said and done
0	albert pyun is my absolute least favorite director . i hate his guts . his direction ruined `` cyborg '' and was murky in `` omega doom . '' this is his best flick , and it 's not that good . in fact , it pales in comparison to the so-so original . sasha mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable , but highly forgettable . the villain from the first , tong po , has returned after killing the sloan brothers from the first movie . now , he 's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother david sloan . standard martial arts fare . some choppy fight scenes , but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy . this is my fourth video , and i 've only had problems with one , and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it . got ta agree with a. huck on the dsl , though . while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great
0	i was not thrilled with this work . here 's why : the movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow . it is beautifully filmed with great costumes , colors , imagery but the acting is so bland , almost weak ! christ , i wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate ! the sex scenes were boring . maybe i should make films ! this is frustrating ! ! it had it 's moments so , 2 stars . wish someone would make a movie about 'narcissus and goldmund ' or 'cloister and the hearth ' . now that would be passionate ! ( unless amblin or touchstone did it ) .
0	pleasant movie but nothing special , a very ordinary story . audrey hepburn 's charisma is what puts some life to the movie . some subtle humour though
1	wonderful and beautifully transferred to dvd . excellent production numbers and this just might be my new favorite judy movie . grab that bucket of popcorn pop in the dvd and let judy do her thing . she is wonderful . it will be just a fun evening
1	loved this movie ! eddie is in his element ; this movie will leave you cheering on the edge of your seat . both eddie and director robert m. young are magical
1	the great thing about this `` movie version '' is that all the original voices of clifford ( john ritter ) , emily elizabeth , cleo , and t-bone are exactly the same as the clifford episodes on tv . basically , it is a longer version of a regular clifford episode but they 've added a few new friends and some songs here and there . speaking of , the songs are actually upbeat and a bit catchy . but not so catchy to where i find the tunes stuck in my head for hours ... ... ..unlike some other kid movies ( i.e . - thomas the tank engine ) where they play the same droning chorus over and over and over again . this movie is a great compromise because my 2 and a 1/2 year old son loves it , and after watching it with him numerous times now , i still like it too .
1	nuts is a great movie from barbra streisand . one of her best acting performances ! the movie is about a high class call girl named claudia ( barbra streisand ) who kills a client in self defense . her parents want to avoid scandal by having her declared mentally incompetant to stand trial . after attacking her attorney , her case is taken over by a legal aide attorney ( richard dreyfuss ) . claudia does n't do much to help her case , with her constant outbursts in the courtroom . it was a really well done drama , with an interesting plot and good acting all around
0	i am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year . i show the movie and this is a terrible version . they leave out almost the whole story , and change the rest . it is such a great book and i think they could have done a better job on the video . i am always hoping a newer and better version is made
1	this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema , and it made a strong impression on me . the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me . i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective , although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done . watching it many years later , i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era . the carpet and some of the clothes were funny , but it did n't detract from the film . glad i bought it
0	this movie is god awful . i mean poor rene zellwegger . being cast in this movie . what did she turn down if this is what she picked . do n't get this movie see it on tv . do n't even rent it . do n't get it please . i 'm saving you 12 bucks
0	this movie is the worst piece of clap trap that i have ever seen . built in the mold of the rambo series , the film tries to play off of the west 's fear of the soviet union . you 'd be better of watching a `` how to pour milk '' instructional video , than watch this film that will make you less smart
0	typical of the war movies of that age . very much the americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice . i enjoyed looking at an america that was . would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life
1	`` you know , if anything happens to me you 're in command , '' says sergeant kelly ( thomas mitchell ) to corporal colin spence ( henry fonda ) . they 're lost in the libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car , almost no water and a busted compass . sergeant kelly started out with corporal spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol . three german fighters changed things . now there 's only sergeant kelly , spence and four others . `` nothing 's going to happen to you , sergeant , '' spence says . `` i mean , it ca n't . '' `` it wo n't , lad , if i can help it . still , if i stop a packet it 's up to you to get this patrol back ... and that 's not an easy job . '' `` but i 'm no leader , '' spence says . `` i have n't had the experience to take up a command like this with other men 's lives depending on me . i can carry out orders but i ca n't give them . i 'm just a civilian with a couple of chevrons on my sleeve . '' the immortal sergeant tells us the story of colin spence , a small-town reporter from canada in england , who is shy and not really able to accomplish the things he wants . please note that while elements of the plot are discussed , the key elements are all described on the dvd case . it 's obvious valentine ( maureen o'hara ) loves him but he just ca n't seem to recognize the signals . just before he enlists , she and colin meet an old friend of colin 's at a party . benedict ( reginald gardner ) is now a famous war correspondent . `` good old colin . i tell you this lad has a head on his shoulders , '' says benedict to valentine . `` i 'm afraid he 's a little bit too self-effacing for the times , though . you know , like the good old democracies . nice , but a little bit too civilized for his own good , eh colin ? '' benedict smoothly moves in on valentine and colin can only look on . spence keeps remembering valentine while he and the rest of the patrol struggle through the desert . now on foot , the sergeant leads the men in an attack on an isolated german armored car . they hope to find water and perhaps even capture the car and drive back to their own lines . the sergeant is clear about what they must do . `` this war , like every other war , is going to be won by men on their feet with guns in their hands . and do n't you forget it , '' he tells them . but the car is destroyed in the attack , the cans of german water with it , and two more men in the patrol die . the sergeant is one of them . colin spence has no choice but to take command now . and slowly , as he faces the reality of the situation , he becomes more forceful and more resourceful . the three other men , one a little reluctantly , accept his leadership . he knows he does n't have the answers . he relies on his memory of sergeant kelly and his memory of valentine to keep him moving forward . at the climax , he leads a desperate attack on an oasis guarded by three times the number of germans . it is an attack which is bravely led and fought . back in a cairo hospital , colin spence sums it up . `` i had to come all the way out here to meet a tough sergeant named kelly who was born in a slum and educated in an army camp before i was fit for a woman like valentine . he 's dead now but he taught me one thing ... if i ever want valentine or anything else worthwhile in life i 've got to fight for it . that 's not a bad thing for a man to find out ... or for a nation , either , for that matter ... to fight . '' this is an appealing war-time movie with little of the bravado and obvious emotional string-pulling of most war movies . thomas mitchell gives a fine performance and maureen o'hara would be any man 's dream of the woman waiting back home . what takes this movie out-of-the-ordinary is henry fonda . did any major hollywood star , before or after , combine so effectively almost naive honesty , decency and acting skill . we sympathize with colin spence 's shyness ; we sympathize with spence 's nervousness at the idea of being in charge if his sergeant is killed ; we see and approve of spence 's taking on the responsibility of leading the remaining men of the patrol ; and we come to admire his dedication to do the right thing , to fight against the odds for a good cause . the immortal sergeant is a film that with time sort of slipped between the cracks . dvd has brought it back and it 's worth seeing . the dvd transfer is just fine . there are no significant extras .
0	the movie like it is , directed by paul oremland , has to deal with a boxer/fighter craig ( steve bell ) as a guy who is trying to crawl out from the fighting life he is in . craig meets matt ( ian rose ) who is a band manager/record producer who takes a romantic interest in craig and the two head off to london . it is in london that trouble begins to unravel the relationshi as matt 's boss tries to split the two up . the movie wraps up with matt trying to get craig back before their relationship is doomed . both steve bell and ian rose do a decent job of acting in spite of the terrible script that is so disjointed by terrible editting and poor scene transition . there really is nothing new in this film : drugs run rampart , pretty boys litter the set , and sleazy gritty characters are plentiful . in addition , the fight scenes make you wince with how fake it come across . the lack of character development does n't fully connect the viewer and the drama happening to the characters in the story , thus by the time half the movie is done you really do n't care if craig and matt get together or not . the only glimmer of promise in this movie was the techno soundtrack which was fairly funky and enjoyable . finally , when the movie comes to an abrupt end , like it is seems more like a recipe on what a movie should n't be
0	i have loved riverdance since the first time i saw it on pbs . i could wait till i received my riverdance : live from new york dvd so many years ago . recently , i had a chance to see it on tour when it came to los angeles . i had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything i could hope for ( with the exception of them having removed the song `` home in the heartland '' which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle ) . that night , i ordered not only riverdance : live from geneva , but also jean butler 's irish dance dvd ( which i would recommend ) . to make a long story short , do n't waste your time with this version of the show . the main female singer is absolutely horrible ( definitely does n't hold a candle to katie macmahon 's original vocals ) , and the lead female dancer 's too short hair drove me crazy . do yourself a favor and purchase the 1999 dvd live from new york . i promise you wo n't be disappointed
0	( what do holly hunter and burt reynolds have in common ? ) just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser , this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic new zealand maori . the tribe had it right , though , ignore these two losers and stick with the trees
1	anthony hopkins is absolutely riveting as adolf hitler . he captures all of hitler 's mannerisms , quirks , and facial expressions . my only complaint is that he does n't use a german accent . the production is poor , and there are some flaws in the story . for example , albert speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film . it has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by speer . the guy who plays joseph goebbels is horrible , one of the worst acting jobs i 've seen . but overall the acting is great , and the performance by hopkins makes this movie worth owning
0	this is only a portion of this episode . it cuts off in the middle of a sentence
1	my wife had been fed up with all of the legal dramas i was maknig her watch . being a third year law student she always netpicks the details . but the story in this fil overrides the legal fallacies , making true believer a great drama that centers around a lawsuit
0	this movie is watchable , but barely . its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions ... .and see leatherface as a ... .never mind , youll have to see for yourselves . we have a yound renee zellweger in this one .
1	this movie is a wonderful follow up to the first ... anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time . i highly recommend this movie to anyone
0	this is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes . however that 's about all the good things i can say about it . i can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off , getting killed by a walking suit of armor , etc.. there 's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary i still have no idea . maybe i lost something with the english dubbing . once i lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot . there 's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in i do n't know . the ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view . i do n't want to ruin the 'suspense ' by telling what happens . based on reading the high praises of other reviewers i may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie . give me `` frankenstein meets the wolfman '' or `` brides of blood '' any day over this movie . jeff marzano recommended further viewing : horror hotel it ! ( the terror from beyond space ) invasion of the saucer men not of this earth ( original ) phantasm the blob ( with steve mcqueen ) the brain that would n't die the flesh eaters the fly / the return of the fly / the curse of the fly the four skulls of jonathan drake the hideous sun demon the hypnotic eye the incredible shrinking man the indestructible man the manster the thing ( from another world ) the thing that could n't die the twilight zone collections
1	`` el-hazard : the magnificent world '' is an anime very much in the `` tenchi muyo ! '' mold : a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women . though the characters in `` el-hazard '' are n't developed as deeply as the `` tenchi '' crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing , `` el-hazard '' has a charm all it own . the mysterious antiheroine ifurita is compelling , and the kids ' hard-drinking teacher fujisawa is consistently funny . most impressively , `` el-hazard '' tells a complete and satisfying story , tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist . usually these types of shows start strong , only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings . even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved ! the dub is also pretty darn good , though it tends to get overly shouty , especially in the segments centering on jinnai . ca n't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone ? `` el-hazard '' is hardly the type of show that will change your life , but if you like `` tenchi '' or other anime in this vein , this box set is probably a good bet . ( the set actually contains two separate shows : the original `` el-hazard '' oav and its 4-episode sequel `` el-hazard 2 . '' the sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately does n't really add any value . )
0	how on earth casper van diem accept to shoot this film i will never know . it 's a joke , unfortunately not a good joke ... special effects ? forget it . good acting ? the actors seem to never have heard about it . a plot ? nosense . what is this , can somebody tell me ? the so called `` sharks '' do n't scare even a three-year old child !
1	i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg-1 which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still . love being able to download them all , just wish they 'd get updated quicker ! honestly , when i left 2 weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i 've missed the next 2
0	warning : movie spoiler below ! ! ! i confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film , is grounded in recent history . i was around in the early 80s , when l. ron hubbard and his scientologists were going full-bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie ( the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like chuck norris , or so i thought ) , when all of a sudden hubbard died , and the whole project apparently fell apart . back then , i was close to 20 years old and i was curious about whatever it was that these scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person 's quality of life ... then i read about larry wollersheim 's 1985 lawsuit . you can figure the rest out for yourself . anyhow , oh , yeah , the movie ... the storyline is your basic alien invasion number , i.e. , the invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans ( in this film , the aliens look a lot like the klingons from star trek ) , until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the invaders to get off of our planet . pretty simple and straightforward , but hey , there are other films much worse than battlefield earth , and they 've taught me that if you have good enough special effects , even the lamest sci-fi storylines can work ! the thing that stood out about this film , though , was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue , and as a result , it came across as rather corny ... a film to be recommended for its comedy value , rather than for things like epic space battle scenes . also , the `` bad guy '' aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects , in order to keep them from organizing revolts ... i must say , trying to depict mind-manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a cd -- -it turns it into a confusing , incomprehensible mess ! a couple of times , the picture would break up into a concentric blur , and i 'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on . how the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like warner to help them film it , is something which will forever remain a mystery to me . i remember just before this picture opened , a group of scientologists were trying to hype it : `` oh , watch -- -this film is going to be bigger than star wars and gone with the wind combined ! '' you can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized ... can you say `` oops ''
0	the cat in the hat by dr. seuss by shawn hinz , this book is about a talking cat and two kids . two kid 's parents are gone for the day . the furry talking cat just comes in to there house and takes over the kid 's house . sally and her brother try to talk the cat out of making the house a mess all of the things he is going to do . the cat is trying to entertain the two kids inside the house because it is raining . the cat is tall and is wearing a tall hat with stripes on it and is walking on his two feet . at the kids house the cat messes everything up in the house while the kid 's mother is gone . the more trick 's the cat pulls the more the house is messed up . they did not trust the cat because he just walked through the door and takes over . but the cat has two friends and they help the cat mess up the house . people should not just let any buddy walk in there house . you need to trust people when they come in your house when your parents are not home . the mom of the two kids did not find out that the cat was in the house . the two kid 's house was really messed up . the kids where thinking that to never let the cat in the house when there mom is not home or ever again . the mother of the two kids never found out that the cat was at the house and that the cat messed up the house .
1	the labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy . this has always been one of my favorite films , and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more . jennifer connelly gives a superb performance as sarah , the main character , whose baby brother is taken by the goblin king ( david bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time ; he wrote and performed all the music , which is also some of his best work ) . sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive labyrinth to save her brother in time before he 's turned into a goblin . along the way , we encounter a large cast of jim henson 's puppet-creatures , some of which become sarah 's friends and helpers in her journey . the puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people . the movie is filled with magic , both on and off screen . the film is supplemented on this dvd with a `` making-of '' documentary - an original feature , narrated largely by jim henson himself - made during the actual production of the film ( released in 1986 ) . such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation , how they operate , and how they interact with the sets and other characters ( especially in this case with the live actors ) . it 's a lot of fun to see this `` inside '' look , and more than anything gives a real sense of who jim henson was and how much this all really meant to him . my favorite quote from jim henson in this documentary was when he said ( about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie ) , `` when i go see a film , when i leave the theater ... i like to be happier than i was when when i went in , i like to leave with an up feeling , and i like a picture to have a sense of substance , to be about life and the things that matter to me , '' - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age . lighthearted , fun , fantastical , funny , beautiful , exciting , and more `` real '' than many of today 's `` realities '' - extremely enjoyable and uplifting . as an added bonus , monty python member terry jones wrote the script ( and is interviewed in the documentary ) . cheryl mcfadden ( star trek : tng 's beverly crusher ) also did all the choreography in the film ( for both humans and puppets ) . : -

0	good cast , adaptation of king lear . do n't bother unless you are really bored
1	this is one of my favorite movies . besides containing a stellar cast ( matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , sammuel l. jackson , oliver platt , donald and keifer sutherland , kevin spacey ) you get the idea . is there a cast member that isn't a biggie ? the casting is genious , and the acting incredible . it 's suspenseful , deep , very emotional.. slightly dark.. it 's the perfect movie . even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you . a time to kill 's plot is pretty simply explained . in the deep south , a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks , who almost kill her . a young white lawyer and father ( matthew mcconaughey as jake brigance ) is sickened at the news , and does n't quite know what to think when the little girl 's father ( sammuel l. jackson as carl lee hailey ) pays him a visit and asks if he 'd `` help him if he were in a tight spot '' . the next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment , carl lee hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher . jake brigance agrees to defend hailey as his murder trial begins . the insanity plea is used to `` give the jury an excuse to aquit '' but in my opinion , i think it was quite legitimate . what father wouldn't be driven insane under the circumstances ? the rest of the movie is carl lee hailey 's trial and the surrounding drama as kkk violence emerges led by kiefer sutherland , and jake 's life and home are in danger , his relationship with his wife strained , and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle . my favorite scene ? it might come as a surprise , but my favorite scene is when the prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial . he was caught in the knee by a stray bullet , and now has half a leg . after the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against carl lee , and establish unerring identity of the shooter , the defence asks him two questions . `` do you think carl lee intentionally shot you ? '' `` no '' `` do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did ? '' `` he did what i would have done . '' but it does n't end there as the policeman ( remember he 's missing a leg because of what carl lee hailey did ) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like carl lee did . he starts screaming to the jury to `` turn him loose , he 's a hero ! '' i think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes ( albeit there are many others too ) ( great acting by chris cooper as the policeman ) anyway.. forgive if i rambled . i love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas ... star studded casts.. john grisham ... suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. you need to see this .
1	here 's another great film that sprung forth from the czech new wave : another film that , through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements . i 'll leave it for you all to discover forman 's delightful insights into human behavior in loves of a blonde . suffice it to say , the plot -- -which involves a young girl 's ( hana brejchová ) attempt to find true love as a factory girl -- -could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands . in forman 's , the whole thing is grounded on earth . instead of being a weightless romantic comedy , loves of a blonde aims for realism , and while forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings , everything that happens to her -- -she finds love in a piano player , makes love to him one night , and then eventually pursues him to his home , where she meets his ever-bickering parents -- -still has its own kind of weight to it . the only way i can describe it is , i guess , the weight of real life . i have n't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than i saw in the second half of loves of a blonde , with milda 's parents : it is comic , yes , but it is also uncannily realistic , and maybe you 'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film . as for the blonde of the movie ... well , she does n't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses , but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player milda : she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life . understand that , and you 'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad . ( her dream has been shattered , but she keeps on believing it anyway , either out of hope or simply desperation . ) but enough of my pretentious analysis , hehe . the point is , milos forman 's loves of a blonde , like jiri menzel 's arguably more celebrated closely watched trains , is a film that , though short at 85 minutes , takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression , in its own light and subtle way . its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie ; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation , it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do . recommended
0	`` the world according to garp '' is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time . it 's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud , but still really feel the emotion of the characters , and the story really sticks with you . ( i made a joke about an ellen jamesian just the other day , lol ~ yes , it was a dumb joke that no one else got , but , that 's how it goes sometimes : ) i was introduced to the book in college , well after the book and the movie were released , but i had never heard of either one . i read the book in just a couple of days ~ i could n't put it down , and i chatted it up with everyone who would listen . i 've re-read it several times since then , and i still think it 's terrific . naturally , when i found out there was already a movie . . . i was thrilled ! i ordered it right away . . . but i wish i 'd never wasted my money . on it 's own , the movie might be alirght . but when you 're invested in the book , when you know the characters , robin williams just is n't garp . i love robin williams , he 's a great comedian , that 's not a question . i just think that the casting for this part was way off base . and if you ca n't believe the main character , the rest of it 's crap . if you 've never read the book , i highly recommend it ! !
0	michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion . he has done such great b-movies as this , q , and it 's alive 3 : island of the alive . how awesome is he ? ? anyways , i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously , thinking that it is going to be your typical movie . but you should n't because not only is this a b-movie , but it is supposed to be funny . my favorite part is when `` the stuff '' started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it . who would do that ? ? i just started laughing by butt off when that happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth , do n't be too critical on it . what i learned from the stuff : dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth ! if you like the stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such as island of the alive 3 , zombi 3 and 4 , etc
0	this is only a portion of this episode . it cuts off in the middle of a sentence
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
1	after i saw this film , i went in my backyard and tried digging , then my mom yelled at me . now i 'm older and i am going to order this dvd . the movie is awesome , it 's a classic in my mind
0	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky , i found `` altered states '' , his first novel , terribly disappointing . the film was , in my view , utterly dismal . the only reason i would recommend it , would be as an example of `` hack movie making '' . if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell , both would be relegated to obscurity
0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! `` fats '' the dummy steals lots of the scenes . the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager . one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith . he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see `` fats '' , but during some of the more `` romantic `` scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush . don , t miss the extras where they talk with the real `` vent '' that worked with them on the movie . if you like movies that are a bit `` outside '' this is a must have for any collection . pete cavan
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	although it is very funny , and it is about talking animals that drive cars , `` the wind in the willows '' is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own . that would be the disney cartoon version , not the book , which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group . it is great to read aloud , however , and for older kids who love nature and humor , `` the wind in the willows '' could lead to a lifetime love of books . `` the wind in the willows '' reminds me of the victorian humor book `` three men in a boat '' , because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky english bachelors messing about in boats on the river . it is funny , with real slapstick comedy , and it is also touching , because it deals with friendship and loyalty , and beautiful , because it is about nature , and love of the countryside and home .
0	i rented this movie from netflix recently , expecting a wonderfully campy , cheesy horror film . wrong . its just an hour and a half of boring film . the plot is lacking , the characters are annoying , especially duane . its simply a ridiculous film
0	the story of wim wenders ' `` wings of desire '' is told through images and thoughts . abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it . two angels glide through the streets of berlin surveying its inhabitants . cassiel ( otto sander ) embraces his role as witness but damiel ( bruno ganz ) wants to break free of his ethereal existence . he is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life . the primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist marion ( solveig dommartin ) . `` wings of desire '' does not quite work . it stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous . rather , it stumbles because it is just too abstract . relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking , but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives . `` wings of desire '' deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals . yet , it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer .
1	an old movie , but a good movie . the end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow . heston and robertson do a great job of acting . the pace is a little slower than current special effects of today 's movies . if you are not a fast paced dude and can slow down , then i would recommend this one for you
1	a little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative . touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both mr. welles and the brazilian culture . if there is one reason to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of the film . a piece called `` four men on a raft '' it is the most beautiful black and white short film i have ever seen . the love mr. welles had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent
0	this item is supposedly titled `` ufos : the first encounters . '' it is , however , an episode about reincarnation . it is incorrectly labeled . do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	i watched this film twice today , which is always what happens when a film touches me ; i immediately want to watch it again . and i got to this site because i was looking for the ost , but anway , here 's what i thought ; the acting was perfection , the story a beautiful observation , the dancing seductive and melancholic and overall the film gave a very real potrayal of the difficult choices many women make for themselves , their consequences , and how they deal with these choices in light of both mudane everyday reality and the hyper reality of nightlife . i laughed , cried and all that stuff . then i watched all the dvd extras . and then i watched it all again . it was well worth the guy in the video shop giving me a funny look at the checkout . any girl whose ever daydreamed about stripping ( you know who you are ) should watch this film . not to change your mind , but just to have a look see . it 'll give you a new empathy and sympathy for all women in the industry . and it 'll make you want to work out for a tighter ass
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	this movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy . the cast is great . ed walters ( tim robbins ) the garage mechanic falls in love at first sight of catherine ( meg ryan ) when she appears at his gas station with a failing car with her pretentious fiance james mooreland ( stephen fry ) . ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door . the door opens and there is albert einstein ( walter matthau ) `` you 're albert einstien ! '' `` zank you '' and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring ed and catherine together . the subcharacters are great ! especially einstein 's pals played by lou jacobi , gene saks , and joseph maher . `` three of the greatest minds and together they ca n't change a light bulb . '' all in all a great warm funny film ! matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant . he should have been nominated imho . you ca n't go wrong with this one
0	carly simon 's the only one worth watching on this dvd , but she 's only in the film for 69 seconds , and her only line is `` i read that sh-t you wrote about me . `` and thats what this movie i
0	i thought i 'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all . i was n't old enough at the time , but i 'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of friday the 13th . tommy , now a teenager ( and a bloody old one at that ) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of jason and also the death of his mother . tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that jason is back from the dead . and it seems he may be right , when a series of murders begins . but who could it possibly be this time . jason is dead , is n't he ? it 's up to tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of jason voorhees ? friday the 13th part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before . the body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired . was it really necessary ? is too much , too much ? the only ounce of credibility in this film is harry manfredini 's reprisal musical score . other than that , you 'd be forgiven for skipping this friday the 13th entry
1	this was never meant to win an academy award . it 's simply a fun , classic country filled ho-down film with the intent to showcase some of the better country artists of the sixties . the acting is below average , and i would n't want it any other way . that 's the charm with these two `` hillbilly '' films starring ferlin husky . it 's nostalgia at it 's best , and you can bet the farm-fence that i 'll be watching this many times again . forget the mamie , and jayne talk ; they were a bonus to this classic clunker . they were never meant to steal the show . pick up `` hillbillys in a haunted house '' too . that one will do a number on you that you 're not likely to forget anytime soon
0	this video did not live up to my expectations . i have a five-year-old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close . the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression . instead , ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with , and focuses on puppy socialization in the video . well , that 's great if i had a puppy , but i adopted an older dog , and i need help now . i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems . if you have a puppy , it might be somewhat helpful , but there are better books
0	while many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare , there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted , yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror . in my more than four decades on this planet , there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief , disgust and abhorrence that i actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing . it was a film so onerous , pointless and unfunny , that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time , money and talent in the history of western civilization . that film is `` cabin boy . '' to some , `` cabin boy '' may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening 's entertainment , assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper . imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich . that 's the kind of inventive , knee-slapping , laugh-out-loud fun you 'll find in `` cabin boy . '' having some respect for chris elliott 's work on the old letterman show on nbc , i was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor . if it does n't induce deep rem sleep , `` cabin boy '' will surely leave you either angry or depressed . one would venture to guess these were not the results elliott intended . letterman 's genius-level cameo notwithstanding , `` cabin boy '' is about as funny as a prostate exam ... without the `` local '' and the lube .
1	i love it sooooo much it 's the big new thing ... ca n't wait 4 the next episode..
0	there are so many reviews saying this is a true story i have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real ( obviously ) , about everything else is dramatized ( including the mission objectives : scud hunting on foot , which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today ) . mcnab has essentially written tom clancy genre fiction . the book bravo two zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol , chris ryan , called the one that got away . however , both are convincingly debunked by a third sas memeber in a book called the real bravo two zero , also available on amazon , though only the uk amazon site ( which you can still order from in the us ) . in it , an sas member who can actually speak arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people mcnab and ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story . most importantly , he manages to restore , without a doubt , the reputation of vince phillips , blamed by ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the iraqis and a couple members eventually killed . contrary to what you may expect , i would recommend seeing this , in fact i recommend getting and comparing all three books : b20 , the one that got away , and the real b20
0	please all this is far from sam elliot 's better westerns . see `` the sacketts ' , `` conagher '' , `` the shadow riders '' , or `` the quick and the dead '' . this is far less a believable western . few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern , not authentic . sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie . not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters i would want to see developed
0	something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is 4 stars . this is truely the worst adaptation of a novel ever made . costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography . this movie is far beyond awful
1	if one likes old westerns , especially written by louis lemore , it is excellent and so is the actors , especially sam elliot and katherine ross
1	this is a classic in every sense of the word . and like any real classic , it gets better with age . `` a charlie brown christmas '' is a sweet , simple show with a powerful message . every aspect of this production is great . but the fact of the matter is that this is the kind of cartoon that does n't get made anymore . now it 's all about the trash-talkin ' simpsons and their moronic kind . also , because god plays a part in the message of this christmas special , it could not be made today . it might offend believers in allah , or hurt the sensitive feelings of atheists . therefore , such a production could never get off the ground . it 's just as well . there is really nothing that could suprass this masterpiece . buy it and make it a part of your christmas traditions through the years

1	wild orchid . most people think its some smut movie with no plot . no one ever looks between the lines . it may have sex , and some crazy acting , and even a bogus plot , but the theme of it is important . true love . call me sentimental and a hopeless romantic , but this movie touched me . emily and wheeler , opposites in every way , somehow find love , together . i wish everyone was as lucky . to find happiness where you least expect it . i wish i could be as happy as those two . look around you . do you see people with this kind of passion and love ? it 's sad , too , because we know what happened to the actors who played these lovers . i hope that someone out there has a relationship like this so that we have more to cling to then fiction . it may not have been the best movie , but it had an important message : when you find true love grab it with both hands and never let go .
0	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful `` eat drink man woman '' . frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first.. i just finished watching eat drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago . anyway , i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup , eat drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me . if you have n't seen either , see the better of the two ( exact same stories ) : eat drink man woman
1	okay , for all those who are fans of the orwell classic , you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen . we 're dealing with talking animals relating to humans . this tale is too deep for the `` movie public '' and any movie will fall short for true purists . taking it for what it is , it is an accurate depiction of the novel . the reviewer who did n't see moses the raven in the story must have watched a different film . it is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what animal farm represented when originally written . take that and put it under the hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who have n't read the novel . i truly enjoyed this film . i reccomend it for all . even if it is a little difficult to follow . unlike the box says , it is not for children
1	after 81 years , i have decided to give up on the great dramatic movies that present the world in all its massive turmoil . i get all that from newspapers , periodicals , radio , televisiopn and now , even the inernet . i want to watch movies that i call `` feel good '' movies . these movies cemnter on a small group of people with a few insignificant problems and then , over the course of an hour or so , workout the kinks of thier lives and live happily ever after . these movies can be full of pathos or bathos or even slap stick comdedy , but they never present you with any problem greater than how to get your mother-in-law to babysit the kids but not move in with you ... unless you want her to . cold comfort farm meets my criteria to be classifid as a `` feel good '' movie .
1	this is a truly funny movie . the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is . this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night . it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
0	it 's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe-horned into such a bad movie . i do n't see how it could have yielded six 5-star reviews ( the godfather it ai n't ) . using its better scenes , you could put together a trailer for this movie that would make you want to see it . and you may be entertained through much of the movie . but when the story becomes quite nonsensical in the final minutes of the movie , you will feal cheated and wish that you had watched something else . at least that 's how everyone in my family felt when we watched it
1	boyz n the hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named tre styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of south central los angeles . after a confrontation with a classmate at his school , tre 's mother forces him to go and live with his father furious . she says , `` the last thing i want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed . look at me , i 'm serious . i love you . you 're my only son . '' she just ca n't take his problems anymore . after being dropped off at his fathers place , tre grows through 5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old . all the while furious tells tre , `` you know tre you may think i 'm being hard on you right now , but i 'm not . what i 'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible . its like your little friends across the street , they do n't have anybody to show them how to do that . and you 're gon na see how they end up too . '' his next door neighbors chris , doughboy , and ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets . ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into usc on a scholarship . meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang ( the crips ) , pushing drugs , boozing 40s ( oe ) , and running his mouth . ricky and tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive . one night at the strip on crenshaw , a group of bloods are strolling through , and one of them bumps into ricky on purpose trying to start crap . he says , `` f*** you lookin at nigga ? '' ricky shouts back , `` i 'm still trying to find out nigga ! '' doughboy hears the confrontation taking place , rushes up with his homeboys right by his side and says `` we got a problem here ? we got a problem ? he pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs . the bloods flash gang signs back . doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat ( cocking it ) . the gangsters give him a dirty look , turn their backs and walk away . right when the crowds are ready to leave , the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air . ricky and tre drive off together saying , `` ca n't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap . '' they get pulled over and hassled by the cops . tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions . she comforts him and they end up making love . about 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie , rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal . he walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal , a container of milk , and several lottery tickets . ricky and tre are walking back home and ricky is totally unaware that his sat scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home . he scored just enough to get him accepted into usc . the red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying , `` theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night . '' the gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching ricky and tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street . the fellas inside the car are shouting , `` cut him off man . lets kill him . come on man , go . '' the leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them . doughboy and his homies are waiting on the porch chilling when the red car races past with its system booming . doughboy knows something is up and he races inside , grabs his gat , and the guys jump into the car , racing to find ricky tre . ricky and tre are walking down the alley . ricky is finishing scratching off his lottery ticket when the car full of bloods pulls up . tre shouts , `` ricky ! '' ricky sees the car , drops his bag , and runs as fast as he can away from the car . by that time it is too late . a 12 gauge shotgun gets raised and blasts two shots . the first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest , knocking him to the ground . there is so much blood all over . tre tries to comfort him ricky and keep him concious as doughboys car pulls up . ricky dies in tres arms and they take him home . rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that doughboy is the one who shot him . she starts beating on him like crazy . tre pulls him away from her on the porch . tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells doughboy `` meet me at my house in 5 minutes . '' tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home . tre walks into his fathers bedroom and loads a .357 magnum . he wants to kill the guys responsible for murdering his best friend right in front of him . furious does his best to stop tre from commiting murder by confronting him in the living room and demands him to hand the gun over . tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing . his dad says , `` your my only son and i 'm not gon na lose you to any crap . i love you man . go clean yourself up . go on . '' tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car . he jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car . they race off and his father and buddy chris are thinking , `` oh shoot . '' tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic bloody afternoon . tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out . they do as he wants . the guys in the car let him out and they drive off into the night looking for the thugs who murdered his friend . they pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table . they load cock a fully automatic ak-47 , turn off the lights on the car , and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table . the car comes to a screeching halt , doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood . they peel out of the parking lot and the following morning tre ends up talking to tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood . doughboy says , `` they sure pushed the clock on rick man . i ai n't got no brother . next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me . do n't matter though . we all got ta go sometime huh ? '' tre tries to comfort him by saying , `` hey dough . you still got one brother left man . '' doughboy says , `` thanks man . '' doughboy and tre embrace with a hug . doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of oe as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying `` 2 weeks later doughboy is murdered . '' how sad . personally i did n't like the ending . it wants to get out the message that the violence never seems to stop . tre his girl survive and go to college out of state later in the fall . a very powerful and moving story that should be shown to every young man woman near high school age . although the movie has a lot of language and is very violent , it has an important message that needs to get across to everyone . `` increase the peace
1	this movie was my all-time favorite when i was little . and robin hood was definitely my all-time favorite disney character . i remember how i 'd sit at the kitchen table and draw countless pictures of robin hood , and how i 'd sit in front of our family computer and write stories involving robin hood . today , i have other disney favorites , but i still love robin hood . and i still watch the movie from time to time . i 'm hoping they 'll release a 2-disc special edition fairly soon . robin hood makes a dashing outlaw , and i love his oversized sidekick little john . the villain , prince john , seems more comical than intimidating . i love the scene where he cries for his `` mommy '' and sucks on his thumb while holding his ear at the same time . seems like a childish thing for a royal prince to do , do n't you agree ? if you do n't have this movie , then go purchase a copy of it , or at least rent it from a movie store . you wo n't be disappointed .
1	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is- even for a grown-up , like me . it could do without all the songs ( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing , ) but it 's brisk , double-layered humor more than makes up for it . kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly . adults will pick up on the nearly-sarcastic , nearly risque dialog , so rare in disney animated movies . plus , big foot dancing to 'stayin ' alive ' is just freaking hilarious . basically , it 's just a disney movie . but it 's a *great ( and severely under appreciated ) disney movie
1	another hilarious cube vision movie . mike epps is one of the funniest guys on the planet and cube 's serious personna make for a classic goofy guy/straight guy combination . get some popcorn , take a few deep breaths , cause you will laugh . its a gas ! !
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy . this is my fourth video , and i 've only had problems with one , and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it . got ta agree with a. huck on the dsl , though . while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about 5 mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
1	i 'm absolutely shocked that the critical reaction to this movie has been so negative . i was overwhelmed by `the weight of water . ' i guess part of the problem is that the ad campaign seems to have presented it as a thriller , which it 's not . it 's also not a mystery or a love story . it 's a slow-paced , decidedly downbeat look at two women who are trapped in loveless relationships . basically , it consists of two parts , a modern-day part and a historical part , set in the 19th century . the 19th century part shows promise and actually gives a pretty interesting view of how a mysterious double murder took place , but ultimately it 's underdeveloped and i 'll have to admit is a bit slow . however , compared to the modern-day part , the 19th century part is sort of oscar material . but as you watch this film you will notice that the modern-day part seems to rely on two major things : liz hurley 's breasts and some endlessly drawn out shots and quasi-philosophical conversations which really do n't have much of a storyline . kathryn bigelow 's direction is masterful . she uses images and sounds to express the powerful passions which the two main characters feel but ca n't express themselves . she gets excellent performances out of the entire cast , but sarah polley is especially fine . i 'm sure the fact that none of the characters are sympathetic ( at least not in the usual sense ) is one of the reasons people are n't responding to the film . bigelow is n't telling a simple story here , and she does n't want to manipulate the audience by trotting out the usual clichés . this is a complicated movie about how complicated love really is . i have n't read anita shreves 's novel , but i 'd like to . i imagine bigelow was attracted to it because it offered a blunt , unsentimental look at relationships . `the weight of water ' is not a conventional hollywood entertainment . if you 're open to it , if you throw away your preconceptions , you may be surprised at where this film takes you .
1	187 is a strange movie about schools . it 's strange because this is one of the few pictures that looks at a teacher 's perspective of the system and it 's strange because it 's not a rosy picture of schools . jackson 's portrayal of trevor garfield paints a picture of a nervous , worried teacher who was passionate about teaching , but is now scared of the slightest sound , continually checking the corner of his eye , as he 's been faced with a near fatal attack a year earlier . what the film is about is the various teachers ' reactions to the students around them . garfield wants to do good , but has a past that is burning him up inside . john heard 's character is a teacher who 's embittered by the students , working to merely cash a paycheck , while kelly rowan 's character means well , but is scared and confides in jackson 's character because he is a survivor . what i love about the film is that there is a realism in the way the teachers communicate with each other . the good and the bad is here . we get a picture of the various attitudes teachers have about their kids and how some events can make or break a teacher . i also love how 187 explores the political and sometimes beuaracratic nature of the classrooms , including the placement of students in a given classroom , and how teachers can sometimes have their jobs put in jeopardy because of very rigid law . clearly , the writer scott yagemann , who is a teacher himself , feels the system has failed and has gotten in the way of a primary goal of teachers when they enter the profession : a desire to teach . the film is somewhat problematic with an over the top , preachy , and somewhat implausible conclusion . but the writer wears his heart on his sleeve and the above all message about the passion being sucked out of teaching is clear . for that reason , it 's as powerful a movie as any about teaching even if it lacks the uplifting conclusion so many others offer
1	audre hepburns debut . this ismy favorite movie of all time . a romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film i 've ever viewed . if you 're not moved by this story and it 's portrayal by command performances , then you 're not breathing
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode . not only did i get charged , but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge - i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund . once it finished downloading , it did n't play anyway . i gave up .
0	i am giving this one star only because it is on vhs and not dvd . i do n't even own a vcr anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house ! ! the day that they come out with all ten seasons on dvd i will buy them all and really wish i could now ! i just bought the pilot episode on dvd and am hoping that this will sell well and that they 'll go on to put all the seasons on dvd already . i know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them ! !
0	this movie is my favorite movie . ever . i feel terrible giving it two stars . but it gets 2 stars because i am comparing it to the rhino version , which i also own . i also own the original vhs . i have watched this movie at least once a year since i was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/hs . i can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head . buy the rhino version . if you ca n't find the rhino version , this is n't half bad . its just that that version is much better , and since i have been growing up with older copies , the new one 's flaws , minor to the newcomer , are blinding to me . i also am physically unable to watch any of the `` special edition '' star wars because of those changes , if that gives a clue to my movie anality . buy the rhino version if you can find it . one complaint is that the vhs had this cool `` glitter '' effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and unicron internals . it is present in the vhs , it came out wrong in the rhino version , and was totally gone in the 20th . thanks for deleting part of my childhood . in comparison to the rhino version : the remaster is terrible . mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts . the colors are totally off . hot rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange , it is orange like a cheaply made basketball . widescreen is fake . it is a cut fullscreen . i wish you were n't such a liar , sony . cover art : d- . no detail . looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two . the matrix looks like a honeydew . it would have got an f but prime is on there . very few of the extras were worth it . i bought this for the remaster , hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect , and they were n't there
0	ve2 has a ton of potential , but it just does n't work out . brandy davis is both cute and sexy , of course , but playboy 's testing the limits is a much better showcase for her , um , talents . not to be mean , but most of the film 's other women just are n't that attractive , and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack . contrary to a previous reviewer , the massage scene is fairly ordinary . the girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing , however . it starts really well , with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper , but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action . the only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette , with two girls and one guy hooking up . stay away from this one
1	high-energy encapsulation of the american spirit in this tough-tender production . done lean and hard-scrabble , as opposed to the lush and green hollywood version . curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is . aunt eller , the matriarch , as done by maureen lipman is tough , and loving . jimmy johnson , the welshman , jigs and does rope-tricks . shuler hensley 's jud is repulsive , and vulnerable . a classic . for your permanent library .
1	workout description : 30 minute routine workout level : beginner-intermediate instructor : tamilee webb ( has degrees in physical education and exercise science ; idea 's 1993 instructor of the year ; original buns of steel instructor ) . tamilee is soft-spoken but serious about what she is doing . she restricts her chatter to cueing and pointing out facts about the muscles you 're working . class : tamilee only music / set : the soft instrumental music is not intrusive . tamilee stands outdoors at some sort of country club . ( a few ducks waddle by to see what 's going on . ) equipment needed : mat . the workout can and should be done barefoot . caveats : follow tamilee 's suggestions in the introductions . as she says , always stretch to the point of tightness and never to the point of pain . additional comments : you do n't need a lot of space for this routine . you should be able to lie down with your arms and legs extended , and you should be able to kneel and stretch forward . this is geared towards the end of the day , since it includes a relaxation segment . the stretches are held for a decent amount of time ; they 're not very short , but they 're not very long . once you know the routine , you 'll be able to move into the stretch sooner and get a few more seconds in . this workout is available on dvd with total body stretch for beginners

1	michael moore strikes at the establishmewnt again ! moore 's best is still his first , 'roger and me , , but this is the next best . imagine my surprise as few yrs. , agao when a friend , who also votes third party , lent me the vhs of this and found out that moore is also a cheap trick fan . nielsen 's picture with moore is even on the back of the dvd sleeve ! a good effort , though moore 's somewhat leftist oc- cational leaniings may put some third party types off ... the far middle strikes back , again ! and rock on rick nielsen
0	i was expecting much more from this video . it did have kids doing poses , but it was hard to find the 13 year-old . some of the circle games looked like they might be fun . i wanted to show it to my third grade class , but i do n't think it would hold their interest . all in all i felt i was watching someone 's home video of their family doing yoga
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised . normally , i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan . however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch . while the idea behind the movie is good , it could have been more entertaing , dramatic , or suspensful . as another reviewer remarked , i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else . but , i did suffer through to the end , where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
0	the film shows no action , except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body , and you ask yourself , in what relation to the subject of the film this stands . ( sorry , forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man ) just the head of 17-year-old lads , who wonder why they got infected , when they work as prostitute , explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in prag . ( like advertising ) you are provided with not the least background information about their education , why they left their home town , why they have no normal job . i would wonder what politics think and do about the youth in the new ec-country , what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school , and what other chances they have in life
0	this was the movie that gave us the brat pack , a staple of a certain 80s cultural set . the term brat pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in st. elmo 's fire on a boozy night of partying . since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who were n't in the movie ( anthony michael hall , for example ) suffered a bit of a ripple effect . here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl 's bedroom wall . out of all the dramedies of the john hughes movies , this was the one i liked the least . maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered . maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college . it was trying to be the next generation `` graduate '' movie , and i did n't relate when my time came . maybe it had to do with the fact that i have been let down by many people and did n't have that network of friends in similar situations , and the isolation i felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia . i guess i was just a little more bitter . plus , as my life was surrounded by work and little else , i did n't have all the dramas going on they did . that was kind of sad , the one scene where rob lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team . it proves you really ca n't go home again and there are some clinging to the past . not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset . it 's not a bad story , but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold .

1	prepare yourself for an illuminating evening which begins in an upscale new york bar but slowly degenerates into visiting some of the more unseamly locations of the big city . the story revolves around rodger ( campbell scott ) , an egotistic , insecure , overly analytical wordsmith who has just been dumped by his female boss ( isabella rossellini ) . his sixteen year old nephew nick ( jesse eisenberg ) unexpectedly shows up in his office and roger decides to break the young boy in 'new york style . ' prepare for a crash course in how to pick up a woman as taught in the sometimes alluring , often times sleazy world of uncle roger , the proverbial lounge lizzard . dialogue is everything in this film and most of it comes from the incredibly glib and searing tongue of the recently scorned roger who has yet to learn how to deal with rejection . roger is the self-proclaimed prophet of the `` gender wars '' and is determined to teach his naive nephew how to cope with the opposite sex . this is as close to a one-man-show as you can get and campbell scott pulls it off in amazing fashion . this is a film that demands your full attention . the dialogue comes fast and furious and you really do n't want to miss a thing in this somewhat pessimistic but well contructed production

0	horrible family you care nothing for , and nobody you 'd want in your own , and that 's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional . even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her . hell , i really want to slap everyone on the cast , crew , and the writers . i bought this for 5 bucks , and it was n't worth 5 cents . these people are unsympathetic , unbelievable , and totally made up . the women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs . i bought the movie because of johnathan schaech ( based -- okay -- on his pretty face and his presence in that thing you do ) , but he 's not even in it that much . he 's better looking than all the girls in it too -- including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when alyssa dumps her . i fast forwarded through this after the first half , pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made dumb and dumber look like hemingway . in summation , if you like this movie , you have been dumbed down by the evil hollywood machine , and i suggest you check out good foreign films like a good marriage and beautiful scandals like valmont immediately . there is no excuse for liking unmoving , plastic dreck of this nature .
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	jeunet shot himself in the foot with this nonsense . i admire his attempt to create something cutting edge though . personally i did n't see the whole film , i walked out before the ending . audrey tautou is probably one of france 's least talented actresses . yes , i know we all loved her in jeunet 's single sucessful film amelie which is probably the only film of hers that most american 's have seen but please , the girl can barely act , has no presence and no joie de vivre . since amelie had it 's success tautou has appeared in no less than a dozen terrible movies , the foreign shelf at blockbuster is lined with them . i can hear the howls of dissent from the readers of this review right now , angrily clicking their disapproval of my review but i 've studied film at nyu and have seen virtually every french film good or bad since before the nouvelle vague . trust me on this one , this is a crummy film . a worthy effort at being cutting edge by jeunet perhaps , but still a crummy film
0	a director who has no idea how to film dance sequences ? an important song transmuted into god knows what ? mis-casting galore ? a female star without one iota of chrisma ? ( if she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions ! ) this is ... or should have been ... about the struggle to not only get a job on broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade . the all important role of shiela seems little more than an after thought . turned into a silly love story ( which does n't even play ! ) it is merely sad . sad ... and very , very bad ! ! ! ( the one star rating is because i had to rate it !
1	this movie not only has some creative fight scenes , it also has some very funny scenes as well . some scenes will have you laughing , and not like other kung fu movies that are stupidly funny , this one is on purpose . recommended highly !
0	this is only a portion of this episode . it cuts off in the middle of a sentence
0	when you decide to adapt a classic film you should take warning several aspects : has the story aged ? how has the suspense 's concept altered for the new audiences ? we know about the professed sympathy of cimino for rourke . we saw him in the year of the dragon . and somehow mickey does n't look credible as the distorted mind criminal . he is too rational and cold to represent that hard character . the illumination is another serious problem . the whole drama looks extremely theatrical : anthony hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and mimi rogers is inexpressive . elias koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that 's why the insipid dialogue . maybe david morse shows certain wild tendency . there is a rigidity in the dialogue . obviously you assist to the common places : the internal disagreements in the policy procedure . lindsay cruise is assertive in this role . but the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific . it looks too artificial and the viewer ' adrenaline simply is not emanated . the sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse . the music did n't help to maintain the suspense . it is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties . something similar happened with cape fear `s remake . the question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies . bogart looked extremely old for the role and rourke looked too elegant to be a convincing ex con . good entertainment for teenagers in a pop corn rainy weekend .
1	i love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together . when one 's off screen , you have the other to keep you entertained . and when they 're on screen together , it 's movie-making at its best . the plot itself leaves a bit to be desired . the film 's production was stop-and-go for so long , i heard that the director changed direction before it was finished . my guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie , particularly in regards to understanding benicio 's character properly . nonetheless , tommy lee jones and benicio del toro shine throughout . p.s . being an animal lover , i love that two leads in a movie are pro-animal too

0	not sure what is worse , the horrible script or the horrible acting . typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script . watching schneider dress in women 's clothes for an entire movie is just creepy . using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie .

( ... ) ! to all the naysayers , because graffiti bridge is sexy too ! this could be a silent film , and i would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute ( ... ) on screen ... everything about him is art . more than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he : an animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch ... cut it out you haters he is gorgeous ! !

1	for those who do n't know russian the title of this was ( Просмотрение k-19 - review of k-19 , thought i 'd be funny there ) this movie is not so much a combat movie it 's a what happened movie . the flagship of the russian navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 captians , yea that kinda do n't go over so well . they have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys . it is quite a gripping movie though . this is also one that needs to be bought not just rented
1	cagney 's startling performance as tommy powers , in william wellman 's public enemy , was to be expected . he was powerful when needed . gentle , with his short jabs of affection . and his fast-talking wit , whether in anger or in good-spirits , was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars . or was it to be expected in 1931 ? i did n't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star edward woods was supposed to be the lead , and that cagney was to play matt . at the last minute , in movie minutes , the roles were switched . and yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts . ( edward woods was incredibly underrated . does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938 ? he lived for decades after that . ) i wo n't rehash the plot here but i must pay homage to every cast member . jean harlowe -- what more can be said ? leslie fenton as `` nails '' nathan was a study in polished brutality . joan blondell as mamie was cute as a button with her wide-eyed perkiness , and sincere affection for her matt . donald cook could not have been better cast as the brooding , righteous older brother to tom . ( at points , he 's tougher than cagney 's tommy . ) beryl mercer as ma gets away with being so sweet without being saccharine . british actor murray kinell is just slimy enough to deserve his end , as the fagin-like putty nose . and last , but definitely not least , is robert o'connor as the paternal crime boss , paddy ryan , who is sincere in his care for his young apprentices . the uncredited child actors who played the young tommy and matt were priceless . now can anyone tell me who tony the waiter was : i loved his only line : `` pop ! bur-r-p ! pa-pop ! '' as for the dvd itself , well the sound was sometimes muddy , and the changes in film quality -- where they restored previously edited material -- are jarring . but so what ? you can see and hear every word in this masterpiece better than films made ten years ago that were sloppily transferred to digital . and the warner night at the movies ( 1931 ) was a brilliantly executed way to let us experience what it must have been like to go to the movies 75 years ago . this is a must-have disc for lovers of gangster movies or the classics

0	you talk about disappointed , this is the icing on the cake . all i hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was . not even close . whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong . i love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such . there are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70 's , but this is not one of them ... .seriously , do n't buy this . i do n't know why it is so highly regarded . the acting , story , and especially the music is el terrible ' . it 's like porn quality acting , a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a disney movie . it could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy , through in some disturbing music , and made the bad guys , well , more bad . it could be remade ( which i 'm usually against )

0	i have very mixed feeling about this tape . when i bought it , i did not realize it was for new mothers . i have cindy 's two previous workouts and love them both , so i purchased this without question . here are some random thoughts : -- i enjoyed the different length workouts . you do n't always have 45 minutes to workout , even if you are n't a parent . -- these workouts are lead by kathy kaehler , not by cindy like her other tapes . i found kathy uninspiring and uninteresting . cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the radu ones . she is more `` window dressing '' in this video . -- the amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly , which i found very annoying . -- the warm-up and cool-down are very , very short , even on the 40 minute workout `` c '' . -- the music will put you to sleep . i suggest hitting the `` mute '' button on your tv and listening to your own music . if you are a new mother or beginner , this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine . however , i believe you will quickly outgrow it .
1	this movie was made mainly to potray the cycle of jesus ' christ life , and what he when through , sacrificing himself for our sins . people may think that it may be too religous for their standards , but everyone has their own beliefs . i highly recommend you view the film it is very innovating and emotional . being a christian myself everytime i watch this film it uplifts my spirits and i hope it will do the same with yours
0	'clownhouse ' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor . while hearing of salva 's conviction when 'jeepers creepers ' came out , i never knew it had anything to do with this movie , nor had i ever heard of this in the first place . i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'it ' , and came across this weird little 'halloween'-like suspense tale . while the sex scandal never once popped into my head ( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid ) , i still did n't care for this too much , despite its pluses . like 'halloween ' , this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out , but sadly , it did n't really get to me . if i was about 9 or so , this would 've scared the hell out of me . i 'm not saying i hated this ; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images , but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children , it lost some effect for me . i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on , and it would 've been a creepier experience . horror movie fans should like this , even though i personally thought it would be better . the atmosphere is very , very creepy , and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way , but it just did n't do it for me . rent it first
0	yup , definately the worst halloween movie . come on , michael on a reality show ? ha ! what the f**k does that have to do with the series ? not only that , but the plot is completely pointless , the acting sucks , and dr. loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie ! not only that , but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary , and therefore comes off as pretentious . do n't get me wrong , i love gore in movies , horror or not , but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore . along with halloween 3 ( which actually had nothing to do with michael ) , halloween : resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series . there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed , but i 'm tired of typing , so i 'll let other reviewers explain why it 's so bad . bottom line , watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 3
1	i first saw this movie on tv in the mid 60 's . my wife and i laughed and snickered through the whole thing . then i saw it again , a few years later , while in vietnam . that was a real hoot with a bunch of guys watching and reacting . some 35 or more years later , i remembered it and just had to have a copy for myself . the entire movie , about how to cheat on your wife and not get caught , is chock full of cameos by readily recognizable stars acting out little scenarios as robert morse explains how to go about things to walter matthau . it 's a light no-brainer , full of amusing surprises , for aspiring cheats who will have no clue what happens at the very end
0	interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere . kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative , poorly composed , and add little or nothing to the experience . looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line . i 've lived in rural japan and it 's the most boring place on earth ( perhaps the intent here but hardly something you 'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only ) , you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all
1	the whole story would help us learn about the silent truth of female pleasure and sexuality . the plot , director , actors and wonderful actress in overall are much more better than other explicit sex movies such as `` lie with me '' and , especially , `` intimacy .

0	i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book . fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late . so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book . my fears were unfounded , the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie , even though it is tough to watch , i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and `` must watch '' . that is how good it is
1	i got this movie in a three dvd pack from a local dealer , it came along with the movies eaten alive and massacre in dinosaur valley . i 'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $ 15 dollars i spent on the three-pack . the movie , jungle holocaust , is an adventure movie in a different spin . i dont really consider this a horror movie , at least in the conventional sense . the movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography , the storyline is interesting and the acting and er ... scenes ... are engrossing ( to use a phrase ) . what i would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme ... a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings . communications are not what you would get off the local street corner , worldviews are nonexistent ( at least to the tribe in this film ) , so there is no connection except savagery . maybe this movie would have a greater tie with golding 's `` lord of the flies . '' a fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we , especially in first world countries like the us , have forgotten about . i would suggest `` end of the spear '' as a christian look at examining these prehistoric people . that film is n't a horror film , it is a christian film , but it is ( as i am a christian ) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory .
0	nazi 's secretly in la with a blimp and a whole army ? this guy has a jet pack that shoots fire out of it , but it never burns him ; it burns other things though . totally stupid and wierd . there is this super tall guy who is like soooo strong he bends people in half . jetpacked germans taking over usa . give me a break .
0	this has always been a favorite film of mine . the story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine . despite having the vhs , i wanted more and ordered the dvd . beware ! this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning , but it does not ! ! no subtitles in any language , no line 21 captioning . nor does it have anything else . `` interactive menus '' means scene selections . this plain vanilla release does n't even have a trailer . this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion 's gate reissued this dvd with nothing added . since i bought it online , i ca n't return it and neither lion 's gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from
0	recently i read about the revival of `` a chorus line '' on broadway . i 've never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it , so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek . well , somewhat disappointed here . i can only assume that the stage version , with its long-running reputation , must be better than this film . it 's not that the film is a total debacle , but it 's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable . even songs which i had heard before , like `` what i did for love '' , were reduced to barely a mention in the film . the film seemed to lack any real point . a bit of a yawner .
0	i agree with david thomson when he says few audiences in the west would be content to view an american epic composed solely of battles and their contexts . kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the west was entrenched with `` kagemusha '' and `` ran '' , he knew what ( american ) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about `` historical '' japan : kurosawa 's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what americans ( or westerners ) imagine about japan . he was not popular in japan ( where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded , hence the suicide attempt ) . i am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no `` ugly '' shot in either `` ran '' or `` kag '' - merely that there are more `` authentically japanese '' films out there to choose from .
0	i own both blu-ray and hd-dvd movies , and have been consistently dissapointed with all the hd-dvd 's . they just do n't compare to blu-ray . the hulk was not a very good movie to begin with , and the transer to hd-dvd was not impressive . picture quality was average at best , and the sound quality was also mediocre . i have yet to find any hd-dvd that is even comparable to the best of blu-ray
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved . i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse . jet li was pretty good , but how the hell do you screw that up . tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie , but it still turns out horribley . i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad , but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse
1	saturday night and sunday morning is very good social realist film . finney is fantastic as rebellious youth arthur seaton . having a sexual relationship with a married woman while also having a girlfriend portrays the sexual liberation of that time . sex before marriage was becoming more and more common , and this film represents this change in british society . it was a well made film for the time and even today has an appealing quality

0	i like westerns but in this film raquel welch and dean martin were down your capacities . ever will be nice look welch 's body but the film is only that .
1	this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an 18-year old , for a petty theft , to prison.one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his 8-year sentence.the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the 2 show him what he 's missed all within a 5-day period.jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance , while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances.other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days , in a brief apperance.this is a very good film but i would n't say it were great , for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again.it definitely is worth seeing though , at least for nicholson fans
1	the spice girls are the best ! and if you are a spice fan than this is the movie for you.i love i
0	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful , if opinonated ( remember hanoi jane ? ) , woman . i watched this as a teenager and despite the `` striptease '' this has to be one of her worst . hormones be damned , watching this was a waste of time . if you like fonda , try klute . she was an excellent actress -- - but no one could survive this mess .
0	i enjoyed this movie . i orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies . i would n't really call it a porn movie . it 's more of a movie with adult humor . i 'd give it an `` r '' rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today
0	the most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to `` night life '' which would repeat through the movie . this version credits the song , but it was replaced with some lame disco music . i am writing mgm to complain and demand a refund . even the trailer has the right music playing all through it . demand the original
0	i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004 . i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie , but it was really lackluster . the acting is wooden , the script is very lame , and worst of all , the action is n't very exciting . i expected a much better movie from director richard donner . there is a battle scene , and there are action scenes , but they just are n't exciting . when the action is n't exciting , you better have a good story . the story here is alright , but certainly not enough to save the movie . i do n't hate any of the actors , they are decent when they have something to work with . here they had nothing to work with , so they obviously did n't do too well this time . this really is n't worth your time . i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it , and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there
1	i can not believe that helen gurley brown would let them make this farce based on her book . now let see if we can straiten the out before it gets confused . sylvia and frank broderick ( lauren bacall and henry fonda ) are a couple in live that are always bickering as to if frank has a roving eye . helen gurley brown ( natalie wood ) writes her famous book . bob weston working for an unscrupulous magazine is tasked with getting the good on helen . he uses frank 's and sylvia 's problems pretending he is frank to accomplish the mission . throw in another physiologist a few women some tickets to figgie and florida . a lot of misconceptions and one of the best carmaker cycle , ice cream truck , cab , and etc . scenes ever made . will it all work out in the end ? will it ever end ? they try real hard to make it campy and use intentionally exaggerated acting . for some reason it works .
1	this arty quirky film about a new years eve gone wrong in the mid- 80s is one of my favorites . was the first time i saw kate hudson and she is so sweet and funny in this one . martha plimpton is a riot as the overwrought hostess with a failed party on her hands . ben affleck is actually semi-funny for once- he is trying desperately to get into someone 's pants- watch and see who he starts the new year with . courtney love and paul rudd are friends- she wants to be more but she scares him ... . indy gal j. garafolo is her dark and dismal chain smoking wisecracking self and fun again . dave chappel is the cabby who tells the tale . fun ! romantic comedy a guy will like ! -- .
0	so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing . well , anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing , awesome , good , or ok , has never actually seen salsa dancing ! ! i am a salsa dancer , and this movie was horrible ! ! ! i have seen amazing dancing , and good dancing . this was terrible dancing ! and there was hardly any salsa ! it was 80s dancing to salsa music ! that 's it . the only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner . other than that , it was just 80s dancing to salsa music . that 's it . if you want to see salsa dancing , i definitely do not recommend this movie . if you want to see horrible acting , and old 80s dancing , then i recommend this movie ... there was only one thing that i liked about this movie . the appearances made by tito puente and celia cruz . that was great to see , but not worth buying the movie for ... . oh , and the story line ? what was it again ? ? ? ? yeah ... i love movies , good ones and bad ones . but this one ? ? ? the worst movie i have seen so far ... to the best of my knowledge , there are n't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing . hopefully , someday , there will be
1	i wo n't spend a long time explaining why i like this movie ... it 's just mindless fun and that 's all it needs to be . a movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat-camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch , and while it 's not the funniest or clever done comedy it 's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them . plus , that blob thing is just too freaking cool
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
0	this movie , the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it , is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime . the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious . elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures . anita shreve 's writings never disappoint , read the book instead .
1	well written , well acted , and well directed , this is much better than 99 % of all films on tv or in the theatres . the only reason it is unknown is its adult content - marijuana smoking and romantic affairs , lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life . this is that rare bird , an intelligent film , for adults . my favorite line : joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow : `` you 're really interesting '' , after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible . it is not a 5 star film , like say `` witness '' , but it is an excellent small film . this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence
1	i just watched the second half of guarding tess on tbs . it 's now 11:30pm , and i am writing this review when i should be in bed 1 and half hour ago . nicolas cade and the old woman in the movie both turned in great performances . the story was lightly funny at first , but did n't really go anywhere . the relationship between the fbi agent and ex-first lady was strange , and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation , it was still weird . the climax came at the end , and was very entertaining , for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot . there is much meaning in the movie ; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life . i was touched by the movie . thank you . i should go to bed now
1	the gunfight at the ok corral and my darling clementine have many things in common . both of them are among the best westerns ever made . both of them had stalwart casts and scripts . both of them had great directors , sturges for gunfight and john ford for clementine . both of them did n't exactly tell the truth about what really happened leading up to and including the famous gunfight that took place on october 22 , 1881 . but while gunfight tells a great story and tells it well , clementine has a graceful , elegiac quality that permeated a lot of ford 's best films like the searchers and she wore a yellow ribbon . the little touches with henry fonda 's earp at one of his brother 's tombstone , the scene at the dance , and many many others that bore ford 's distinct talent for capturing the so-called little moments in life that usually add up to a whole lot . the rest of the cast , featuring ward bond as another earp , victor mature as doc holliday , and walter brennan as old man clanton , are stellar and contribute much to the proceedings . gunfight had a lot more of the story right , tombstone had an unforgettable doc holliday in val kilmer , and hour of the gun had a more sober , somber , mature spin on things , but for sheer beauty and poetry on film , no other version of the earp/clanton story is better than my darling clementine
0	sure the animation is interesting for a few minutes ( if you are interested in rotoscoping see waking life ) but the story and writing are horrible and bordem sets in within ten minutes . you will hang in for a bit waiting for somthing to happen but it wo n't so do n't bother with this movie , it 's painful to sit through ( and i love rotoscoping )
1	first of all , i would have to say is i am deeply moved my this movie . let me tell all of your lonesome dove fans something , do n't listen to there insults about this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! okay , first of all , we do n't have tlj nor angelica houston . those two characters were the major characters in ld next to gus . but , there is jon voight to play call . voight may not be the one born for call like tlj , but he still does an excelent job and no one except tlj could have played it better . barbara hershey plays clara . i think she captured the essence of clara and she did a good job . rick shroeder is back and he does a truly unforgetable job as newt . july johnson is back along with pea eeye . there are some new characters like former texas ranger gideon walker , gus 's daughter agostina vega , the villian cheeroke jack , and a man named isom who resembles the role of `` deets '' . although people say that this plot is the same , they are right , but that does n't make it a bad movie . just because mcmurty does n't write does n't mean it sucks . it captured the essence that the origianl caught . it had the same beautiful background music . there was a lot of action and adventure and the best part was , the story continued right after call buried gus . if you want to have an accurate depiction on what happens to the characters in the original , rtld definitly shows it . streets of laredo is nothing compared to this . this is the true sequel because it delivers the same joy to your heart just like the original . i reccomend this movie to anyone who loves ld and wants to know the continuation of the story . this movie is truly a western . the epic as big as the west continues ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	this is a classic gangster movie already , anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection
0	this sure sounded like a hot movie when i read the overview . a young woman curious about sex and trying to get herself off . boy , i sure was surprised at what this really is . a super softcore b-movie with terrible acting and almost no sex ! ! ! you want nudity ? sorry . but this movie does have worms , thats right , worms ! in one of the `` sex scenes '' a guy puts live worms into the womans private area . yeah , it 's that bad . stay far away from this one

1	being a big fan of anime comedy ( the intelligent , yet lame humor ) i was eager to see el hazard `` the magnificent world '' . because of the high price of the set , i had some hesitation ( because of some poor reviews on amazon ) . well , i have to say that the bad reviews are wrong . this dvd series was totally awesome ( although i admit it started a bit slow ) . i promise the more you keep watching , the better it gets . the plot is highly intelligent ( involving dimensional and time travel ) and the characters are very interesting ( with distinctive special powers ) . some say the humor in el hazard is juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , and seriously what good comedy is n't juvenile ? some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve a doomsday device ) , to which i respond `` do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star '' ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer did a great job . the dvd menu presentation is beautiful , and the box is very elegant too . hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on ebay ( beware of bootlegs ) . it 's very hard to find a good authentic set . the sequel `` alternative world '' which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . for my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend `` niea under 7 '' and `` his and her circumstances '' . animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4 total= 4.4 star
0	i can respect director adam marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different , but we already had the bs ft13th movie : part v. jason was n't the killer . technically , jason is the killer in this movie , but it 's not really . you 'll see what i mean when you see the movie , and it is worth a see , but by the 7th or 8th movie , they were movies for the fans . they stopped making them to be innovative by the 5th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience . adam marcus wanted to be innovative with jason goes to hell , and it does n't work . not for fans or an average audience . there 's nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like jason walking around and killing people , not to mention without the trademark machete . they could 've at least given these people a little personality with the machete , but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor . the introduction of jason having a sibling , niece , and now a great niece ( i think ? ) by the 9th movie in the series is a little too late , sorry . we would 've had to know about these people by at least the 3rd or 4th movie to make us care about their struggle . another thing : jason as a snake/demon creature crawling around the floor ? hmm ... i was n't under the impression that jason was really evil in the first place . let me explain : jason has been made out to be mentally/physically disabled . if ginny in part 2 was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater , than jason is n't evil at all , he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they 're responsible . so , jason as a wierd little hell creature does n't necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies . the design of jason 's actual appearances in the movie does n't make sense either . what happened between part 8 and 9 to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face ? why does he look fat ? where did his hair come from ? at least part 8 had some respect for the look and personality of jason , while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him , and not make drastic changes which do n't even benefit his appearance . adam marcus , i can respect you for trying to make your own movie , and yeah , it 's definately yours . do n't try and make your own movie the 9th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans , and do n't bs the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series . i 'd say , fans should see this movie just to see it . it 's worth the view and the surprise cameo at the end . *wink*
0	this movie is not worth sam elliot . i was very dissapointed , i will most likely thow it away
1	this is my favorite cardio video right now . because the video is only 30 minutes long , i can easily fit it into my day . i found the choreography fun and uncomplicated . i especially love the addition of plyometric moves and core conditioning to the cardio . i can feel those `` assets '' tightening up
1	bird , is a film about the life of jazz great charlie `` the bird '' parker . forest whitaker is doing a great job as charlie parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life , except one is lead to believe that `` chan '' was his wife ( in real life , she was n't ) . one negative thing i felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film . i think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance . another critisism is for a film about charlie parker , his talent on improvisation , his creativity could have been , and should have been emphasized more . there is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning , charlie does n't even remember the piece , or even the conversation that took place . this is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation . in real life , charlie parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time , with some additions here and there , givin it a new mood , new angle , new taste . this could have been shown . however , despite these minor shortcomings , i think the film is a very good one . for charlie parker fans , i also strongly suggest the book `` bird lives '' by ross russell
1	all the positive comments you read here about this film are true . this classic western stars john wayne , pedro armendariz and harry carey jr , along with a great supporting cast lead by ward bond -- the usual john ford suspects . ford strikes a balance between action and sentimentality , directing this simple story in a straightforward fashion with a great sense of style . this is ford 's first color film and cinematography by winton c. hoch looks really , really rich and with enough sand to make you wish you had some lemonade . duke really shines in this film -- just watch those expressions . restored to its original pristine 1948 35mm real technicolor glory , `` 3 godfathers '' is a natural for the christmas season . this heartwarming drama is a gritty , tender , timeless classic . a film the whole family can watch . this sleeper film in the wb/mgm catalog was way , w a y overdue on dvd in the us . but here it is , most welcomed and highly recommended ! ( i 've revised my original 2003 review to reflect this title 's availability on dvd . released with zero fanfare , i was first aware of its release when i saw a newspaper ad for it one week before christmas 2005 .
1	my two and three year olds have almost all the baby einstein dvd and this is one of their favorite . they beg to watch it and laugh out loud at the puppets . as usual , i am happy with the classical music , art work , and learning elements
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
0	i 've seen the phrase `` slice of life '' used many times to describe this movie , which makes me wonder - whose life is this a slice of ? certainly not mine , and not most people 's . the anniversary party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain , self-absorbed , jaded and rich beyond most people 's wildest fits of imagination . worse , there is n't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people , or at least most people who are fun to be around , do n't act the way these characters do . good films can be made about hollywood - in `` mulholland drive '' it 's kind of a dream world , both in the sense that it 's hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it ; in `` state and main , '' the self-absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement . `` the anniversary party '' is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters , but i ca n't imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who is n't also a bored rich prick . if this is truly a `` slice of life '' for the hollywood set , it is no wonder that so many films produced in hollywood are so cynical and shallow .
1	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie , but this movie is a definite exception . it `` possessed '' a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly , captivating scenery that is incredible , and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story . from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie . it piques the curiosity , it warms the heart , and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it . buy it , you wo n't regret it
1	not being a fan of westerns , i figured i would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on . the opening scene completely sucked me in , though , and the movie took off from there . the movie opens with eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend 's cattle . eastwood is left to die , only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail , where his story is verified by the judge , and eastwood gets a job as a marshal . his intention , of course , is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice . the action in the movie consists of eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt , all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare . the movie even manages to touch on moral issues , when eastwood wants clemency for an outlaw who helped him out , but is denied by the judge . the judge himself grapples with issues of having the ultimate power of law over the territory , not knowing the `` right '' action , and wishing for statehood so that he would n't have the power of god over criminals . the low point of the movie was eastwood 's romance with a beautiful , emotionally scarred blonde woman . there is a painfully slow picnic and lovemaking scene , which drags on while the audience wants eastwood to get back to his mission of rounding up outlaws . other than that , the movie is excellent .
0	steven seagal keeps making films . in 2005 alone , he made as many as four films , which itself sounds an amazing feat . not so amazing , however , if you see `today you die ' dreadful film with a dreadful title . the press material i managed to get at japanese theater in osaka ( yes , they dared to release it theatrically in japan ) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days . small wonder that none of the film makes sense , gives less actions than awful dialogues . steven seagal plays one harlan banks , ex-master thief who is retiring from his job . banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in las vegas , but because of the robbery committed by someone else , he is arrested and sent to a jail . is he framed ? of course , he is , but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail , and meets and enlists a help from someone named ice kool there ( played by treach ) , there is nothing to worry about . but i had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film . we see a glimpse of one orphanage ( briefly twice ) , but no one in the film seems to remember it . the film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of harlan sees ( played by mari morrow ) in her dream that portends death and danger , but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film . there is a detective played by sarah buxton , whose motive to get close to banks remains unclear , and nick mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as agent saunders . [ dull , dull , dull ] the most impressive part of `today you die ' is one car chase scene in las vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork . in fact , these scenes are recycled footages from one sidney j. furie actioner `top of the world ' starring peter weller and dennis hopper ( yes , i checked it yesterday ) . the rest of `today you die ' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between seagal 's character and others , which goes like : bodyguard : `` who are you ? ! '' seagal : `girl scout of america . ' naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket , who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles , which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `above the law . ' the film is strictly for the avid fans of seagal , but i am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year . i like his films in the 80s and 90s , and i admit `today you die ' is not as bad as `the foreigner , ' but that is n't saying much
1	this movie is about christian slater ( heathers , true romance ) who plays hard harry the pirate radio man of his pirated show . this is a movie that deals with rebellion and teen angst..kids who want to live their lives free of all the things they are imprisoned to do and they tune into slater 's show everynight to listen to him speak it loud and proud . samantha mathis ' ( broken arrow , that thing called love ) film debut ... this is number 1 out of the 3 movies her and slater star together in . cheryl pollack ( my best friend is a vampire ) is hotter then ever . slater 's flawless performance and unforgettable moments make this one a masterpiece and a movie not to be forgotten , one of the best movies of 1990 . also starring mimi kennedy ( tv 's dharma and greg ) , scott paulin , andy romano , ellen greene ( talk radio ) and billy morrisey ( severed ties ) co-star . note : seth green ( tv 's buffy the vampire slayer , party monster ) has a short but recognizable role in here and so does martin landau 's daughter juliet landau ( tv 's buffy the vampire slayer , ed wood ) .
0	an incredibly bad film , whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson , in ( and out of ) some skimpy outfits . she 's completely gorgeous , but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film . buy deathstalker instead
0	dolph lundgren ( universal soldier , blackjack ) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner , gina bellman . soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff . the 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead . another dolph lundgren stinker vehicle though lundgren ca n't act if his life depended on it . he couldnt pull of he-man and the punisher , he ca n't pull off anything else . gina bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast . there 's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex . directed by russell mulcahy ( highlander ) . bottom line is this actioner is a borefest
1	i lvoed this movie i have been looking for it for years . the story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great . it just wants to make you get up and dance
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
1	my son , being a hugh soccer fan liked it a lot . i liked the `` longest yard '' story line
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	i originally read the novel ( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware ) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled `` memory and mourning in post-war germany . '' i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel . it seems that the director wanted to make a more `` hollywood '' version of the film , and i think he succeeded . for instance , the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel , and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story . in general , the film has little to do with any of the original versions , and is far inferior
0	i just want to let potential marketplace buyers of salo that the seller : closeoutgoods and other amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated ( bootlegged ) editions of this movie and other criterion dvds . if amazon were legitimate , they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website . every potential buyer should report these crooks to the fbi and criterion
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	i think it is a great movie . i bought it for my grandson he loved it

1	tcm iii was a good movie.it had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.it lacked the essential characters , though.it would 've done better if they had brought chop top or drayton back to life.the film is about two friends headed down to florida from texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.we already know it was leatherface , and the two drive on.the next day , they come upon a gas station , where a crazy , yet funny gas station attendant named alfredo work.also making his appearance here as well is viggo mortenson as tex , a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.the two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods , pursued by the evr vigialnt leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.it gets the job done every time.as in the texas chainsaw tradition , they are captured and prepared for dinner.one of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on leatherface with the help of an veteran they met along the way.it 's an overall good movie and i loved it
1	his words to the jury , a petition for strength for them against great odds , for himself against greater odds , for a system sometimes blind to justice , and for the victim of negligence who has no voice , puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'the verdict . ' tv bytes and news reports of lawyers ' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best . and the courage and brilliance of `` brown v. board '' and `` heart of atlanta '' exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past . but once in while a movie ( 'mockingbird ' ) comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession : to do what is right , or even better , to do what is right against great odds . frank galvin , drunk , ambulance chaser , liar , failure , had that dream once but a mistake , an error of judgemnt , a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now , sucking on breath mints and bourbon , handing out cards , working for booze money . his old friend jack warden handed him a case , a no-brainer , a lovely irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead . the defendants ? a squeaky clean , chaired , lauded , published and handsome obgyn and . . . . the diocese of boston . and frank 's going to cave . hell . it 's the eve of trial and he 's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery . and then he prepares for the settlement conference with the dfense lawyer , james mason ( just positively brilliant ) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos . but a funny thing happens . lke marcellus ( burton ) winning the robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first aa meeting , frank 's not sure but something 's different . and he begins to wonder if maybe this time he wo n't cave . great , morbid , wry , ironic , gallows humor . warden says after the settlement conference , `` whadja ' think of ( mason ) ? '' galvin : he 's good . warden : good ? he 's the [ . . . . . ] prince of darkness . a cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief . i do n't know that there is a better trial movie . people say that newman lost but was n't robbed for the oscar because ben kingley was so wonderful in ghandi . he was robbed . 5 stars . larry scantlebury
0	the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980 's . it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series . it was a travesty to see optimus prime ( the greatest of the transformers ) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable of leadership . galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron -- he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic . why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie , they were forgettable . it amuses me that `` fans '' are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago . the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did . as a fan , i was insulted . perhaps these other `` fans '' have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage .
0	it really sucks , tried to download but it 's not able to be viewed in pc 's outsided the united states . crikey . i 'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly . whatta shame amazon dot com . let 's send a csi to yer headquarters
1	i kept passing by this one in the video store . i figured that i would have heard of it if it was any good , right ? wrong . it 's almost ten years old as of this writing , and i never heard of it , and it 's really good . i mean , really good , in lots of ways . it 's got characters i can really care about . there 's leaven , for one ( nicole de boer , aka dax of ds9 ) . she starts out as the stereotypical wimpy , screamy girl . then there 's quentin , who starts out the take-charge cop , the one you 're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth . just keep two things in mind . first , everyone changes over the course of the movie . second , wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring , just not a nice one . the way the characters change is another thing to like . this movie borders on the minimalist , and its fair to say they did n't spend a terrible lot on sets and props . the characters carry everything , and do it surprisingly well . this is n't a great movie in the sense of literary snobishness , but still a heck of a flick . the actors , plus the script they 're given to work with , really make the movie . another bit to like is that spending thing - they did n't do much . the actors are all good , but not in the gazillion-dollar class . sets and props are well done , but there 's not much to them . costuming could n't have cost more than $ 20 for each of seven actors . all this proves that money does n't make a movie : artists and artistic vision do . maybe money helps , but cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget . what 's not to like ? the ending . i 'll let you get there on your own . maybe that 's why this movie did n't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved . but , they did n't spend a lot , so i hope they all went happily to the bank anyway . they deserve every nickel they made from it . //wiredweir
0	i was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by christiane northrup in this jumble of a book . at a time when i needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body ; i turned to christian northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause . a wonderful combination if northrup had chosen to focus on menopause . instead she is all over the map , taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life . if i wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers , husbands , and daughters i could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life . instead , i sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock , as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life . if you are a middle aged woman who has `` stuffed your feelings '' all your life , and need help speaking up for your youself ; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice . but if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured , this book will shock you with its pettiness . i am quite new age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book ; but when i turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue ; that 's what i expect . i can only hope that northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication . i was embarrassed for her and returned it . i just do n't buy it in more ways then one .
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
1	this movie is a classic , especially for those who love tim roth
0	everybody i know loves this film . in today 's environment , when wkw is being hailed as the premier director from asia , and one of the world 's best , i do n't know how many really actually love the film , and how many do n't have the courage to state a contrary opinion . make no mistake , i think wkw is one of the greatest directors i have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like `` in the mood for love '' ( itmfl ) not be ? actually , his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like itmfl , but in his versatility . it is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both itmfl and chungking . well , his greatness notwithstanding , i ca n't stand this film . and no , i ca n't sit , lie , or do anything else with it either . so what is it about this movie which gets my goat ? the directorial style , and the cinematography . actually , i think parts of the latter are great , and the parts i do n't like are influenced by the former , so let me just talk about the former . wkw uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films , including `` happy together '' and `` fallen angels '' ( yes , i 've seen all of them , and hate almost all of them uniformly ) . the hallmark of this style is a very modern , staccato , piecemeal approach , stringing together relatively disparate ideas , scenes , or action sequences ( almost reminiscent of godard 's `` breathless '' , as the editorial review says here , though not quite ) . his style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example , the slow shutter speed effect . actually , this is one of his peeves , which even spills over to itmfl , where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb . having watched nearly all his films , and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism , and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme , i can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage . it gets used for dream-like sequences , for grounded reality ; for sentimental togetherness , for aloofness ; for tears , for laughter ; for thoughts , for action ; the list goes on . wkw similarly uses other weapons in his vast director 's repertoire to some bizarre effects , taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory . the above notwithstanding , let me round off by saying that if the kind of style i have delineated above appeals to you , then you should definitely watch this film , for outside of his jarring style , wkw has pieced together a great story and actors . as for myself , i will continue to watch every one of his films , living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love , or hate .
1	i have always been a fan . i really ca n't say much more . if you find a picture you can watch over and over again and it still remains fresh and new then there is no other option than to own that picture until you wear out the dvd
1	this is an ideal movie for home theatre . i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth , james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl . jason robards is utterly evil in this movie . i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one . the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection
1	i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister , over and over again . laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head , or when she accidently dyed her hair green , or when she waxes poetic about her `` bosom friend '' . it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old . i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old . it is a beautiful heartwarming movie , with gorgeous scenery , unforgettable characters , and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
1	i am quite amazed that there are no recommendations or comments on this picture from folks once lived life of malik in ex-yugoslavia . `` the boy 's very being does ( not ) becomes an expression of natural defiance toward the coming communist regime under tito and its spirit-crushing regime '' ( cited / re-worded from last comment ) - he is just stepping out of his childhood . on june 28th . 1948 ( what a coincidence - on a same date in 1389 turk army defeated serbian army on kosovo field and on a same date gavrilo princip in 1914 committed sarajevo assassination on austrian prince ferdinand - creating excuse for germany to start 1st . ( great ) world war ) members of stalin 's informbiro kicked yugoslavia out of membership of joint european communist party . that event gives birth to this movie . i would recommend much deeper research to interested party on happenings in yugoslavia ( 1945-1948 ussr -yugoslavia relations ) in order for that party to get a real feel for yugoslav society happenings after resolution of inforbiro ( bucharest 1948 ) . eastern block sanctions towards yugoslavia , few 5 year plans to swim out of those sanctions and hostile breakout from east produced deviant political society of 50 's yugoslavia . why am i writing all this historical rubbish ? it is an attempt to make you watch this movie again with ( now ) seeing malik as yugoslavia , his dreams as the yugoslavian nation dreams , his sick and dying ( first love ) girlfriend as ussr , his mother as tito , his father as all innocent yugoslav political prisoners from early 50 's , his father 's policeman jailer and friend as informbiro ( stalin ) , his father 's girlfriend as only good reason to spend some time in political prison ... .etc ... etc ... and then comment me back . or ask me for more info . i am finding this movie context extremely complex . being loaded with very hard to catch metaphors does n't help its easy understanding .
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..

0	by the time i came to this movie , i had already gotten there first three . up in smoke was fantastic , next movie was great , nice dreams was good , this was was pretty poor . they get pretty desparate at some points here , and they constantly repeat chracters we 've seen already . the low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals ( badly ) , the astronaut which is cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space , and then pretentds to jerk off at the end . also , when they got to `` harry palms '' masterbating champion , that was about as low and unfunny as you could get , just awful . all the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long , including the fake nightclub . the people laughing at cheech doing a redneck , had to have been payed actors . there are some good points ... not that many though . maybe the wrestling scene , and some of the scene with chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room . they do n't seem to do much in this . i wanted something different , which is what i got , but i did n't think it would be this horrible . these guys can do better .
1	`` i will not live without love . '' ~vincent van gogh the story of vincent van gogh 's life seems best told in his own words , complete with casual sketches , detailed drawings and famous paintings . in the spirit of `` crows '' in akira kurosawa 's dreams ( where we see the langlois bridge and crows in the wheatfields brought to life ) , we are entertained by visions of painting after painting . it is fun to watch akira kurosawa 's dreams after viewing this movie because then you recognize the paintings that were brought to life in a dream of pure visual delight . the café terrace , yellow house , fishing boats , bedroom at arles , starry night and sunflowers are some of the paintings featured , but there is an entire world of vincent van gogh 's art that is introduced with analytical letters written to his brother . in these letters he tells his brother of the art he is working on and his motivating influences all while we the viewer are entertained with the art , scenes from nature and the acting out of various scenes ( night café with pool table ) that eventually became paintings . there are fields of olive trees from olive trees 1889 and vincent 's letter speaks of the difficulty of capturing the colors in the soil and tree bark . when you hear the story of vincent van gogh 's life in his own words , suddenly he becomes so much more than a famous artist . his life is filled with tragedy and hardship , but he is also able to find stunning beauty through his love of philosophy and his view of the world seems to remain relatively positive right up until his death . he not only travels , he also lives with gauguin . the art shown after living with gauguin shows how being able to relate to someone like himself increased his creativity . he speaks of how he is a self-taught artist and how thankful he is that he was not trained and therefore had to experiment with paint to produce eye-catching effects . as he travels , his world expands and so does his art . he tries to capture his experience in 1,800 works during his life and while they ca n't all be shown in this movie , the director tries to capture as many beautiful scenes and pieces of art as he can in as many ways film allows . the creativity is delightful as actors take their places and then a picture emerges . `` how lovely yellow is . '' ~vincent van gogh he seems far from debilitating madness in his letters ( he talks about episodes ) and more inclined towards deep contemplations and philosophical discussions . he seems to be reaching out to a world that does not quite understand him all while trying to make the lives of those around him less lonely . the movie begins with his lofty spiritual goals and ends with his death . we learn so much about this artist , of his being homesick for the land of pictures and how he felt compelled to capture the daily activities of the peasants . the goodness in his heart truly shines through the darkness of his later days as he helps a woman most would have shunned and must live without the love of the woman he wanted to marry . through a weaving of philosophy and art , paul cox created a stunning and somewhat mesmerizing journey through the life of vincent van gogh ( 1853-1890 ) . i watched both the movie and the interview three times because the thoughts and experiences are so compelling . of all the movies i 've seen on an artist 's life , this is my favorite . what makes this truly memorable are the letters from vincent to theo read eloquently by john hurt . after watching this , you may find yourself looking for a book about vincent van gogh 's art or his letters in order to find some of the art shown in this movie or to expand your knowledge of his writing and philosophy . while many emphasize the madness , this movie emphasizes the struggle for beauty and the unending desire of the artist to capture all that he loves . ~the rebecca review
0	this picture is a mess of misused metaphors and confused imagery from start to finish . i was left scratching my head wondering who these people are and why they behave the way they do . forgive me for expecting the film to provide any answers . first the good news - if you like beautiful boys , ricardo meneses as the twisted sergio is one of the most gorgeous creatures to ever stand naked before a lens . despite the hopelessly confusing script , his acting ( such as it is ) is amazing , especially if you take into account his age ( 18 ) and experience ( his first film ) . it 's too bad he had to be `` discovered '' by a director who thinks nothing of making his audience beg for each scrap of insight , and pretentiously expects the viewer to read their own interpretation into whatever nonsense he sees fit to set up as his next scene . i wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt , so after sitting through one screening of this erotically charged but confused tangle of a movie , i sat through it again , this time with the directors commentary on . cheating , i know , but after shelling out all that money for the dvd i was hoping to gain some idea of what the hell was going on . i emerged from watching it the second time half in love with the beautiful young actor ricardo meneses , but with only a fraction of the respect i had for the director , joao pedro rodrigues , after my first screening . and that was n't much . sergio is a garbage collector for the city of lisbon . he works a graveyard shift with an assortment of other oddballs , and in between collecting garbage he has a series of sexual escapades that seem impossibly jaded for one so young . while other boys his age are swimming or surfing , he 's dressing up in a full-body suit of latex , having anonymous sex in men 's rooms ( including the most explicit act of fellatio i have ever seen in a non-pornographic movie ) and exploring s m adventures with any willing male he can find . just so you know how kinky he is , in one scene he masturbates in the shower while strangling himself with the shower-massage cord . you really have to wonder where all this imagination comes from , until you realize that the writer-director has been harboring some pretty extreme sexual fantasies about his friendly neighborhood garbage men . sergio has a female co-worker who is in love with him , but she 's busy having sex with the foreman , and sergio 's only interest in her is to tease her sexually and then play cruel jokes on her . he finally meets a man who does n't succumb to his charms , because he 's obviously straight . this was not the first or last thing in this film i did n't get ; when i was that age , and almost as pretty as sergio , i understood that some guys just could n't be had , so i shrugged my shoulders and moved on . not our sergio . he takes obsession to unheard of heights , especially for an 18 year old . he stalks the young swimmer , goes through his garbage , and steals his torn old swimsuit . of course unrequited sexual obsession in films is not exactly new - remember reflections in a golden eye ? in that film , made in 1967 and still considered by many critics to be one of the ten worst bombs ever made , the male object of marlon brando 's desire was almost as pretty as ricardo meneses , but that film had the advantage of a script that was at least coherent at times . in one of the first of many explicit sexual encounters in o fantasma , sergio , while walking his dog , comes upon a policeman handcuffed and gagged in the backseat of a patrol car . he proceeds to masturbate the cop to orgasm , leaving him tied up in the car and then running off to work , where he spends the rest of the night sniffing his hand and licking the residue . i was hoping that the director 's commentary would maybe explain how and why the cop is tied up in his own squad car , but his sole comment on the soundtrack is , `` you do n't understand in the film why the cop is handcuffed '' . excuse me , mr. rodrigues , but i did n't understand it in the audience , either . sergio 's only tender scenes are when he takes care of the dog , a mascot of the sanitation workers . in one scene , sergio is busy cleaning the dog dishes and doghouse with a hose , when he turns and sees the foreman standing in the door . he pushes past , their faces register some indications of conflict , and then the foreman shuts the door . the director 's commentary on this action is , `` the door closes , and you know what will happen , but you do n't see it '' . uh , no , i 'm afraid the relationship between sergio and foreman is the least developed of all the underdeveloped relationships in this film , so what will happen next is anybody 's guess . not that i really cared ; sergio is the only character in the script whose personality is even partially explored , and all we ever really learn about him is that he 's sexually compulsive and kinky to the max . the picture goes on endlessly , with sergio refusing to let go of his obsession for the young surfer / swimmer , until he has the most excruciatingly slow breakdown ever recorded in a movie . at the same time , what little there is of coherence also breaks down . the director 's commentary infuriated me even more when toward the end , after spending most of the commentary praising the cooperation , beauty , talent and maturity of his young lead actor , he proclaims , `` it is cruel to say it , but he wants to continue acting , and i think he will not act again . i will not use him in my next film ... it 's like his body has been used up '' . i have n't had the benefit of seeing anything else by mr. rodrigues , but if given the choice of viewing mr. rodrigues ' next film or ricardo meneses next appearance i think i 'd opt for the beautiful boy any day . after botching the attempted kidnapping of his beloved obsession , sergio takes off to spend the balance of the film wordlessly running . the final scenes treat us to a guided tour of the sights , sounds ( and by way of commentary ) smells of a garbage dump . as sergio wanders through the dump clutching a live rabbit he finds among the garbage ( `` i saw the rabbits there '' says the director on the commentary , `` so it 's believable '' ) the director , grasping for a final metaphor , remarks `` he is like a cross between a bug and an insect '' a comment that seems to me to be a cross between the idiotic and the insipid . he then ends this drivel after the slowest twenty minutes of film i 've ever sat through by more or less telling us he did n't really know how to end it - like i had n't figured that out a full ten minutes before the end credits started running . as sergio continues to stumble on into the dawn before the final fadeout , the director says , `` i could bring him back to the city , but that would not make much sense '' . the idea of a scene that might not make much sense did n't prevent him from filming the other 90 minutes of this drek - i dare say he should have gone for it .
0	i might have enjoyed this movie more if they had n't gutted the book , which was a pretty good read . the best character in the book , fbi special agent pendergast , is n't even in the movie , and new york city police lt. d'agosta is just a comic caricature of the book 's character . another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything . if the purpose was to create a moody , scary atmosphere , they went way too far . see if you must , but do n't expect too much
1	i am serious ! what is going on ? i look at myself now , and do not recognise the guy in the mirrow ... he likes baseball and football ( american football ) , he eats hotdogs and humburgers ... who is he ? have no idea ... but the worse part - he loved this movie , and he fell in love with ingrim bergman for her unbeliavable performance in it . forget walter matthau , forget goldie hawn - they allways good ! but the way ms. bergman rediscover for us the story of love ... when you not 15 anymore ... she really touched my hart
1	we had the pleasure of seeing this the other night in san francisco at the castro theater , in dual projection 3-d against a silver screen . flimsy little glasses were provided to help blend the images poppped out onto the screen by the twin projectors . it must have cost a mint just to stage this show , but happily the event was packed with like minded creature lovers and everyone cheered , ooeh and aahed as soon as the brazilian diggers uncover , in a solid block of limestone , the skeletonized hand of a long dead creature , its webbed fingers beckoning right out over the audience 's heads ! it was a powerful punch to the solar plexus and a reminder that even archaeology has its thrills . the 3-d effects are more subtle than you 'd think . there 's nothing else , for example , as in your face as the ping pong ball that jumps repeatedly off the screen in house of wax . here , director jack arnold seems to be trying really hard to give flesh and blood to his two pprotagonists , richard carlson and richard denning , showing them off as the brain and the emotions , while julie adams plays sensitively and sympathetically to both . is she sort of trying to figure out which side of the bread her butter 's on ? the doctor tells her that she repaid any debt she owed richard carlson long ago -- she does n't owe him anything anymore her playing pygmalion to her untutored galatea . so in a way it 's hard to tell upfront which man she 's going to wind up with . the creature i found sympathetic in a way , but i think the performance must be docked a wee bit because of the different actors playing the part . up on top it 's the sensitive , tortured ben chapman , while down below , ricou browning 's frisky balletic style . like harold land underwater , makes him seem more fancy free . to top it off julie adams and ben chapman were there , discussing the complex dynamic of the `` beauty and the beast '' scenario producer william alland dreamed up on a south american jaunt with orson welles . miss adams has got to be in her 70s surely , and yet she is still heart-stoppingly gorgeous and lovely . she spoke to anyone who approached her , seemingly grateful to the fans who have kept the `` creature from the black lagoon , '' and the woman he loved , alive in cultural memory for more than fifty years now . it was an enchanted evening -- in dual projection 3-d no less

0	like so many hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s , when america 's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine . see the shawshank redemption , see dead poet 's society , see with honors -- filmdom 's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades . naturally , this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend . in regular hollywood fashion , nurse ratched ( the chief antagonist ) and the cuckoos ' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is , of course . unlike most fare of this sort , it is at least very competently crafted ( the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all ) , which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise . -- m. cooper
1	i purchased the dvd for my adopted chinese grandaughter ... the whole family loves it .
1	after reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90 's thriller i decided that it deserved at least a rental . i must confess that i am glad that i happened to stumble upon this movie on amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be . the screenplay was very put together , the plot setting were intriguing yet mysterious the killings ( or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy ) visuals are quite impressive for it 's 500,000 $ dollar budget . now , the only real complaint that i can say about the film is that the acting is horrid . now dont get me wrong not all of the acting was that bad but i would be lying if i said that most of the actors were okay , the truth is that most of them had very little experience and that made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an elite horror film . i think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors . i thought that david hewlett played david worth ( the architect ) acceptably and i also thought that nicky guadagni 's performance as helen halloway ( the doctor ) was pretty good . other than those two i thought that the acting was very lightweight . the guy that played quentin ( the cop ) was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important ... also i thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the autistic boy ( or man it was some what hard to tell ... ) . i know that i keep going on and on about the acting but i cant wonder away from the truth to much . the concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant , the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease . despite the acting i was heavily impressed and the film was overall very good . grade : b+
0	no , it 's certainly not as good as the first one , but i did enjoy some of demons 2 . the beginning is cool enough , with the demon 's resurrection and it 's gaining access into sally 's apartment via the tv set . the tension and dread seem to build quite nicely . that is , right up to the scene where the kid-demon 's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic , rubber demon puppet ! ugg ! it reminded me of those stupid monsters in ghoulies , hobgoblin , or some other wretched '80s mess ! the apartment building setting was interesting , but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few , precious bursts of action we actually get . i did like the weightlifter folks in the gym . they were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders ! the battle in the parking garage was ok too . maybe i just expected d2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing ...
0	maybe it 's just me , but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie . it 's an incredibly small production ( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film ) , with very low production values . norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker , but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest , either . ( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie . ) if you are an alan rickman fan , chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them . and dark harbor is just one more of these . do n't let the promise of a `` nude scene '' convince you to buy this movie - honestly , alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on . as far as the movie is concerned , the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging . it is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off .
1	at this moment in our history we need all the input about the multiple facets of the hideous war machine that has an apparent strangle hold on every country on the planet . in this russian meditation , 100 days before the command , we are shown the behind-locked-doors view of youth preparing to become soldiers and leaders of soldiers . on the surface the director 's eye seems to be telling us that 'boot camp ' for these very young appearing boys is no more than a summer camp experience . but then he gradually shows the darker , terrifying side of what preparing these innocents for war produces - suffering , self-doubt , death , alienating behaviour , dreams and nightmares . there is an incredible sense of innocence in the eyes of these youth , and a groping for comradery that lightly brushes on eroticism . the multiple nude scenes seem to be offending more people than the russian censors , but they are some of the more tender and tangible scenes in this meandering film about questioning our place and mindsets in the propagation of war leaders . of note , in this very russian film , the music used in the background is all bach - excerpts form the passions , cantatas - instead of works by russian composers . this adds another dimension to this apparent 'paean ' for world peace . this film is not for everyone , especially not for those who still have difficulty with male nudity ... ... ..
1	i bought this dvd for my sister , a fan of the movie . she made me watch it with her on christmas . the touching topic , the much-missed actors starring in the movie and the easy pace of the story left us feeling content , refreshed and ready for more pumpkin pie
1	it 's time to turn off your brain and have fun . the faces are familiar and make them part of the family . a funny , up movie is good for whatever ails you
0	will someone please produce a dvd/vhs re-make of diva with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film ! ? i was so excited to finally find this movie , but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans , that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it . i hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they 'll re-issue a quality dvd and/or video soon
1	i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on ( it 's been some time now ) and i plan to buy it . waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father . i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter ( that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon ) . a heartbreaking , beautifully acted and must-see film . rings true to life . they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore , and it 's a shame
0	this movie sucks it sucks donkey balls . if you enjoyed this movie you should be shot you should be shot in the head . die you evil fans of this horrible movie . who the hell would put the time , money and effort into such a peice of junk . i suggest that everyone who was involved in the making of this `` movie '' should be rounded up and sent to consentration camps . i think this is the major problems of this world . this movie is the reason war exists . this movie is the reason people hate each other . please read this review and never watch that peice of crap
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
1	this is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s . jessica lange truly deserved her oscar and tommy lee is excellent and of course powers booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies . i ca n't even tell you how many times i have seen this movie and i will watch it again and again .
1	truely speaking , this is a very hilarious episode . must see for every one
0	some people praise `we do n't live here any more '' as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples , tired of lies , not really knowing what to do . it is also true that naomi watts and mark ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting . the film as a result looks like a filmed version of some john updike novels ( actually it is based on two shorts by andre dubus , whose `killings ' became `in the bedroom ' ) . but sorry , updike is not my favorite author , and the film 's touch is too desultory for me . no , `desultory ' is not the only real problem because i remember i was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `in the bedroom . ' the real flaw of `we do n't live here any more ' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters . mark ruffalo 's character jack is having affair with naomi watt 's edith and jack 's wife ( laura dern ) already suspects , or knows that his husband is cheating . but the affair means here uninspired , clichéd sex scenes between edith and jack among the woods in oregon , with naomi watts and mark ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `fatal attraction . ' edith husband hank ( peter krause ) teaches creative writing , and has just one book published . the alcoholism of laura dern 's character is suggested in the most obvious way ( you know what ) , but in the first place why did n't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché ? among these recycled materials , there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention . it is the brief , but efficient study of the children in both families , and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart . these clever , insightful moments , however , do not last long in the film , for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in america . we do n't want any big surprises , or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning . it is true that `we do n't live here any more ' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in america , but the film goes nowhere from there , missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters .
1	all bow down to the producers at criterion , who have done an outstanding job of bringing to dvd one of the best rock films ever made , gim me shelter . the film itself has been reviewed to death over the past thirty years , so i wo n't do that here . i will , however , let 'cha know that beyond criterion 's beautiful , vibrant , remixed , remastered presentation lies a world of wonderful extras : 1 ) commentary by filmmakers albert maysles and charlotte zwerin , 2 ) audio material from the four-hour day-after program broadcast by ksan on december 7 , 1969 , 3 ) three different trailers for the film , 4 ) trailers for other maysles brothers films , 5 ) 5.1 , 2.0 stereo and dts sound mixes , 6 ) outtake footage including performances of `` oh , carol '' and a nice acoustic `` prodigal son '' , 7 ) a studio mixing session with the band for `` little queenie '' , 8 ) an extensive stills gallery , 9 ) a huge book with much material on the film and the filming , and lots more . gim me shelter is a must-own for your video rock library . thank you , criterion
1	we were amazed that this film was n't an award winner . it is an excellent film , and you might even see some style similarities between howard roark and frank lloyd wright .
1	most serious directors and actors aspire to a level of professionalism that seems effortless to the point of casual . like the best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs with a nonchalant jog and a flick of the wrist . on the other hand , kinski and herzog want you to feel every moment of effort , every muscle twitch , the oppresive heat , the mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution , the dangerous waters , the sleepless nights . watching this movie , i can easily imagine the furious arguments and sullen bitterness of men pushed to their creative and physical limits . they suffered to make this movie and they want you to know it . herzog 's actors tolerate conditions and exertions far beyond the call of duty and for what ? to make a flick . aguirre 's men tolerated far more for gold most did n't live to see . at the heart is the titular character , played by kinski as a wild eyed wraith more dead than alive as he descends into an utter madness as a refuge against the ordeal and death he presides over . to know anything about kinski is to know that aguirre is not a terrible stretch for him . if anything , his performance is more brave in its selfexamination than creative in its acting chops . herzog , for his part , seems to be a good old-fashioned meglomaniac as he appears to derive great satisfaction from pushing his cast and crew far beyond normal limits and treating them like little toy people so he can be a rich famous director . he has a singular vision and is determined to see it on the screen , no matter what . he is a throwback to the american studio director/petty tyrants like john ford , alfred hitchcock ( a gentleman tyrant who referred to actors as cattle ) , michael curtiz and many others . herzog is determined to control and kinski resists control and their collaborations are the output of a kind of two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker . aguirre is almost two movies . one is a brillant study of madness and ordeal and the other is an equally fascinating , if unintentional , documentary of two difficult half mad professional collaborators making a great movie often in spite of themselves
0	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky , i found `` altered states '' , his first novel , terribly disappointing . the film was , in my view , utterly dismal . the only reason i would recommend it , would be as an example of `` hack movie making '' . if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell , both would be relegated to obscurity
1	the art of farming is by far the oldest , most time-honored tradition . it is the ideal way to make an honest living , raise your family away from the madness of the city and gain self-satisfaction by doing something that really matters . `` the river '' effectivly portrays the plight experienced by many american farmers during the 1980 's economical recession . flooding , forclosure and overdue bills were just a part of life for those most discouraging and undeniably frightning of years . farm-friendly legislation has been passed in recent years so farmers can apply for disaster relief , equipment loans and bankrupcy loans . the goal is to keep the family farm as part of american culture . `` the river '' was shot in northwestern tennessee near kingsport , bristol and johnson city and also in birmingham , alabama . a 400-acre parcel of land alongside the holston river , in tennessee was cleared and turned into a real working farm in just four weeks . the flood scenes were produced in conjunction with the tennessee valley authority using a dam upriver which was slated for repairs . the scenery in the movie is absolutly breathtaking . the mountains , fields and river all seem to blend into one big beautiful picture . `` the river '' was the third in a trio of farming-based movies that year . the other two are `` country '' , with jessica lange and `` places in the heart '' with sally field
0	i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place , perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story . however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly ( in a stupid way ) .the action scenes were terrible . i recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies .
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman . if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups , this is the series . i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean . that is hard to do . the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys , they are that good . in my humble opinion . you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit .
1	guarding tess would n't be so much fun if it were n't for the presence of the unflappable shirley maclaine as the former first lady who gets nicolas cage for her secret service bodyguard . cage is equally effective in his role . he hates his assignment and he and maclaine do n't get along well at all . but when the president himself ( voiced by director hugh wilson ) insists on their pairing , what can cage do ? other than the expected pivotal kidnap plot , there 's not a whole lot that goes on , but the film surprisingly shows what it must be like to surrender your privacy due to your notoriety and maclaine 's attempts to find such private moments is poignant . a solid supporting cast makes it work too , although edward albert 's character of maclaine 's son is rushed over too much to bring any significance to the role . all in all , a pleasant enjoyable movie
1	this is an excellent hour . i did not always like the spice girls , i fell in love with them when i read real life , real spice , their book ; and found out they were real people . since then i have been really trying hard to get to know them , which is real hard in the u.s.a . this hour of girl power documents their early years , it includes full length vesions of `` wannabe , mama , say you 'll be there , 2 become 1 , who do you think you are '' also preformances in london , tours in hong kong , new york , l.a . and at the brit awards . this video will help you catch up , with the best female band of all time . the video also includes exclusive behind the scene footage . it 's the closest you can get to the spice girls without meeting them . rock on spice girls
1	i really like these tapes . the first one is pretty easy , but it is very relaxing , and i use it on days when i want to take it easy . the second one is somewhat challenging , and the third one is even more so . these tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one . tracy rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable . i also like how they ( ganga white and tracy ) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced
0	i think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to pulp fiction . as if . beyond minor superficial similarities - i dont see it . le samurai is one of the most boring films ive watched recently without turning it off . in retrospect i wish i had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull . imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot , but the main character had no charisma . or if alphaville ( the film not the treatment ) was more 100 times more boring . le samurai makes tokyo drifter seem like a thrill ride . i was not impressed by this film on any level . if you are into being bored . or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance , this is the film for you
1	moore shows us that outsourcing was big when clinton was president . he makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees . big one will open your eyes
0	this was a critically lauded film , so when i went in , i had high expectations . roger ebert himself called it a masterpiece . i saw it , and it was certainly interesting , but i immediately forgot about it right after i left the theater . there really is n't much depth here . it 's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something , then after it wears off , you do n't even remember how you felt afterwards . i remember a scene where a cow is blown up , but other than that , it 's hard for me to remember anything about it . it ultimately was very ordinary , and not a really deep film about war .
1	cult classic ... this is a loners movie ..i think we have all had times in our lives when we felt like kowalski..thats what makes this movie so authentic ... what ever happened to barry newman ..does anyone remember `` petrocelli '' ..the tv series barry newman played a private detective and he was building his home block by block himself in the nevada desert ? .
1	i much prefer irony to tragedy , and after blue i was not sure what to look forward to with white . i wound up liking white a lot . movies about `` the human condition '' are , for me , almost invariably obvious . while this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love , impotence and the power of performance , revenge and a circling back to love , i thought it was handled with such off-hand , dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film . in a way , it struck me as an amuse-bouche , one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses . the movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness . zbigniew zamachowski does a masterful job as karol , a sad sack if there ever was one , who gradually shows determination as well as obsession . i suppose one must just accept obsession as an unexplainable plot device in a movie , but dominique got off to a very unsympathetic start . she 'd wilt most men . karol 's obsession with her seemed a bit unreal . i found karol developing into a resourceful , intelligent guy whom i began to admire . dominique , though , did n't seem to change much . after all she put karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most of the time -- i could n't empathize much with karol , but simply accepted things as the reason why i was enjoying the movie . i could n't help thinking that if karol had just had a few viagra handy , none of his troubles would have begun . but then i thought about dominique 's essential characteristics , and i think that karol would be better off with somebody new . i do n't see a future for them . one of the things i liked a lot about this movie is that it kept me guessing . was it going to be a romantic comedy , or a black comedy or some kind of excruciatingly dull exploration of sexual inadequacy ? was karol really just a sad loser when he seemed sort of resourceful in a sad , funny way ? what was he trying to do with his property purchase ? where did dominque fit in or was this just a cameo with delpy ? was something sad going to happen after i 'd figured out it seemed to be a combination black/romantic comedy ? i like a movie that i ca n't quite see the end to . people have said that this movie is the equality part of the trio . i saw this movie as a clever , bittersweet struggle for dominance , not equality , and laced with a little revenge . i thought it was a sweet , bittersweet , clever movie
1	i was fortunate to see this movie in a cinematic retrospective show . i had already seen and liked `` ben-hur '' `s 1959 version and was curious and keen to observe this earlier product . i really was n't prepared to see such gem ! if for nothing else , the sea battle scene alone merits viewing the movie . in some ways the story line is better developed in this film than in the more modern one , even if the acting , as in all silent films , applies some exuberance to the corporal demeanor . there are also a couple of surprises : some scenes are filmed in color enhancing the realism to the passion ; the chariots race is realistic in extreme and the already mentioned sea battle involves hundreds of extras . director fred niblo reached his peak ; he was an experienced film maker , having conducted major actors and actresses as rudolf valentino , douglas fairbanks and lillian gish . he was also author of first versions of films that will be remade in the future as `` the mark of the zorro '' ( 1920 ) , `` the three musketeers '' ( 1921 ) and `` blood and sand '' ( 1922 ) . ramon novarro also gives his best as judah ben-hur before entering his path into oblivion . francis bushman fleshes his messala with a mussolinian air and overacts a little . very good film for all time cinema lovers ! reviewed by max yofre .
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	this item is supposedly titled `` ufos : the first encounters . '' it is , however , an episode about reincarnation . it is incorrectly labeled . do not purchase unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation
0	the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980 's . it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series . it was a travesty to see optimus prime ( the greatest of the transformers ) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable of leadership . galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron -- he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic . why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie , they were forgettable . it amuses me that `` fans '' are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago . the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did . as a fan , i was insulted . perhaps these other `` fans '' have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage .
0	i admit , i have n't finished this book . a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia . i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards , interest in astrology and angels . granted , i am not a firm believer in just `` the hard facts '' but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !
0	as ex-infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable . this low budget movie spoils the book . a supposed highlight is the sas field craft , but that 's a bad joke . the sas troop crowds around for camera shots , all the while talking loudly if not shouting . bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best , the sas . the fire-fight sequences are passable . the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it . the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field , should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot , making it unsuitable for many audiences
0	the fridays gang steals some diamonds . mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be . his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve . plus , everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin . whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on tbs or something
1	all 3 wiwag are excellent . this is more than just a well put together documentary . its very moving because of the footage , narration and music . you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball . it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's . after watching this , you wish that things today were as they were back in those days . not just baseball or sports , but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds
0	the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language . this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated . it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting . dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful . falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality . i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love
1	the environment of this movie was so unusual for me , since i know virtually nothing of the maiori culture , i was enthralled with this movie
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	yes , this movie is kind of unrealistic but so what . and just to re-clear up the bike thing . it was n't a coaster brake bike like you had on your old banana seat bike when you were a kid . it 's a track bike with a fixed gear . which means the pedals spin as long as the rear wheel spins . and backward pressure slows your speed but does not completely stop it.that why he always jumped off the back and grabed the seat when he wanted to stop quickly . that is also why anyone crazy enough to ride a track bike on the street usually has a front brake installed . look at the scenes where he is freestyling in his apartment . he is pedaling backward . this can only be done on a fixed gear . no coaster brake . if you look really closely at some of the scenes you will be able to see different bikes . like when bacon rides down the stairs , you can see the bike he 's on has brakes . obviously for the stunt . but i really like this movie . i 've been a messenger and i always wanted the place i worked to be like that movie . we never went outside and freestyle in the street while the boom box played . and hot girls never gave me their phone number . but we get to see lawrence fishburne as voodoo when was still know as larry . and that 's worth the 13 bucks right there
1	even now the quality of music in this musical movie is excellent . this brings back memories from my childhood : ) great version of a classic
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	a selfish , stupid woman engages in white collar crime , and goes to prison for her misdeed . i say stupid , because she could have paid a modest fine and gotten away with her crime , but chose instead to gamble with her and her family 's future by trusting her lot to a jury of her peers . they judged her as harshly as i did . once in prison , she is exposed to life 's realities , possibly for the first time in her wretched existence . seeing various and sundry sordid occurences beyond her middle class ken , she decides to meddle in the affairs of others ( possibly motivated by petty jealousy , since she is n't getting any drugs or sex from the handsome male prison guards ) . to make a long story short , her rabble rousing is eventually heard in washingtonm d.c. , a senator takes more than a passing interest in her , and her sentence is commuted to a home curfew . i guess the moral of the story is white collar criminals are better suited to country club prisons . if you have nothing whatsoever to do , your dvd player is broken , and you do n't feel like cleaning the oven , this movie might possibly entertain . otherwise avoid at all costs
0	this movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed-in-the-wool zombie fest . if you were like me , who is n't well versed in the foreign horror movie scene , this movie was entertaining , but not what i 'd consider something i 'd add to the library ( thanks netflix ) . one thing i 've found with italian horror movies ... ..they spend alot of effort on visual trippery , seems they want every italian movie to be an art film , and this is no exception ( same goes for the argento films of the past ) . its not a bad thing , just a distinctive style that you either buy into , or you do not . an awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason : ) a little bit of sex ( again , in that erotic italian artsy style ) , a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick , and a whole lot of strange , implausable things happening . and then eventually , the movie ends . the story is definately more love story / dark comedy..its entertaining , has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film , because its really not .
0	while a wonderful story , this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch . a bit hard to understand why the child of two english parents would speak like she 's from new jersey ! i could n't watch the end of this it was so bad . recommend you see another version .
1	i was skeptical when i first heard they were making a `` freddy vs jason '' movie . the chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high . after viewing the film , however , i was pleasantly surprised . the plot makes a twisted kind of sense , the performances by robert englund and ken kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic , and the special effects are top-notch . as a nightmare on elm street fan , i was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous nightmare movies . i was , however , intrigued by the jason backstory and scenes . since then i have become a fan of the friday the 13th pictures also . if you like either franchise , you will most likely enjoy freddy vs jason . even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer
1	this retelling of the snow white and the seven dwarfs was actually based on a script that billy wilder wrote before immigrating to the united states from germany , but it was only after the success of the disney version that a demand was created for it . the enormously versatile howard hawks ( quite literally the most versatile director in film history , the only director to have mastered and/or created five or six genres ) took the script and turned it into one of the last great pre-ww ii comedies . the story is simple : a group of monkish scholars living together in new york city are writing an encyclopedia . one of them is writing about slang , but being unfamiliar with contemporary argot begins research his topic by talking to people outside his normal range of acquaintance . he runs into gangster moll sugarpuss o'shea , who takes advantage of the scholars to move in with them in order to escape the police , who want to talk to her to implicate her guy joe lilac . while hardly snow white , she certainly managed to stir up their lives . the film is made wonderful by a number of things : wilder 's clever script , hawks typically deft direction , a solid performance by gary cooper , but most of all by a scintillating job by the overwhelmingly alluring barbara stanwyck and a stellar collection of veteran character actors playing the seven dwarves . all the latter are great , but special mention has to be made of richard haydn ( who excells even beside the others , with his extraordinary overpronounciation of everyday words ) , oskar homolka , and s.z . sakall . there are few more delightful collections of character actors in any hollywood comedy . i personally prefer barbara stanwyck to any other actress in hollywood history . she possessed an emotional immediacy that no other actress could approximate , and while her skills were perhaps a tad below those of someone like katherine hepburn , the latter never managed to match her fire and passion . and she is so sexy ! i grew up watching stanwyck on the big valley , so when i first started seeing her great roles from the thirties , forties , and fifties , i was absolutely stunned at how sexy she could be . she was attractive , yes , but sexier than she was attractive . and she was never sexier than she was here , with the exception of her role the same year in the lady eve . another reason to see this film is the appearance of gene krupa in the early nightclub sequence . krupa had , of course , been with benny goodman throughout the thirties , so this was very early in his career as leader of his own band .
1	i saw this movie when i was a student of latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of plautus 's plays brilliantly . later , i saw a stage prodction which i liked as well . but no one can replace zero mostel . he is one of the most naturally funny men in the world . this is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun . it is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time .
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode . not only did i get charged , but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge - i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund . once it finished downloading , it did n't play anyway . i gave up .
0	quick ... what 's not in widescreen and has no special features ? that 's right - megalodon ! sixty feet of prehistoric terror - or so claims the box art . this film may be about a shark , but the production is all about frankenstein . seen jaws ? how about the abyss , alien , reptilicus , deep blue sea , deep star six or leviathan ? then you 've seen most , if not all , of megalodon . it 's all here - the high tech multi-billion dollar drill site , a small , but the `` best at what they do '' crew , the ill timed major storm ( snow and ice ) , an ill crewman , a lost world filled with lost fish stuffed with lost magalodons , the standard crew roundtable scar sharing scene , a spunky blond girl reporter and her husky semi-comic cameraman . tiny one man ( one woman ) subs , a helicopter crash , several `` tragic '' deaths all capped off with a whiz-bang explosion at the end which solves most ( but not all ) of the problems . megalodon takes no chances by leaving nothing to the imagination . it simply takes no risks - which is odd since it tries so hard to move in another direction all the time . there 's a good story here blocked by a very large shark . the magalodon does n't come into view until halfway through the film and up until then you may find yourself wondering when they 're just going to get on with it - but once the shark does arrive , does get into frame - you begin to realize that there was something more building here . we 've seen the destruction of the environment used time and again in these kinds of films - it 's a backdrop . it 's something for the creator and builder of the worlds biggest and deepest oil rig to ravage and lay waste to - but here , the head of the colossus is actually a pretty good guy trying to provide the world with the fuel it needs . when they stumble upon the lair of the megalodon there is no talk of drilling for more oil - they all are taken by the wonder of finding a lost world . it almost seems as if the story might breakaway here and follow a different direction . but it never does - the shark swims in , knocks things about , knocks things over , breaks through things , and then gets blown to bits . we skip into a three months later , get our coda , then our stinger that there is not one ... but two , perhaps more megalodons now loose in the world 's oceans . nifty - but dull . there a ton of unanswered questions , and by the end you know the movie has cheated you ( can anyone explain why the earthquakes were needed in this film ? also , was the anchor cable drilled into the ocean floor ever going to break ? - they cut back to it at least three times after each quake and i kept waiting for it to snap and the colossus to tip over - never did ) . megalodon is what it is - full screen , ready for cable , jammed with a few nifty ideas and stuffed with off kilter cgi ( the subs looks fake - but look clean , while the megalodon itself looks and acts almost exactly like a plastic tub toy shark ) effects . not the best , not the worst - not jaws or any of the rest ... it 's megalodon , and it 's available for sale or to rent .
1	the movie `` days of heaven , '' written by terrence malic , is a movie of transcendentalism , anti-transcendentalism , and nature . in class , we have been discussing the term transcendentalism . also we have talked about how nature can not be destroyed or stopped . nature itself balances out life . from a meteor crashing to earth wiping out all life , to a simple hurricane wiping out a whole city and killing thousands , nature can not be inverted and prevented . in the movie `` days of heaven , '' this idea is clearly shown . the scene where the locusts were eating the crops is the prime example in this movie to me of how nature will always have its ways of evening things out . when life starts to get ahead , when things are going well for everyone , something always seems to happen . in this movie , everything was going well for everybody . this is when nature comes into play . locusts come to eat all crops . this is nature acting in response to the success of humans . what this says is that no matter how powerful humans are , the machines we have , or the ideas we come up with , nothing stands up to nature . in this movie , and in modern times today , people take advantage of life and what is available to us . in `` days of heaven , '' the characters lives are what some may call perfect . livestock is healthy , crops are good and productive , and just overall there are no problems . this is when people take advantage of what they have . we do not respect what we have and realize its importance . once it 's gone , that 's when we are aware of this . nature does its thing by balancing everything out . now it 's too late to appreciate what we had . as humans , we start over . with the work ethic and determination to have this life we once had , we will do whatever it takes . the continuous cycle of this is what makes life worth living . the thought of accomplishment , and that there will be problems in life is what drive us every day . one will face challenges all throughout their lives ; its how he or she reacts to these challenges that makes us who we are as humans
1	although he was raised by an underworld important personage. , james cagney will join f.b.i. , when a pal is killed by gangsters . , and he will put all his first hand experience to be useful . another little gem of william keighley of the middle thirties .
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all . it 's got an excellent story line , great characters and awesome animation . i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now , not just considering the cartoons either . it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers ( like me ) and adults alike . highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now . i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me
1	in 1969 an unknown soviet filmmaker mikhail kalatozov dared to tell an epic and tragic story concerned with the italian general nobile who tried to cross the north pole in a dirigible failing in his attempt . the awful odyssey in the middle of this ironically polar hell when no one responded his sos calls make of this film one of the darkest movies ever filmed . watch to sean connery as the artic explorer roald amudsen .
0	bernard hermman 's score is magnificent . this was a major let down for me considering it was directed by truffaut . lacked any real suspense and edge . boring camera work for the most part . some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster . the acting was fine ... i guess . it was just a pointless story i felt that really did n't go anywhere . and what was with that crummy ending
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?

0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	expected more from this movie - although deniro was good as usual
0	with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a `` blind date '' gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100 % for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' `` looking at america '' class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just `` played it safe '' . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****
1	this is an amazing service ! for only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment . in this case it was hg wells . great biography
0	i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they need n't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors , jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing
1	this episode embodies why i love this series . the bad guy is bad - and makes appearances throughout the series . and now , this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs . now you really do n't know what to think ... except that today is a day of honor . i wo n't blow it for you . watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample ... and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci-fi adventures .
1	let me be honest here ... i 'm not a big fan of either nicole kidman or tom cruise . however , this movie is wonderful . great story , great characters . the only reason i did n't give this movie five stars is the ending ; i think it could have been better . great movie overall
1	this is a great movie for airplane buffs and those who enjoy comedy . the filming and stunts are amazing . to think this was the beginning of aviation . a must see for anyone who appreciates comedy and/or aviation . a family favorite at my house , one we view over and over . the laughs never seem to stop
1	i think this is a great movie about a guilt stricken ira gunman . based on a book this movie will make you laugh , cry , and excited.this is a must
1	if you were a teenager in the mid-'90s ( and enjoyed it ) , you will probably love this movie and relate to it . it really captures the feel of the grunge era well . if , however , you 're one of those people who hates grunge music because it 's dark/depressing , you probably ca n't relate . since i was in high school from '94-'98 , i love girl . i happened upon it by accident ( someone recommended girl when he actually meant party girl ) , and i was so happy that i did . but i know the time period has a bad reputation . if you loathe nirvana , pearl jam , candlebox , my so-called life , and dyed hair , this movie probably is n't for you . all that said , i 'm making my assessment of the movie without having read the book , so if you want a book/movie comparison you 'll have to look at other reviews
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
0	i was very disappointed . the acting by the principles was fine , but i think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by bob fosse . i think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs . the following tunes from the original show were left out - near to you , we 've got to think about the game , a man does n't know . and applegate 's tune , the good old days , was abridged . a new tune , there 's something about an empty chair , was added to replace near to you , but it was very weak . i wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they 've done recently with music man and bye bye birdie
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg-1 which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still . love being able to download them all , just wish they 'd get updated quicker ! honestly , when i left 2 weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i 've missed the next 2
1	the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever . korean , american , does n't matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies . hollywood can not touch this one ! kim myoung min ( yi soon shin ) is outstanding in this ! ( no wonder he won the 2005 kbs best actor award for iyss ) it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional , funny , sad , and can make you angry ! ! the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal ! ! he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that ! my whole family , kids and all , watched this with me and loved it ! i can see why yi soon shin is korea 's hero and why other countries teach his methods
0	to put it succinctly , brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis , which is then swiped by joe pesci , the homeless dude who , predictably , is really quite wise . the problem is that his `` wise '' sayings are n't really too wise ; he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent , but does n't really know that much . joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying . that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character
0	i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd . i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies . however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed . it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes . the episodes : davy crockett , indian fighter ; davy crockett goes to congress ; and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier . the episodes davy crockett 's keelboat race ; davy crockett and the river pirates ; were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates . i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc . the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector 's box . the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $ 37- $ 100 whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for $ 14- $ 16 . i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately .
1	a very good wwii novel that in many ways is the literary bookend to the film 'das boot ' . both take place in small warships which is conducive to revealing personalities and dynamic group psychology . the reader sees the action primarily from the standpoint of keith lockhart , a former journalist who begins as a freshly minted volunteer reserve officer . his character resembles the author , nicholas monsarrat , who was rnvr himself , served in and eventually rose to command both a corvette and frigate during the war . nearly uncontrollable bureaucratic forces at play as the war drags on leads to a greater impersonality as humanity seemingly loses out to weapons and toughness as they move from the 90 person crew of the corvette to the 170 of the larger , more capable frigate .
0	the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine ' integrate back into society . yes , it 's been done before but still holds promise . the plot was adequate . the acting was believable - no complaints there . i particularly enjoyed sean pertwee as 'mace ' . and jason isaacs has long been a favorite actor . but what ruined the movie for me was the science . i 'm not a fanatic - i have no problems with ftl travel or spaceships 'banking ' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies . and i realize that movies are not 'real ' . but i 've never seen more 'bad ' science in any one movie . my son and i watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers . i could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night . it spoiled the whole movie for me
0	despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast ( including a top-notch soundtrack by u2 ) , the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations , with great performances lost in a bad script . it 's just a wanna-be art movie , and nothing else
1	this is the way comedy should be done- warm , funny , heart-touching , with a little craziness thrown in . hector elizondo and raquel welch are perfect- he 's understated , she 's over the top ... just like the movie . the story never bogs down , but zips right along nicely . the sisters bicker , their father worries , hortensia ( welch ) does her best to snag him , and we laugh . great fun ! a note on the rating for parents like me who wonder about the pg13 rating ( one can never tell these days ! ) : there 's one woman shown in skimpy underclothing , and one sex scene along with sexual references and jokes , so this would not be suitable for kids
1	this movie was excellent . i have a degree in public health so this was a smash hit to me . you can gain appreciation for it on many levels . i found the investigating of hiv and the disease course tracking to be interesting . anyone interested in politics or history would love this movie . anyone who has been touched by aids/hiv themselves or in knowing someone who suffered from the disease will gain knowledge and insight from this . anyone who is interested in government scandals or foreign relations would be drawn to the story . and mostly , anyone who can appreciate human interaction and flaws and how our sexuality is tied or not tied to our identity would glean a lot from this . the message and information is so powerful . of course as anything brought to tv there may be slight exaggerations to the story but for the most part it accurately chronicles the struggles both political and scientific that plagued the on-set on aids/hiv disease spread . the same frustrations can speak for many issues and so this is not only a piece dealing with the hard topic of aids but , since science doesnt often make it into hollywood , it is representative of many struggles . matthew modine and lily tomlin are wonderful
1	i checked out the movie from my local county library and really liked it . then i tried to purchase it from amazon and it was only available from canada . the cost of the shipping was as much as the movie so i cancelled the order
0	what a waste of fim ! too snide for my taste . maybe it 'd been entertaining back in the 60 's , but today it 's attempt at camp - or kitsch - is just too thin
0	... but , sadly , falls way short . they have a great storyline with a twisted triangle and intense power struggles but the filming is so choppy that one scene ends and the next begins , sometimes with no connection . the scenes do not blend into each other , forming a movie that is pleasant to watch . this movie jumps from one place to another that seems to contradict but with no explanation of the change . one scene the main girl is wildly in love with her husband , is forgiving of the king 's adulterous intentions and is supremely happy . shortly thereafter , she wants revenge on every person she 's ever met . yes , she was betrayed , in a way , but not by everyone . the only real high point of the movie is timothy dalton , who is a great actor , but this was a lousy setting for his talent . also , considering the plot of the movie , there were no intimate scenes . the only thing that happens in the bedroom is the king beats the girl and he nurses her back from smallpox . all in all , this story had great potential that was sadly wasted in this movie
0	just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children ; movies have ratings for a reason . this movie is rated pg-13 , which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children . in this case , it is crude humor . what i do n't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience , and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience should n't see it
0	an hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable , but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay , there is n't much else . granted , there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments , but it 's often dull
1	with a cable modem , took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download unbox , install the program and download the episode . it 's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb . i was able to still use my computer , ie 7.0 and realplayer , so the download is not a resource hog . the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles , which i found very convenient . the quality is great , but the video stutters in unbox . maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video ? i chose to watch the episode on windows media player 11 and i had no problems at all . i 've bought and watched 3 episodes , all with the same results . fast and unobstrusive download , great quality and low price . just use wmp , or another player that can handle wma files , to watch .
1	i purchased this a gift for a special friend as i know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape . when she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment . she has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience . i myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre . would only recommend for people who like broadway shows and musicals . i 'm glad i got this movie as a gift for her as i will now be remembered for many years to come
1	this is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading . our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions , climatic extremes , lack of water and nutrient-poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate . this type of recycling may become a necessity . hopefully , it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts . an eye-opener for sure
0	this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire . good snowboarding stunts , and the cast is great , sawa looks a little scruffy looking . like i said , with the snowboarding and action , dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon
0	this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great , including a phenomenal cast , lead by cate blanchett , and great scenery and cinematography . the actors playing elizabeth , cecil , and walsingham spoke and acted admirably , each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling , but the words themselves rendered the performances useless . the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material . they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins . it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain : had the author and director been more historically accurate , they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth , who is in turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love of her people , who had a private core described by her motto `` semper eadem '' , be always one . elizabeth ruled with her advisors , she was not totally ruled by them . she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table , nor would burleigh have allowed it . cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine , wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman ? the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all . we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective , and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne . one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna . i suggest that he should have first read some english history
0	this blatently derivative ( hat tip to ridley scott 's alien , with a hint of stanley donen 's saturn 3 thrown in ) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever . this makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is , presumably , employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills . throw in a ridiculously precocious ship 's computer and a downright silly robot , and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space . james spader and angela bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot , but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull . the `` happy ever after '' finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness . supernova 's only redeeming factor is that it is very short
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
1	great and fast to deal with will do buisness in the futur
1	whenever people hear of sofia coppola they think of 2 things : her much-maligned performance in godfather iii , and her famous dad francis ford coppola , director of the godfather films and apocalpyse now . the latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks , although it 's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately . `` jack '' anyone ? well this film and her next film lost in translation should tip the scale on her favor as she 's quite perfect for this kind of material . the 5 lisbon sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents , in particular their mother . after one of them commits suicide , a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest . an infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it 's over , they still do n't know how to make sense of it . one of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story , certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed . while i 'm certainly not faulting the film , we 're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are . in fact i could n't actually name them until someone in the film actually did . it 's not that big of a knock but it 's one thing i noticed . performance-wise it 's pretty solid across the board , including kirsten dunst and another against-type role for james woods . usually very manic , he 's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad . there 's also the almost unrecognizable kathleen turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with danny devito and giovanni ribisi as the narrator . the dvd definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of , deleted scenes and a commentary ? than again lost in translation seemed kinda sparse . a commentary on this disc from anyone would 've been great , even francis would 've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter 's first film . i mean this guy did do godfather , surely he could 've given a professional 's review of this ? it 's hard to say which film 's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance does n't make everything else terrible
0	movie got 2/3 through and just quit . no problem , this is windows right ? just reboot and start where you left off . only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning . i 'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again . only a couple bucks , but definitely not worth it
1	i absolutely love atlantis . from ronon dex , to sheppard , and to all the faces . i 'd cry if atlantis was cancelled . seriously though , steve should have never have died , he should also have been put in command of sg1 . can you imagine that ... '' why steve , welcome to earth ... you 're welcome to live out your life , if you only feed in self defense on enemies ... 'kay ? oh , you 're also in charge of sg1 . : p '' but seriously , the wraith make this show so awesome . from steve to bob to edward , to gordon and alexander , to michael and eric ( by far james 's best performance yet ) . the wraith make this show what it is . but one thing ? ? ? why do n't we have before i sleep ? seriously , you have no idea how irked i am at that , since i began watching in s.2.12 . anyways , i think atlantis totally pwns sg1
1	this is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book . the cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous . this film will delight both children and adults with it 's adventure , suspense , and innocent romance . it 's a little spooky in some scenes , but of the fun rather than truly scary kind . this story has a very positive underlying message but does n't preach , rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the secret garden and of themselves . no matter what age you are , this is a thoroughly enjoyable , uplifting , perhaps even transformative film - do n't miss it
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	i was surprised to see larry gelbart wrote the screenplay of this unfunny movie . i can recall very few laughs in this film . the premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the 1980 's , but the lesson is quite dated in the era of enron and worldcom . the greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront , in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late 1990 's . as for the message , i certainly do n't think the shareholders of rjr reynolds minded being courted so well . if i were a shareholder of a slumping company i 'd be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock ! james garner is wonderful in this show , and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand . i do have to confess , however , to dozing a bit in the middle of this movie , so perhaps i missed the funny parts
1	i urge everyone out there to download this episode ! this one totally rocks ! shep , a wraith and kolya all in one episode ! any episode with shep ( joe flannigan ) and kolya are well worth watching ! download this and download every other stargate sg1 and stargate atlantis episode !
0	i never received this product and will not order from you again . when there is a problem , you are not easy to reach
1	so far la strada is the only fellini movie i have ever seen and i really think it 's a superb movie ! magnificent ! anthony quinn and guilietta masina splendid as zampano and gelsomina . i highly recommend this dvd though i wish that criterion would lower the price of their dvds
0	waste of money . waste of time . well-known cast . amateurish direction . plotless . politically correct to the point of being stupid . the film 's incessant attempts at humor fail . eric roberts ' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film . he is self-important , godless and emotionally false . it 's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character . the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant . the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts ' passionate farewell kiss . most authentic moment in the film : lee grant 's reaction to her dying son being carried off . very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it 's so repetitive and vapid . you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments . if you choose to waste your time with this film , you 'll be sorry you did
0	i rented this , and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up . tech support couldnt help me , and instead just refunded my money . it was nothing but a waste of time
1	bones is one of my favorite tv series . this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track . great show even if you have never seen it from the begining
0	i did n't think i 'd miss the christopher reeve superman movies ( one and two at least ) and i really miss george reeves now ! ! ! ! those black and white superman shows were the best ! what 's her name was a horrible lois lane ! ! ! ! the whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row ! i do n't even care about the deleted scenes ! i want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - i 'm going to give this one away ! brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull ! ! i remember now that my brother told me i could wait for cable . i got greedy - someone bought him a dvd that was coded for another country ( there was russian writing on it ) and it would n't work in my dvd player so i got amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in brooklyn . i shoulda waited for cable
1	a great learning tool for childern of all ages
1	maria montez , jon hall and sabu made some very entertaining technicolor `` sand and sandals '' epics at universal and this dvd restoration showcases them in brilliant technicolor . it 's strictly saturday afternoon matinee stuff , nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots -- just the usual good vs. evil with hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role . exquisitely photographed on desert sands , it 's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting . turhan bey is effective in a brief role but it 's montez and hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace . well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the universal series starring this trio of stars

1	how can we ever be disappointed by a anthony hopkins performance ? in my opinion , one of the best actors of all time ( especially his portrayal of hannibal lecter ) . in this movie , he plays a anthropologist first living in africa among the rare and beautiful mountain gorillas . after defending the gorillas and killing 2 poachers in the process , he is captured and sent to a mental institution where a psychologist played by cuba gooding jr. ( who gives a good performance ) tries to delve in the mind of hopkins ' character and help him . i just love the flashbacks to africa and the gorillas . very touching scenes in this movie along with great acting . my favorite part of the movie is the ending where we see hopkins return to the gorillas and the place he feels he truly belongs and truly wants to be . great movie !
0	this movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high . most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure . there is alittle action at the end , but of poor qualaty . to make a long review short , it is basically like a bad episode of g.i jeo
1	being a fan of russ meyer movies since classics like `` mudhoney '' , `` vixen '' and `` lorna '' it is amazing what happens , when russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company . likewise italian competitor tinto brass russ gets in feel with picturing `` erotic '' in a slight different way . i liked this movie very much for it 's blooming 60 's pop-feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women . i 'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on dvd with a great transfer and lots of extras . well done . ( hope my english is half the way understandable , sorry i 'm german )

1	this is a traditional telling of the life of jesus , from before his birth to the resurrection . the cinematography is breathtaking , the color , the costuming , the writing aided by carl sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of jesus weeping and then raising lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring . it was this scene which motivated me to write this review . rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb , stevens has jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff , puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill . once there , jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of ivan mestrovic and the french bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches the high tomb , stevens and sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the god of life before jesus calls out , `` lazarus ! come forth ! '' but in striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back the camera , hundreds of feet from the tomb showing jesus , the son of the almighty , as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside , let alone the universe , much as the fist fight between charlton heston and gregory peck in big country , shows the scale of man to god 's work . however , as jesus calls-out lazarus instead of seeing him rise , we see the wonderment , the bewilderment , the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss . we see in the crowd , as the camera dollies , rolls and scans , the faces of the believers , the unbelievers , the doubters and the ever faithful , their reactions to a man dead three days , reawakened by an act of god , brought forth by a human being , favored by god . how much more effective was this direction ? rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing , the awe , the tears of joy , the fear , the love , the attempts to reconcile with reality , the unbelievable . there was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair is too short . if you believe , clap your hands , and even if you do n't , its worth the 199 minutes of your time . i saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the vhs and dvd , and watched it with a group , one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the lazarus scene . 4.75 star
0	as a frequent visitor to the himalayas and being closely in touch with both tibetans ( ordinary folks , not the tortured ones ) and the chinese , i find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided . i have not met a single wealthy tibetan in nepal or india , who can swear to me that he will return to a freed tibet , run by their government in exile . to be fair to the `` experts '' , a lot of the evidence of chinese violence against the tibetans is real . i sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated . however , the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of chinese aggression . while it is true that many tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time , it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries . were there no looters , vandals , infighting ? if you had ever witnessed these riots , would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire ? it 's also incredibly naive to assume that all tibetans think the same . even dharamsala , the seat of the tibetan government in exile is not without opposition , violence and even assasination . while i do think that most tibetans are good buddhists and nice people , the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the chinese and everything saintly with the tibetans . this is something i find totally unacceptable . a few snapshots of tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing . the documentary seems only able to find tibetans who are against chinese rule . they paint the picture that nobody in tibet is happy . this is patently untrue . but then , this sort of thing sells in america . you have to have a demon , you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero ( america in this case ) . otherwise , it just wo n't sell . it 's not about compassion at all . if you really want to be `` illuminated '' , visit tibet and tibetan communities all over china and see things for yourself . that would be far more enlightening . sadly , many journalists prefer to interview the wrong ( right ? ) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent
0	maybe it was just me , but this concert dvd is a major disappointment ! it 's quite surprising to see how little ( if any ) connection madonna makes with the audience . shorn of her locks , her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here . perhaps it 's a result of her having become larger than life ( ala striesand , whitney houston , etc. ) . despite all the razzle-dazzle here , examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound . songs like `` vogue '' and `` express yourself '' should have been rousing stompers . instead , they are overstylized , choreographed to the max and perfunctory ( the effect is like watching a canned tv award show performance ) . worst of all is her ill-conceived `` like a virgin . '' i can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom , but `` virgin '' recast as 1940 's marlene dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch ( complete with unisex tuxedo , top hat and faux-german accent ) ? ? ? ? this is a shocking lapse in judgment -- and boring to boot ! ! ! the only sign of life comes near the end , with the lock-step performance of `` holiday , '' which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp . here , she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats ! one look at this performance and you ca n't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff . no one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow , but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for . i 'm willing to give madonna one more shot and pick up the blond ambition dvd when or if it becomes available . until then , my best advice is to check out dvds featuring the likes of tina turner , donna summer or even sade -- they all prove that you can make the old new again , share and reveal something that a studio production ca n't , and thus never need to worry about going stale . real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp -- it 's audience connection !
1	this is one of the great `` unknowns '' in the movie world : a great film seen by very few people . i 'm still waiting for the dvd but not holding my breath . thankfully , my vhs is still good . but like anything good , we 'd like to share this with others and most people have never heard of this movie . for those sensitive souls who enjoy a fascinating portrait of an unusual person or persons that is both sad and uplifting , this is your ticket . it has both , in spades ... ..a haunting film you ca n't forget . it 's a tragic tale yet has a happy ending of sorts and leaves you feeling satisfied . what it is , and i ca n't remember if it is based on real-life situation , is the story of a woman who has a dwarf for a son and what happens to the two of them , beginning in france , moving to ireland , over to the united states and then back to ireland . along the way , the mother , played so sadly by french actress anne parillaud ( the original la femme nikita ) , gets involved with two men : gabriel byrne and matt dillon . all three of these adults are really interesting , likable people , but nothing like the dwarf , who is played magnificently by two actors . alan pentony plays `` frankie '' has a child and a more lovable kid would be hard to find . corbin walker does a great job of playing the adult `` frankie . '' trust me : you will not forget either of them . walker narrates the film , telling it mostly in flashback style , from his best-selling book . in addition to his mom and the two father-figures in his life , is a short story of frankie 's love affair with astronomy and the stars , hence `` frankie starlight . '' the only profane character in the movie is the book publisher who has two short scenes . that , and two quick sex scenes , give it the `` r '' rating . otherwise , this is wonderful old-fashioned storytelling , the kind that makes you really care about the characters .
0	this movie i think was just plain depressing ! just when you think something good and happy will happen , someone dies , people seperate , bones are broken , so on and so forth . this movie got alot of great reviews , and it was a fun movie , but for people who like complete happy endings , this film is not for you .
0	this movie was ok . i do prefer the messenger starring milla jovovich . milla is exceptional in that version
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
0	after a promising start , stan laurel and oliver hardy 's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of mgm mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king . however , chef ollie 's `` steak a la oliver '' is worth a few laughs
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
1	no matter how many years pass ; still one of the best kung fu flicks ever made
1	lisa rinna and gail o'grady become best friends..not realizing that they share the same man ! both women perform very well in this movie ... i have been a big fan of both of them since melrose place and nypd blue . sally kirkland also does a great job in this movie as gail o'grady 's mother . this movie is filled with so many different ingredients : intrigue , lessons on overcoming fears , and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy . i 've seen it a few times , and enjoy it more each time
0	i thought this movie looked cool from the preview , but it was a bit of a bore . i had a vague idea of what the director was going for , but it just was n't there . film noir meets john hughes . the female lead is intoxicating , however . not worth the four bucks
0	do not waste your time or money , see the original . once in awhile , a remake of a movie from another culture works ; for example , seven samurai becomes `` magnificant seven '' -- most of the time , the remake is trash . the original `` la femme nikita '' is a great movie : exciting with a strong political viewpoint ; this version is simply hollywood pablum
0	i ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive
0	i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard ( of sports night fame ) was scowling hard , trying to be a tough detroit cop . not believable for a nanosecond . and then it got worse when marky mark said , `` why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee ? '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clich�d rhythm . almost every scene in this thing is a howler . and watching it , i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious . still , tyrese is better than garrett hedlund , who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders . but the movie 's not a total wash ; after all , it 's got a great soundtrack
1	although this is n't the most polished movie , it is genuinely entertaining , and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars . i ca n't remember why i first picked it up ( i did n't see it in the theaters ) , but it is a consistently funny , touching film . i 'm not a fan of sarah jessica parker , elle macpherson ( who i feel turns in the strangest , poorest performance of the bunch ) , or even ben stiller , but i think it 's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love , but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship . all in all , it 's a bunch of laughs , and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat
1	i originally saw this as a lad growing up in 1966 when i went with family to the theater . it was very funny than and it is just as refreshing today . this is the story about a russian sub-captain who decides to breach the 25 mile coastal barrier of the united states at a time when we were deeply in the cold war and the russians were all citizens of the glorious soviet union or so they called it often . they were at the time , enemies bent on the destruction of the united states of america , in place of their brand of communism ( something that works on paper , but not in practice ) . anyhow they get so close to the united states shores of a new england island community that their submarine became stuck on a sand bar . that was the first act of war against the united states . the captain than sends a group of crew members ( lead by russian speaking alan arkin ) ashore . they are in uniform , that is the second act of war on the united states . but they are not only in uniform . they have machine guns , a third act of war against the united states of america . they soon find a family with a father who is a nervous wreck , carl reiner , in his own respect a longtime great actor ( the real life father of meathead-rob reiner ) and a boy who spots the russians and wants to do the right thing and shoot them . so throughout the movie , the kid when we see him is being held back , but in a funny sort of way . the family is soon overcome and the group takes their car , lead by a hilarious and persistent alan arkin , but they leave a blonde ( machine gun toting ) guy behind to guard the family . in a distraction and struggle the father ( of meathead ) gains the upper hand and chases blondie off , or so they figure . with the car gone , he soon takes a bicycle towards town while the family waits . the sheriff of the town played by brian keith a great actor we all miss dearly these days , and the deputy , played by an always funny jonathon winters fall into their own chaos amongst panicked ( understandably ) townsfolk . the idea of the group of russian 's going into town is to steal a large motor boat to tow the sub off the sand bar . will they succeed in all the madness that pursues , amongst other subplots like a love story ? i can tell you this has a great ending , and its well worth watching . its almost a timeless movie you can watch over and over again
0	the ones that are posted twice do not work . if they are posted once , you can try to download it , but it might not work . the video only worked for about a minute . shame , since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool . the one cent csi works , go download tha
0	the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst , josh hartnett , kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline . this film is directed by sofia coppola ( lost in translation ) , i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself , you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time . sometimes magic does not stirke twice . how can all five sisters end up killing themselves , their homelife was n't that unbearable , a lot of parents are religious , but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide . kristen dunst just gets on my nerves , her acting is the same in every film . do n't believe the hype , the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking , poetic film
0	unable to see the movie . received the original shipment , and later a replacement , and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
0	an average movie with average performances . glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters . it wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book .
0	this is n't funny . it is n't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could have been great , if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director , but it did n't , so it turned out mediocre at best . unfortunately , i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch . i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read , this was going to be a brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now that we 've watched it , he and i both know better . we know it 's dreadful , and i can only imagine all the nice things i 'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity . the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before . i 'm pleased to say i won the argument . that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me . in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic ' as others so often describe it . i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie , or to find it even a little bit funny , but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards . if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up a copy of flash gordon . that has great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , and a soundtrack by queen . furthermore , it has stood the test of time and is still great today , unlike 'the ice pirates ' , which has dated really badly . better yet , get hold of some 'red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good , it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies
1	i find most `` stoner '' movies to be too juvenile to bother with . this is not a typical stoner movie , though , because the leads are not slacker losers , they 're intelligent guys ( one 's an investment banker , the other an aspiring med student ) who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope . which , truth be told , is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today . the best bits are hilarious . watch out for the british twin sisters , the evangelical tow truck driver , and neil patrick harris ( doogie howser ) as a sex crazed drug addled party animal . the only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah . pointless and not funny . that said , this is not highbrow humor . but if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre . what really elevates this movie is the harold and kumar characters . silly antics aside , these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry . i do n't know why i have n't seen john cho and kal penn in more movies , but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel
0	i think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was , they 're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right . think about this for a moment : what was the motive ? that was something i never figured out . the killer did n't have a motive . that 's what threw me off . but i guess some would say a crazed killer does n't need a motive . but come on ! even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing . even norman bates had a reason for killing . it could be the reason was explained but i just missed it because the movie was so terrible . i do n't know . i really do n't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out . i know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles , one of them is the killer for sure ; but you 're thrown off by the fact that you have andy garcia , d.w. moffett , and sam l. jackson . so all 3 are fair game
1	worth the money but dont think it is a feel good happy movie its about life
0	there is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book . we used this book in for our men 's study group and every one of the men , and every one of the wives agreed , that this was a worthless book . it was written for a 1950 's wife that no longer exists . now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are : discovering the mind of a woman by ken nair if only he knew by gary smalley together forever : how to overcome problems and rekindle the love in your marriage by anne kristin carroll they are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband
1	it was pretty damn funny ! this movie was recommended by my good friend , bobby asslong . in most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [ ... ] , but he hit it right on , with this one ! i detest tom green . he is one of those guys , who that when he fails at something ( talk show , most of his movies , life ) i actually feel happy . and this is actually contrary to my normal personality . i normally automatically love all canadians . just kidding . i normally want people to succeed , and feel bad when they fail . but tom green is so annoying . great news ! he is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie , so you should be able to get through this movie , with little to none hatred for mr. green . i love all the characters in this movie , especially the main protagonist , who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college . he is very likeable , and you 're pulling for him the whole time . another thing i like this movie , is that it pulls a lot from other `` gross out '' teen and college flicks , but it does n't go overboard in the gross out department . tom green plays the voice over explainer in the movie , and he actually does a pretty good job , without appearing stupid . i give this high reviews ! mc white said : check it out ! !
1	as a fan of new order and joy division this was on the top of my list . fast-paced , witty , and shot in documentary like style , 24 hour party people is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like go , all gone pete tong , groove , etc . winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and steve coogan is terrific . the soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high . not to be missed by fans ( not ultimate fans ) and general movie goers alike
0	i know , goldy got another movie later , but here we see why he is n't the next 'rock ' . supoorting cast is pretty bad and belgian kickboxing champ van dam just is n't schwarzenegger ( that says a lot ! ) and movie night filming does n't help ! props and fake us army set up looks like something out of a return of the living dead set ! not really any- thing to right home about unless you 're into bill goldberg , `` next stop , intensive care ... '' , just like van dam and b.g . 's careers after this movie . can you beleive van dam did ( another ) sequel ? !
0	will not play once video was downloaded . i get the error message : `` can not play file , please try again later . error # 0x80040273 '' i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed , i was told the unbox saturday and sunday 6-5 hours . i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature . i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem . thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again - feb. 10,200
1	dr smith and the robot go hog wild , switching personalities and swapping insults . this is a great episode
1	flawless and beautifully rieveting `` the joy luck club '' has to be the best movie i have ever seen , and probably will be the only one of it 's kind . the story is beautiful and timeless and i encourage everyone to see it . it makes you think of the relationships of your family and how , even though this is a movie , it can impact you beyond belief . it will rock you to the core of your being and i am living proof
0	i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it . i was not shocked with the horrible acting , but was surprised with the hot stars . this movie had both hot guys and girls . the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht `` freddy '' , he is so hot . we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body . he did a great job in his breif scene . josh edwards `` trian '' was okay to look at too . as for the actress ... venesa taylor is also hot
1	doctor who materialised without his tardis on this , my first timelord download in the amazon unbox , which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside . for a very reasonable sum , $ 1.99 , my family and i were able to enjoy the first third doctor adventure after his regeneration , where he encounters the nestene conciousness . the down load took only a few minutes although i had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program . thanks to the good people at amazon tech support i was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental . a great experience and will not be the last . easy to navigate and fun for all the family . someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis '
1	were scenes added to the dvd . if yes , what scenes ? for example , did dave ever talk to katarina after she slapped him , in the original release
0	the ideas behind 15 minutes are n't bad at all . take one robert deniro , put him in new york , mix him with some american-dream hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree , and try to provoke some emotions , and have a sly dig at the american justice system . lets see ... nothing happened ... only repulse . if , like everyone else , you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it , you will be dissapointed . he puts in a tired performance , almost as if he knows the film is a load of b.s . the attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong , instead it 's just repulsive over the top violence , and its pointless ... naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces , why ? there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning , such as 8mm ( the horrible subject of snuff movies , hard-hitting meaningfull film ) , 15 minutes is far from meaningfull . we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that , but when converting it to a film , it needs a deeper meaning , otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood [ ... ] . if you like brain-dead gore and violence , lack of plot and cringing melodrama . go ahead
0	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon.com never sent it too me . this has happened about 4/5 times . while usually i have no problem getting movies , sometimes i do . sending them e-mails does n't seem to work . if they did n't have the best prices for movies , i 'd leave
1	i was looking for solyent green since i was young after seeing it in theater as a science-fiction drama . now that i found it , i do not know if i am very happy to see it again considering that it might be closer to reality than to sci-f
0	if you 've seen one you 've seen them all . uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl , she brings him out of his shell . well , i bought this for like two dollars , and maybe it was worth it . i watch it like once a year . no special features on dvd worth mentioning . ben affleck is getting married , he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding . but things keep getting in his way . forces of nature . also , he keeps running into , and ca n't seem to get away from , some weird chick ( bullock ) . are these signs ? should he stop being so uptight , and go with this free-spirited chick ? or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle ? the acting in this movie is `` meh '' , meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie ; and affleck sucks , as usual . the other small parts are well done , for the most part . the script is formulaic , and the cinematography at times is interesting . it 's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell . the movie opens with a stripper scene , no nudity . there is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie . there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar . just thought i 'd throw that in , in case you 're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something , and that kind of thing bothers you . you only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic , or a big fan of either affleck or bullock . otherwise this is completely forgettable .

0	i ca n't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie . frankly , i thought it was a dog . not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing , if improbable . and the girl herself was a real sweetie , and a good actress - perfect for the part . in fact , the acting all around was admirable . but the script ! yikes ! not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did . people acting awkward or mean ( in fact , just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean ) , or spiteful , or stupid , for no reason at all ! it seems as though somehow , the movie could have been good , but did n't make it . call it almost watchable . i came away from lawn dogs ( yawn dogs ? ) feeling not at all enriched . puzzled , perhaps , at why anyone would make such a movie . well , there was that admirable , unlikely friendship . but that was all . pass this one by
1	this episode of star trek , `` the man trap '' is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise . truthfully , `` the man trap '' terrified me ( i was maybe two , or three , although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it 's third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time ) ; star trek was considered `` adult programming '' , and as such i was not allowed to watch it - i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house , then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i 'd seen , but excited just the same . like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by ( lost in space ) , i did n't recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in , but remained frightened of anyhow ( i was , as i said , very young ) .
0	i was very unimpressed with this movie . `` borat '' suffers from the same delusion as sarah silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect automatically equals funny . it does not . of course sometimes it can be hilarious ( and borat does have moments like that ) , but overall i did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing . especially the scene where the naked friend sits on borat 's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on . at some point i just fast forwarded it . you 're not missing much if you do n't watch this movie
1	one of the `` must see '' christmas movies . a family oriented movie that will rekindle the christmas spirit in everyone . we have this on vcr tape and have watched it so much that we purchased the dvd version . enjoy
0	sat down and saw this one on televion . only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money . what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement . slanders the u-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders . other than allied propoganda pieces , there are no incidents of u-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats . the movie itself i have little respect . basicly plotless and unrealistic . action scenes unbelievable . characters two dimensional . this film awful .
0	after seeing some of the other amazon reviews of this movie , and the fact that jason swartzman was in it ( after having seen him for the first time in `` rushmore '' - a wonderful film ) , i had to purchase a copy of this dvd for myself to view . it 's got a wonderful cast of fine actors , but i found this movie really dumb . one critic on the dvd box claimed this was `` laugh out loud funny . '' really ? what movie was he watching ? i strained a chuckle here and there , but that was about it for me . the lily tomlin dustin hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script . i know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie , but i did n't find much to snicker about .
1	in 1962 elvis was given a script that would take full advantage of his flare for comedy and `` fierce '' timing , ... the movie was `` follow that dream , '' ... and he would never see this oppurtunity again for the rest of his career.elvis deliver 's a flawless `` deadpan '' comedic performance that is seamless from start to finish that will remind you of a young andy griffith.through the innocent eyes of toby kwimper , ..we see a different world , ..a world not so harsh and positive to the touch.in the courtroom scene that would be the climatic event of the film elvis deliver 's one of the finest speeches i have ever seen on film , ... and there is not a dry eye in the house.we see through this performance that elvis the actor needed only a suitable script and then he would keep up his end of the bargain . `` follow that dream '' is a wonderful motion picture that has an endearing cast of great actors who were among the best of their time , ... and it shows.this was elvis 's crowning glory , ..if that he had one.a finer performance by elvis you will not find on film , ..watch him shine
1	justice in the criminal justice system ? what is that but empty talk in the real world ? in hell shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife 's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system . no macho van damme kickboxing here , but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate . a true portrayal of life in today 's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men , and corrupt power brokers who run them .
0	this has to be stephen king 's worst work adapted . this adaptation is even worse than needful things . children of the corn ( i am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels ) was miles abouve better than this garbage . just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book . just plain trash
1	not since `` duel in the sun '' has there been so much passion and lust on the screen . the king is so totally obsessed with one of his subject 's wives that he loses everything to possess her.the king nurses his beloved back to health when she developes smallpox . the king 's tenderness and loving care in these scenes are absolutely precious . when the king is dying the object of his obsession realizes that she loves him . however , it is too late for both of them . the movie is so erotic yet there is not any graphic depiction of sex . the sets and costumes are absolutely gorgeous . golina is so voluptuous not one of these 90 pound anorexics with one of the roundest and best derrieres in film timothy dalton is absolutely great in this movie and should have received an academy award for his compelling portrait of how love can drive one senseless and mad . he continues to be one of the greatest actors but his work continues to be unappreciated by critics and audiences except the few intelligent movie fans than recognize his greatness . additionally , hollywood producers can not see that he has soul and what a fantastic actor he is . dalton gives his all in every part . he receives roles in films that do not give him an opportunity to ultilize his amazing range of acting skills . dalton is always convincing in every role that he plays . the audience always gets their money worth when he is on the screen . dalton continues to be so charismatic , however , his parts are consistently supporting roles , unchallenging and/or too small . it is tragic that dalton 's magneticism and presence has gotten larger while hollywood films having gotten smaller . unfortunately , hollywood films of today are `` techno gimic '' flicks or silly comedies that appeal to the theater going public that have minds of ten-year-olds
0	`` sleep with me '' would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of `` top gun . '' that lasts about two minutes . the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious , ersatz neo-bohemian characters . except for tarantino 's `` top gun '' bit ( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off ) there 's nothing worthwhile here
1	make no mistake ; `` chato 's land '' is a sprawling , unforgiving environment that offers little water and no reward . the blistering , sprawling landscape of rock and sagebrush , however , is but a backdrop in this story that shows man at his most ugly of moments . charles bronson stars as pardon chato , a half apache indian who is enjoying a drink in a saloon when he is antagonized by an arrogant sheriff . chato goes against the sheriff 's wishes to leave because of his heritage , and lets his actions speak for themselves , leaving the mouthy lawman dead on the floorboards . a posse is soon rounded up with a variety of area men , many of them farmers and ranchers . they embark on a trip to find chato and avenge the death in town , as well as feed some of their own continual hatred towards the indians in general . greed , hate and perseverance battle logic , pride and tolerance as the group soon start battling each other over what they think is right and wrong when it comes to avenging the death of the lawman . a great western film from 1971 , chato 's land offers a solid and stoic storyline that is wrought with irony as well as themes of loyalty and revenge . charles bronson aside , a superb supporting cast is experienced as well . victor french ( later of `` little house '' and `` highway to heaven '' stardom ) graces the screen as one of the posse members , and with jack palance and james whitmore in tow , its a well rounded cast that never lacks quality in acting despite a somewhat linear storyline . palance plays the part of quincy whitmore , a war veteran who understands , and sometimes even respects the apache 's actions more than most . his arch-nemesis is jubal hooker ( played by simon oakland ) who has the `` fever '' of wanting to see the apache man hang , even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down to the last man . jubal is excellently played by oakland as a man who is consumed with his own destiny of vengeance . loyalties loved and lost , a large part of the movie is very emotional in power and prestige as we experience the dismay of the men as they deal with the battles that rage within their very own camp , and minds . with bronson portraying a cunning , intelligent and yes even ruthless apache warrior , chato 's land is a western that is filled with buzzards drinking blood , the dark side of man , and the notion that if you go to battle with someone in their own back yard , you better think twice about who has the best odds , regardless of how many men you bring with you . the scenic landscape and the shots taken at night as well as during the scorching hot days are excellent , and the sound quality of this dvd in my opinion is very good if not perfect . if you want a western that gets dirty but portrays a deep story within , see `` chato 's land ''
1	this movie would probably not be on anyone 's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980 's b flick movie loving enthusiast ! the stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80 's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious ! i remember renting this movie ( on beta ) in my childhood over and over again , much to my parents chagrin . the stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is .
0	i watched this movie , seeing that it was a `` shark '' movie . but where 's the shark ? ? the plot is these people are hostages . the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie . but i was watching going , `` okay , they 're in the water , where is the shark ? ? ? '' even jaws 3 , ( which sucked ) has more sharks . if you like hoatage movies , see this . ( on second thought , do n't ... ) but if you like sharks , see something else
0	yeah , ok , ice cube is a bounty hunter and mike epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys , am i right on that ... right . the story is great but not that great . so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky , thats what it was like for me folks . god i almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax . put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this . for cube and epps and eva mendes fans only . and if you wan na see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it , then this is the film for you
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes . yes , it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment , but not enough to watch this film . it could be a cure for insomnia , though . fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed . you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen , and it 's really just very boring . all those fans of johnny depp : be particularly warned . he may have co-star billing , but blink and you 'll miss him
1	for those of you with endless episodes of blue 's clues on your dvr or tivo , this movie is the perfect addition to your collection ... not to mention , it 's nice to have something different to play . my nearly 2 year old hated this movie at first - she did n't like steve - but now she will only watch steve and absolutely adores this movie . it 's got everything that the 22 minute tv show has ... just in an extended version . we are constantly signing the songs from the movie , which started actually out of the blue ( no pun ) by my daughter . i did n't even realize she knew them so well without the movie playing ... but at dinner one night she just started signing `` hey hey - shobadee ay - beep bop bay - hey hey '' . anyway , it 's a must have ! ! ! [ ..
0	for a 2-disc , director 's cut , my expectations were perhaps too high for this dvd . nevertheless , i was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer . the colors were dull throughout , and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes . for the movie itself , i do n't agree that it is holding up well over time . at 25 years old , the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who are n't waiting for their beloved canceled tv series to be on the big screen . there 's no question that ii and iv are the best of the series , but comparing it to other star trek original cast movies is n't putting the bar very high . my interest in watching this again was just having finished melville 's moby dick , the final scenes of which khan repeats liberally during the final space battle . that said , i think montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed khan and very evocative of ahab . however , shatner 's pretentious kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on . the original cast schtick just does n't make for a compelling drama
0	i love this movie as i have seen it many times . audie murphy did a great job in playing himself , although it must have been really hard to relive . a movie that i would highly recommend .
1	`` the mother '' is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is n't ready to stay home , watch `` the telly , '' and vegetates after her husband of nearly three decades , and a controlling , dominating chap at that , packs it in with a massive heart attack . may ( anne reid ) is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect , indeed demand , a future of happiness . but she is also inescapably vulnerable . she 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters . who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand , much less resolve . in her sixties , she 's still a work in progress . `` something 's got ta give '' showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . after all it 's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . and to insure that no serious psycho-social issues were explored , keaton 's young girlfriend , amanda peet , daughter of keaton , not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old ( er ) would-be lover never hopped into the sack . not on this film . people probably gasped when may writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover , darren ( daniel craig ) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may when this first came out on theaters . i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings ' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex . it 's to be inspected that anne reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . i truly ejoyed this film last night and will never forget it . kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy .
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
1	terrific movie . matthew broderick makes you believe that he is a high school social studies teacher with every step he takes and every rhythm of his speech ( `` good luck , there , tracy '' ) . reese witherspoon ca n't be accused of underacting her part , but that 's the fun of it . she is hilarious as the high school overachiever who does n't care who she steps over ( or on ) to succeed . filmed on the site of a real omaha high school , many of the other members of the cast are taken from local talent . all the extras are actual students , and one of the leads ( chris klein of `` american pie '' who plays tracy 's archrival paul ) was just the kid who had nailed the part of tony in the school 's recent production of `` west side story . '' this was his break-out movie . even the custodian was played by the real custodian . all that gives the film a kind of realism that 's rare . it accordingly uses ordinary sounds and spaces brilliantly , from the rotating sprinkler that begins the film , to the noises of kids talking outside class , to the grind of the garbage truck in the early morning hours when mr. m snoozes outside linda novotny 's house waiting for her ( never ) to return home . and on the subject of garbage , watch for the number of times this becomes a motif in the film , leading up to the culminating event ( which i wo n't spoil ) . even the denouement has a rehabilitated mr. m , turned museum docent , throwing trash at the rear window of a limo . this is not only a very funny movie ; it 's also an intelligent and careful one . a lot of sex too , but none of it glamorous
0	whenever i 'm asked what is the worst movie i have ever seen , i quickly respond , `` cabin boy . '' it is like a long , meandering , and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker . i would describe the plot , but there is none . i watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline , but it never came . it was written by a former staff writer for david letterman , which is the only conceivable reason that letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity . even he later joked about how awful the movie was . chris elliott plays the only character he has ever played -- the annoyimg dumb guy loser . his limited acting talent , combined with a nonsensical plot , unfunny dialogue , and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor , truly make cabin boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss
1	ive seen them live in norwich ( england ) and they were wonderful , its a little slow to start but with wonderful light humour and sound that have to be heard live to belive , a wonderful performance from 6 men who are all in their own way geourgus and extreamly talented , you will leave tired for them , i brought the dvd but it doesnt give you the real thing , if their in a town near you , go , their worth every penny to see , im not a dance person but oh how i wish now i was ! ! ! ! ! wonderful , breathtaking and loud..
1	this was the best series on television in the late 1980 's . my sister and i never missed an episode . yet it still is n't on dvd . i can buy `` i love lucy '' and `` dawson 's creek , '' but i ca n't have all three seasons of my beloved vincent and his velvet-over-gravel voice . what the heck gives ? please put this out on dvd ! !
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in 96 ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .
1	i was n't expecting much when i dropped this 1998 movie into the dvd player ... there is a lot to commend itself . matt damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam ! danny devito is slimy , shady , sarcastic , and sleazy ( in other words , perfect devito ) as damon 's partner . the main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia . the sleazy big insurance company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter . they bet wrong ! our hero , guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge ( dixon from alias ) , come to the rescue . the pieces fit together quite nicely . justice is served , bad guys are taken down , and matt damon establishes himself as an unlikely , unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process . nothing wrong with this story or this film . very delightful and satisfying in every respect .
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
1	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in , his performance is pretty damn good . the supporting cast are mostly excellent , with diana rigg a standout as a venal , vicious , voracious , yet strangely feline and alluring regan , and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril . leo mckern is the definitive gloucester
1	in the late 80 's to early 90 's , mickey rourke may as well have been a porn star . hell , every movie rourke was in he was playing the same character who got a different hot chick ... they were big-screen soft core porn films . problem is , mickey rourke is so good at playing these characters that the movies he 's done are n't that bad . here , rourke plays wheeler ... who wo n't really enter into the synopsis for a moment . rourke 's ex-wife carre otis plays emily , a young international lawyer who recieves a job with a big firm in new york and is hastily sent to rio de janeiro . in rio , with her boss claudia ( jaqueline bisset ) away ; emily begins to come into contact with sex almost everywhere she goes . then , she meets wheeler . wheeler is that odd , soft-spoken , rich , womanizer guy every guy wishes they could be . wheeler is the guy who says stuff to women in movies that we would never be able to get away with , but onscreen it just looks so damned easy . anyway , unlike `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , wheeler and emily do n't just begin having sex . in fact , the big sex payoff is n't until the final minutes of the movie . and let 's face it , if you rent this movie ... you 're not renting it for the story . truth is , the story 's not even that intriguing or event good for that matter . the whole movie has a plot like a soft-core porn movie . thing is , otis and rourke have enough charisma on screen to pull of a movie like this . so , even if you ignore the sex , the movie is n't that bad . i , personally , think it 's better than 9 1/2 weeks . fact is , even if you do n't give a damn about the story . carre otis is f**king hot , so check it out . grade : b+
1	there are tons of women in prison films out there . there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive . however , this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action . pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison . the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women , who were full of one-liners and crazy notions . but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film ... .lots of nudity ... violence ... bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity . it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house
0	michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion . he has done such great b-movies as this , q , and it 's alive 3 : island of the alive . how awesome is he ? ? anyways , i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously , thinking that it is going to be your typical movie . but you should n't because not only is this a b-movie , but it is supposed to be funny . my favorite part is when `` the stuff '' started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it . who would do that ? ? i just started laughing by butt off when that happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth , do n't be too critical on it . what i learned from the stuff : dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth ! if you like the stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such as island of the alive 3 , zombi 3 and 4 , etc
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion . this is the first of two downloads that did n't play . i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok
1	kickboxer 2 the road back deals with david sloan . the brother of kurt & amp ; eric sloan david is running his brothers kickboxer school tung po killed off van damme 's charcter for the first kickboxer i say good sasha mitchell is a lot better tung po can only regain his honor by fighting david since kurt is dead so david vs. tung po with glue and glass is a bloody battle great movie the best in the series
1	this movie has all the best comedians in it ! remember norm macdonalds character from saturday night live news ... `` note to self.. '' and his tape recorder ? this movie is his saturday night live parable . chris farley , adam sandler ( guest appearnce ) even little gary coleman . its hiliarious and quotable
1	i saw this documentary in a theater when it was first released in the 1970 's . 30 years later , many of the images remained etched in my mind . i was shocked to see the living conditions of the miners and their families . i was moved by their stories of struggle and perseverance . we often forget that coal miners risk their lives every day so that we can stay warm and have light in our homes . regardless of how you feel about unions , this movie will make an impression on you . highly recommended
0	i am a huge fan of bbc period drama and have nearly exhausted my library 's supply of miniseries based on the works of austen , gaskell , dickens , and eliot . but i would have to say that the bbc struck out this time . the direction was bad , the acting was mediocre at best , the music was obtrustive , and the screenplay was just plain awful . after the first half-hour my sisters and i survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another . i have not read the book so i do n't know how much of it is from the source material . makes me curious to read it , though . the costumes and some of the scenery were good ; i 'll give it that
1	i reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting-both are unbelievebly good-but because of what the studio had done to the movie . it was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght . when exhibitors demanded that it be shortened warner 's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes . in the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had , and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie . because of initial sloppiness ( footage being thrown out ) , it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film . the result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes . gone , too , apparently . is vicki lester 's screen test . all of this aside , what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored dvd is superb . the color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent . the actors ' performances are outstanding . not only is garland a superb singer and dancer , but the close intimate scenes with mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film . mason , too , is superb as norman maine . when drunk , his character is absolutely dispicable-becoming phisical and violent . great , too , is the supporting cast.jack carson as the studio publicist libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart lionel streater did in 1937 . this is , by far , the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing- dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction.there is not one corny word of dialog in the moss hart script
0	i found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives . i was constantly wondering where i would draw the line if i was the heroine . the experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy/daydreaming
1	ok , i 'll admt it . when i first saw this movie , i was only 6 or 7 . i thought it dumb and pointless.i also thought 'omfg ! what was that teacup thing for ? it was soooooo pointless . this movie is stupid . ' now i am 13 , and i saw it again on abc family . then , i thought 'wow ! ' this movie is so cool ! i then understood what theteacups represented and everything . i thought it was a great movie . truely hilarious too . of course , it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world . but i never found it until now . this is a very cute movie and i really think anyone can enjoy it
0	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful `` eat drink man woman '' . frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first.. i just finished watching eat drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago . anyway , i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup , eat drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me . if you have n't seen either , see the better of the two ( exact same stories ) : eat drink man woman
1	this film seems to be known worldwide as a `` chick flick '' , from the romantic aspects of it , to the current anniversary dvd 's pink cover . i 'm an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film , especially due to the holly golightly character . after viewing this film for the first time , i developed a crush on the character holly ( kind of goofy , i guess , but it 's very hard for me to dislike a character like her . ) audrey hepburn played her to perfection . the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards . i love the film 's dialogue as well , it has a very realistic quality , and it 's so fun to hear the characters converse with each other . `` breakfast at tiffany 's '' is perhaps the best `` date '' movie ever conceived . this film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age .
1	for me , `` get a life '' provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy , from chris ' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien ( in home video volume 2 ) which is anything but cuddly . i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of `` get a life '' episodes
1	i had not heard of this production , so i had no expectations of it . i am a fan of the bbc literature miniseries , and the lead actor in this had a small , disagreeble role in `` wives and daughters . '' what a nice surprise to see him in such a positive role , so charming and sincere . he is wonderful here , complex and layered . i found this film to be an unexpected joy . the plot has many twists that went in unusual directions , the countryside vistas are gorgeous , it is like a rustic country vacation with a love story . if you want to find faults , there are always some to be found . the villian is handsome but one dimensional - and what is up with the `` soul patch '' beardlette and the hair ? the heroine is lovely , but really a bit too young to have the acting complexity to hold our interest for this long . one of the sisters has horrible modern highlighted blonde hair which many actresses have now , and it is the bane of period movies ... why did n't they fix that ? some of the plot points are silly and expected , but still ... overall , this is a delight , and the costumes , sets and villages feel authentic and isolated and real . at the half way point , the story completely surprised me and took us to a different place . how fun . this film is also a rare one ; in that i think both my parents would enjoy it . it is enough of a man 's story to hold my father 's interest , but enough of a woman 's story to keep it lively and lovely . much of the action is outdoors at some locations which are part of a national preserve/park which lend a fairytale quality to the action , perfect for this legend of a magical romance in a very real world . completely enjoyable
0	i too was n't very impressed with jarhead . i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines , and perhaps other branches of the military . for those of us who have n't i just do n't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested . as someone else mentione . i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket , but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
1	doris day is my all time favorite actress . her wonderful dancing , her beautiful voice , and her spectacular acting talent ! this movie is about melinda howard ( day ) she is coming over on a boat to new york to suprise her mother who is supposed to be famous on broadway and who she has n't seen in years . on the boat , she meets tom farnam who starts playing up the minute he sees her . but she gives him the brush off . so , she forgets about him , and arrives in new york . however when she comes to the fancy house that her mother puts on all her letters , she is suprised to find a strange man ( cuddles ) and his wife living there . and the butler sure is suprised when she comes bursting in asking for her mother ! but suddenly , the butler ( billy dewolfe ) , realizes who the girl is . because you see , the butler lefty , is a friend of her mother , who was famous on broadway , but really , now , is tough on luck , and sings at a bar ! both her and lefty , have done everythong in there power to keep this news from melinda , and our doing a swell job of it . they merely tell her that she has rented the house , and is on tour . which she believes . so , she decides to wait . after all , she says , i have n't saved up all this money to come to just leave ! so she waits . and who enters the picture again ? tom farnam ( gene nelson ) . and soon he and day fall in love . but not without troubles , which i will not spoil for you ! this movie includes wonderful dance sequences by day and nelson . also splendid songs . overall , this is a wonderful movie , and i recommend it highly !
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film : its narcissism . it 's gray 's defining characteristic . after a while , despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction ( he makes the best of a limited repertoire ) it just gets boring
0	i have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because i wanted my kids to see it . i was very young when i first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow . good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in asia . daryl hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid . tom was also perfect for the role . i ca n't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of tom hanks and meg ryan , though , but it was n't bad . i ca n't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie . i let my kids watch it finally together with my niece . we found ourselves teary-eyed in the end . it was just so touching , we could n't help it . even the theme song sang by rita coolidge was perfect for the ending . for those who wan na know , the title is `` love came for me '' . i 'm glad i purchased the anniversary edition . i have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what i needed . it would have been better if dts was used but i 'm not complaining . for those who are thinking of getting this , i hope you make the decision to do so . tom hanks is a certified great actor . this movie will soon be in line with the classics like `` gone with the wind '' and `` breakfast at tiffany 's '' . it 's already a collector 's item . you wo n't regret it ! besides , love stories do n't get out of style
0	i hoped i could leave the theatre , but i was hoping it would get better . here let me put it this way : 3-d sucked plot sucked actors sucked movie sucked please do n't make a sequel ! ! !
1	the pang of lost chances and the breakup of friendships made during shared experiences ... whether it be high school , college , or any specific period of life . everytime i see fandango , the experience and emotions of finishing college and leaving friends made during that time hits me all over again . as other reviewers have noted , the soundtrack is especially masterful ( the use of pat metheny during the wedding sequence is a particular favorite
1	along with the `` ultimate jordan '' dvd , this is a must buy for all jordan fans . while the ultimate jordan set has all of his earlier hits ; come fly with me , above and beyond , etc. , this dvd packs in the accolades of his final year as a chicago bull . there are more interviews and more candid insights with jordan compared with his earlier videos . the sound and video quality are top notch as well
0	i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school . this video made its rounds in the public schools . the songs are catchy and the film quality is good . but make no mistake , this is propaganda aimed at children . i will not be showing it to my kids . despite the freewheeling title , the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys . case in point : atalanta , a princess , finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world ( on her father 's horse ) . she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time . juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of `` ladies first . '' the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron . the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal . our `` hosts '' , infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas , are revolting . there should be a law against using mel brooks ' voice for a baby . apparently , i repressed memories of these creatures , but seeing them again brought back the horror . needless to say , i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry . overall , this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children
0	when i rented twentynine palms , i knew it would showcase bruno dumont 's taste for dispassionate portrayals , violence of various sorts , and shock . in spite of this mental preparation , this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me , a seasoned viewer , rattled . unfortunately , the shock and awe that the film achieves is short lived . twentynine palms is modeled on the horror film , but , like many of its american cousins , the horror it achieves failed to haunt me . the film as a whole left me with an unsettled feeling , as if a cynic had just talked my ear off . i also had the sense that this was more about the worldview of the director , rather than the world his film creates . sam peckinpaw 's straw dogs is in ways a similar but superior film . i can admire straw dogs based on its many strengths , so long as i avoid viewing it as the man-as-animal fable that peckinpaw intended . it is n't that i disagree with his view of humans as domesticated animals . i see the film as a rare example of violent drama and technical virtuosity transcending the simplicity of its maker 's defense . whether peckinpaw has a point or not seems beside the point . of course , the trick with any argument is in having good evidence . in pressing one 's point of view , there is , almost inevitably , an artful description of a scene , one that reflects the viewer 's position . in this way , films have the strange ability to create their own myths ; their own arguments . to invest a film with one 's views too forcibly can dull the work 's independent life , its peculiar logic , with the sententiousness of fables . watching twentynine palms , it seems impossible to avoid questioning dumont 's personal views . this is because so many of the events described in the film are implausible . lacking believable characters and action , one naturally develops a sense that the director is revealing something to us that we have n't seen ; something unique to his vision . if the strange behavior of the two principles was about their uniqueness and their relationship ( e.g . as outsiders ) then why would dumont undercut their characterization , denying us a belief in them as individuals , or , more profoundly , as points of identification ? i gradually came to view the two principles as an every-couple , with private rhythms and misunderstandings that might appear absurd if made public . this seemed like a worthy focus , but dumont forces it to play against a theme of violence , both seen and unseen . the violent atmosphere of the film was something i could n't account for until the resolution , and even then with difficulty . toward the end of film , we 're given a horrific equation of two orgasms : that of the male protagonist and that of his rapist , the film 's principle antagonist ( aside from the desert ) . both orgasms are shown to be dangerous , powerful , and unspeakable ( or , at least , not clearly worded ) . this equation discounts the context in which the orgasms occur , leaving the viewer with no reliable distinction of the protagonists from their insanely hostile environment . clearly , the bourgeois , carefree lifestyle of the couple is set up to be cut down ( a horror convention ) , but dumont makes the attack personal in the most perverse way . from early in the film on , the protagonists suggest an inner horror , which is unmitigated by their lovemaking , and perhaps even feeds on their relationship . the irrationality of their environment makes the couple our most recognizable guides on this strange road trip , but they demonstrate their own measure of insanity . the male half of the couple betrays an undercurrent of sadism that eventually explodes as an act of sexualized murder . the female 's deviance is less clearly defined , but there are several scenes in which she is shown inviting harm . if our trip , as it seems , is through a kind of anti-eden , and our guides are an every-couple , with no structured identity of their own , then their deviancy would suggest a kind of universal infection , or nature , rather than an aberration of character . this would also render the criminality of the final scenes uncertain , in light of their amoral setting . some would say that the best criterion for judging a horror film is whether it horrifies , regardless of how . this is an unsettling film . it is also an especially tasteless one . in watching this dvd , it may be useful to some viewers that dumont can be found rationalizing his use of violence ( indeed , his violence as an artist ) in an interview , in a director 's statement , and in the course of the film itself
0	... but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance . overall this is a stinker . mamet is not a good director . he should stick to writing
1	as popular as prince was in the 80 's , it 's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for under the cherry moon to find it 's way to dvd . critics largely considered the film a stinker , especially considering it was only two years behind purple rain , but under the cherry moon was a very good film , although very different than purple rain . shot in black and white , under the cherry moon starred prince as christopher tracey , him and his buddy tricky ( jerome benton from the time ) are living it up in europe . they wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money , basically they are gigolos . they swear it never gets personal until mary sharon comes into the picture . christopher falls for mary in a big way , but her father issac sharon is n't having it . drama ensues . the soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs `` u need another lover like you need a whole in your head , '' `` mountain , '' and `` kiss '' and the dvd includes the videos for the songs shot for the film . a must have for prince fans .
1	`` the changeling '' has become a little bit dated , however , it is still a very good ghost story . the film stars ( george c. scott ) as john russell , a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident . he rents a large estate in order to compose his music . it is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy . why is the boy haunting the estate ? why is he making contact with john russell ? as the film moves forward , john russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion . from what he can gather , it was the former home of senator carmichael ( melvin douglas ) . what ensues is the mystery of who the child is , and who is senator carmichael . what occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there ? this is more of a mystery than a horror film . the suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy 's wheelchair moves . the film is dated , and does not have the appeal it once had for me , however , it is still a good watch . recommended .
0	i watched anger management on the plane . since there is nothing else to watch , and the flight is more than ten hours , you usually watch whatever is on t.v . i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad , though there are some funny parts . there is some offensive language . overall , it 's a bad movie and is not worth watching .
0	i hated , hated , hated , hated this movie . it did n't make sense to me . to depresssing
0	save your $ 3.50 dvd rental fee . if you 're looking for a movie that will make you feel like city of angels made you feel , look elsewhere ! sorry , my vote is for hollywood . the director of wings admits that there was no script before shooting began . the extras that came with the wings dvd , interviews and info on berlin , were more entertaining than the movie .
0	ca n't understand what all the fuss is over this movie . it 's cute but so boring . i could hardly stay awake .
0	most of the time i love french films . 400 blows , breathless , etc . this one caught my eye so i bought it . waste of $ $ . horrible . i never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one . it was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound . i looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep .
1	this film is primarily a screwball comedy with dance and song numbers thrown in for good measure . the story concerns a ballet star ( fred astaire ) and a stage performer ( ginger rogers ) who may or may not be married depending on whom you ask . given the celebrity of the two parties involved hijinks and scandal ensue . both fred and ginger are in top comic form with their verbal sparring . need we redundantly state that they dance together exquisitely . good supporting cast includes the perpetually nervous edward everett horton , the droll eric blore , and jerome cowan ( `` the maltese falcon '' ) . good score by the gershwin brothers . you do not hear much about this film in the annals of screwball comedy probably because the principals are known primarily for their dancing . check this film out if you want to see a first rate comedy
1	ok i like horror movies and i like slashers movies and even if this is a low-buget slasher it works very well . the cast is unknowens so it gives you the feeling that any of them could die at anytime , and that helps . plus the guy in the mine suit with the pix-ax is very scarey . give it a try
1	the deep end is one of my top ten favourite films of 2001 . this moody , suspenseful and very intelligent suspense drama about a mother who finds herself in a terrifying situation with a couple of blackmailers is told with great subtletly and superb style . criticised by some as being logic free , i dont disagree that some plot turns are flawed ( eg anyone disposing of a body would not do so in such shallow water . why did the blackmailers presume that the main character could come up with $ 50,000.00 in less than 24 hours ? etc ) but the taut , effortless direction , inspired casting , elegant cinematography and surprising emotional depth make the deep end a superior and absorbing tale with characters who are truly complex and interesting to watch . the terrific performances only enhance the enjoyment as tilda swinton gives a masterly , fresh portrayal as margaret hall , a good , dedicated mother who will do anything for her children and goran visnijic who adds a real humanity to his role of alex spera , a initially cold hearted blackmailer whose conscious starts to kick in when he fully realises what he is doing to margaret and her family . supporting actors are also solid and raymond barry is convincingly menacing in his two scenes as spera 's more vicious crime partner . oh , and lake tahoe looks absolutely stunning , a unique and extremely effective backdrop for this film ' story . excellent .
1	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting .the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed . the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of `` everyone needs a maid '' only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour . i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner
0	before i get started with my review i must say one thing . im not just a mindless hater , trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise . i liked the original movies , with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman . with that being said here is why i really did n't like this movie . i felt it was too long and drawn out . too much time was spent on lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left . she whined to her reporter friend , she whined to her husband , she whined to clark kent , she whined to her boss , and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene . essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick . and although the soundtrack was stunning at times , too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play . yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough . basically im saying this movie was 90 % melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10 % action . and although the action scenes where pretty cool , it is nothing we have n't seen before in a superman flick , or any other super hero flick . acting wise , i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job , nothing compaired to reeves , but im not going to complain about that too much , he was servicable . and noone can complain about kevin spacey , he is just awesome , although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex . did not like louis lane . too whiney . story wise , this movie didnt really make much sense . it was way too out there . i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on . lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go `` yeah lets move there '' and lex is going to make lots of money . not likely . i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable . i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work . i mean most criminals want their power now , instant gratification . maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline , i just think they could have thought of something better , and more feasable . this movie was alright , it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away . and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies , cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie . however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book
0	this film is evocative of the quirky , madcap robert altman at his best and worst . we got it because we have a bud cort fan in the family , and just to see him makes it worth it . but the story is strange , resolution less than satisfying . if you 're really a big altman or cort fan , then you must see it . just be aware that this is not a western ! ( i had it confused with john wayne 's `` rooster cogburn '' and the dennis weaver 's `` mccloud '' and kept waiting for it to start , thinking i was seeing more previews . ) the storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the astrodome who is trying to fly , with a murder mystery and detective story . this is one of shelly duvall 's early roles -- do n't miss her upside-down false eyelashes
1	if you are a fan of horror movies , the old ec comic books , stephen king , or just fun movies in general , than look no further than this 1982 classic ! ================================================= the movie ( 5/5 ) : `` creepshow '' is an anthology of scary stories -- five of them -- that is bridged together by a sixth tale of a boy who loves horror comics and his abusive dad who hates them . the movie features pitch-perfect performances by an all-star 80 's cast that seems to be having a lot of fun being in this scream of a movie . the stories are as follow : 1 . `` father 's day '' ( 4.5/5 ) stars carrie nye , ed harris , and viveca lindfors . easily the cheesiest of the five stories ( but still a lot of fun ) , father 's day tells the tale of a family reunion from hell when a long-dead dad rises from the grave for his `` caaaaaaakkeeeee '' ( and for a little good old fashioned zombie revenge ) . 2 . `` the lonesome death of jordy verrill '' ( 4/5 ) stars stephen king . although its easily the weakest of the stories , it 's probably also the most original , so keep your finger off the fast-forward button . stephen king ( ! ) gives a nutty and throughly enjoyable performance as a country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife from a meteroite that touches down in his backyard . sounds weird ? you do n't know the half of it . 3 . `` something to tide you over '' ( 5/5 ) stars leslie nielsen , ted danson , and gaylen ross . this segment is legendary . leslie nielsen gives the performance of his life as a psychotically jealous husband who takes a notion to bury his wife and her lover neck-deep in sand before the tide rolls in . needless to say , love is more powerful than death , as our antihero soon finds himself neck deep in terrifying troubles of his own . 4 . `` the crate '' ( 5/5 ) stars hal holbrook , adrienne barbeau , and fritz weaver . hands down the best tale of terror , it 's no wonder that the three main actors of this single story also receive top billing in the picture 's opening credits . this epic blood-soaked tale of insanity , fear , and fidelity is a timeless classic with excellent performances all around , and an unforgettable monkey-like demon from special effects master tom savini . the longest segment of the film , `` the crate '' tells the story of henry ( holbrook ) , a college professor with an unbelievably obnoxious and domineering wife ( a brilliant performance by barbeau ) . when henry 's colleague dexter stanley ( weaver ) discovers a flesh-eating monster under the stairway under the stairs of the college and informs henry , the henpecked husband makes plans to use the monster to his own domestic advantage . this out-of-this-world premise carries very real themes of love and death , friends and family , and moral responsibility versus personal hapiness . with subtle undertones that just hint at the depth of this brilliantly written horror masterpiece , stephen king has never been more entertaining than with this perfectly crafted tale . 5 . `` they 're creeping up on you '' ( 4.5/5 ) stars e.g . marshall . bringing us back down for a soft landing , romero and king conclude their horror anthology with this wonderfully bizarre tale of a millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ-proof apartment is overwhelmed with an army of cockroaches . this one goes way over the top , but it all keeps with the tempo of the movie . if you know somebody who is deathly afraid of bugs , try showing them the final scene of this segment , then sit back and enjoy their screams of bewilderment . all in all , i 'd have to say creepshow is one of the top three horror films ever made . rent it or buy it today ! ================================================= the disc ( 1/5 ) : unfortunately , the `` geniuses '' over at warner bros. have insulted this fine film and its fans by offering up a very lame disc . the picture quality is only passable , the letterbox formatting is kind of funky , and there are absolutely no extras , save for a trailer , which i do n't really count as a real feature . the only good thing i can possibly say about the disc is that it 's got 41 chapters , but only 21 of those are accesible with the disc . while we 'll have to wait for `` creepshow '' to get the same special edition treatment as its inferior sequel , this bare bones disc only goes to show the strength of the film in the fact that even with no bonuses at all , `` creepshow '' is still one of the most rewatchable and indispensable horror movies on the market
1	only the lonely is a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes , john candy , ally sheedy , maureen o'hara , anthony quinn and milo o'shea . the movie is about a irish american cop who lives in boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother does n't like . this is a cute movie and i 'm glad that they finally have put it on dvd
0	please think this dvd is recorded in 1986 . more worse , this is recorded as a documentary . sound quality is worst . after i bought this and dvd of `` company '' ( same , worst sound quality documentary ) , i suspect the word `` concert '' or `` soundtrack '' in dvd title
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
1	this is an excellent movie for the romantic type . a real classic ! got it for my wife for her birthday . enjoyed it very much
0	this is pure drivel ! ! ! ! ! clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film ; like the director wasnt given enough money to make it , so he thought , you know what , im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film , that 'll show them.the `` plot '' , if i can re-tell it without vomiting , is thus : a plane is struck by lightning , and kills all the pilots ... ... ... ... ..i kind of lost what was going on after that ... ... the ending , if there actually was one , was that whatever predicament they were in , they got out of.where can i begin ? ? ? ? ? clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics , as they 'd have pointed out that this isnt possible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! im a little bit rusty on my physics , but isnt it called a faraday coil ? ? ? if not then forgive me , my minds a little indestinct , but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane . `` what about the glass , it passed through the glass window ! ! ! '' you bark smugly , well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people , you ever been hit by lightning indoors ? ? have you ever heard of this happening in real life before ? ? no , because it cant ! ! ! ! ! ! well done , you 're learning.anyway , enough of the banter , the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop , the cable ( ? ? ! ! ) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense , some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish , a hint of romance between a `` criminal '' and a `` female human being '' , and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says `` i skipped bail '' , '' are you a criminal ? '' she asks ! ! ! ! ! ! well of course he is you stupid fool , he just told you ! ! ! ! any time there was `` turbulence '' the camera was wobbled about a bit , and the `` actors '' moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments , where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car , that was brilliant ! ! ! ! he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead ... then later he gave the oxygen mask , great ! ! ! ! ! all the scenes involving the radar room , they were something else ! ! ! ! the ending also , the rubbish cgi aeroplane , what a laugh ! ! ! ! i could go on and on and on , pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film , but i think ive said enough.in short , dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash , then this is definately for you ! ! ! ! i laughed nearly all the way through it , so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5
0	this movie does n't have a single scene worth watching . femalien 1 is in another league , do n't waste your time on the sequel
0	shameless rip-off of `` jungle taitei '' ( `` kimba the white lion '' ) by tezuka . any anime lover can tell . ( similarities in characters , scenes , and story lines are unbelievable . ) disney 's response ? `` never heard of kimba . '' oh , purleese . i 'm kicking myself for paying disney for this piece of swindle
1	this 1955 release is one of those smaller akira kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of his bigger films like `` rashomon '' and `` seven samurai '' but it 's still worth seeing . the great toshiro mifune plays an industrialist in post-world war ii japan who is slowly going mad with the notion that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family ( and his mistresses ) to flee japan with him . mifune 's obsessive portrayal is the stuff of great tragedy especially as he vainly pleads with his greedy family to leave and takashi shimura , the samurai leader in `` seven samurai '' , is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten the mess out . the movie captures japanese dread about the atom bomb , a subject kurosawa would also treat in his masterpiece , `` ikiru '' , very well and with the greedy family closing in on a raving patriarch , brings to mind `` king lear '' , a tale the director would go back to many years later in `` ran '' . this is a small film from one of the world 's great directors but a very good one
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
1	the amazing thing about commentaries is that you get to discover things you never thought you would , for instance ... why the screenwriter used the title dead again : its based on a story he read about a woman saying she was pregnant with her reincarnated husband . anyways , enough of trivia . this film is a great ride.branagh is so skilled in acting and crafting of film , theatre etc , that he had to come into mainstream films at some stage . so , he was working hard in theatre , and he ( and his wife ) discover a script about a murder that gives rise to events recurring years later . this film 's cast is superb . if you listen to kenneth branagh 's commentary , you will discover the most amazing connections . and throughout , they talk of this as a noir film , well , i have no idea what that is , but this film is a great entertaining piece , and it is in no small part to branagh , emma thompson , derek jacobi ( brought in 3 days before he was asked to start , a last minute call ) , and others who made a wonderful film , and a solid entertaining piece . the dvd extras are just the commentaries , but for this type of film , thats fine , since that is complex enough . enjo
1	this film motivated me to do my own research and i read as much material on the case as i could possibly find -- especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty . to be honest , i had a natural skepticism about the west memphis three 's claims of innocence . a coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her `` friends '' who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder . i refused to believe it at first . but it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive . still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends ' innocence . when all is done and said - it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts . first , please allow me to correct a few misconceptions from some of the other reviewers . the michael moore mentioned in the credits refers to one of the little eight-year-old child murder victims , not the filmmaker . a couple of reviewers mentioned a necklace worn by damien echols which supposedly had blood on it from some of the victims . actually , nothing more determinable than common blood types was found . one almost microscopic spot on the pendant was consistent with the blood type of damien echols ( one of the accused ) , the other micro-spot was consistent with the blood type shared by both jason baldwin ( one of the accused ) and steven branch ( one of the eight-year-old victims ) -- as well as 11 % of the rest of the caucasian population of the united states . all experts agree that tiny micro-spots of blood can be transferred by a number of ways -- especially a teenage boy wearing the necklace against their bare skin . police photos verify that jason baldwin had also worn damien 's necklace . police photos taken two days after the crime -- show damien without his shirt and reveal absolutely no cuts , abrasions or scratches whatsoever . the closest thing to credible evidence the prosecution could manage to produce were four very tiny fibers found in the houses of damien 's family and jason 's family which were deemed by the prosecution to be microscopically similar to fibers from two of the victims . but even the prosecution 's expert witness , lisa sakevicius a criminologist from the state 's crime laboratory acknowledged that this was inconclusive and could have just as well come from mass-produced products obtained off the shelves of the local wal-mart . furthermore , charles linch of the southwestern institute of forensic science in dallas refuted the claims of microscopic similarities in his testimony . no fibers whatsoever were found in the home of jessie 's family . during the appeal process forensic scientists examining the crime scene photos and autopsy photos identified human bite marks on two of the victims . this was confirmed by a forensic odontologist . teeth impressions were taken from the three young men in prison . none of these teeth impressions from damien , jason and jessie matched these bite marks found on the victims . the highly coerced `` confession '' from jessie misskelly jr. ( a 17-year-old borderline retarded boy with an iq of 71 ) was so filled with obvious errors that it is an obscenity that it was treated as the basis for making these arrest . i should mention that this so-called `` confession '' came after submitting this boy to a 12 hour grueling without lawyers , parents or counsel of any kind and included a polygraph test which he had passed but was told by the police that he had failed . judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear about these interrogation techniques . jessie misskelly jr. refused to testify in court against jason baldwin and damien echols stating that he simply `` was not going to get up there and tell a bunch of lies '' . this was in spite of an offer to remove his life sentence . read dan stidham 's ( jessie 's lawyer ) case synopsis by copying and pasting the web address below : http : //www.wm3.org/live/caseintroduction/synopsis_dan.php the scenario painted by the police and the prosecutors against the three teenagers is simply a scientific impossibility . how on earth could there have been the massive blood loss caused by ceremonial satanic cult killings of three persons in the middle of the night without leaving one single micro-speck of blood or any other body fluids at the scene ? did they sneak in the fbi forensic team to clean up after them when nobody was looking ? luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where the police had laid or transported the bodies . it should also be mentioned that none of the scarce shoe prints at the scene matched jason , jessie or damien either . . for a scientific view -- see this crime scene analysis and profile by one of america 's leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight on who might have actually committed the crime . i must warn you - it is a bit gruesome to say the least : copy and paste this web address : http : //www.arwar.org/wm6caseinformation/turveyequivocaldeathanalysisandprofile.html so let us briefly summarize . much of the so-called evidence was based on the notion that damien admitted an interest in the wicca religion and the occult which many local people perceived as satanism . this is not evidence of committing murder . you can go to any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere in middle america and find plenty of books on such subjects . furthermore , neither jason nor jessie had ever expressed any particular interest in wicca or the occult . both damien and jason wore mostly black clothes and loved heavy metal music . so what ? the police actually confiscated 15 black t-shirts from jason 's home as evidence to prove god knows what . damien was undoubtedly a troubled teenager from a troubled family . he was a bit of a wise-ass teenager . he wrote some morbid poetry . so what ? a couple of young girls claimed months after the fact that they had heard damien say that he committed the murders . any reasonable-objective person listening to those testimonies would have found them implausible to put it politely . a young burglar/drug addict who was in the juvenile detention facility claimed that the shy and reserved 16-year-old jason confessed to him the second time they ever met ghastly stories about drinking blood from the genitals of a murdered child while worshipping the devil . the counselor from that facility warned the prosecution that this young man was not credible and gave them detailed reasons . and there is no evidence that jason and this young man ever met . even if they did -- the story is ridiculous . still , judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear counter-testimony or information that could have challenged the credibility of this witness . the so-called `` confession '' of jessie and the scenario put forward by the police and prosecution would have involved massive amounts of blood left at the scene . there was not even one tiny micro-spec . that is a physical impossibility . the simple fact is all forensics were either exonerating or completely inconclusive . `` there was a lack of physical evidence to tie anyone or anything to the crime scene . '' -- john fogleman , prosecutor of the west memphis three -- sadly , the west memphis police would not do anything more than a cursory and disinterested investigation of the most obvious suspect . ( see the forensic profile mentioned above ) probably because that obvious suspect who had a violent history including family violence and a lifetime as a penny-anny career criminal was also an undercover narcotic informant who was in a very tight relationship with the west memphis police . anyway , for god sakes -- see this film along with paradise lost 2 and read devils knot . . this is not a political film . this case has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative , democrat or republican , left or right or even whether you support or oppose the death penalty . i hope that we of all political persuasion agree that locking up the wrong people and letting the real killers get away is a very bad idea . for an in-depth analysis of all details of this case-see these two websites . and if it touches your conscience please consider trying to help : http : //www.wm3.org/live/caseinfo/index.php http : //www.arwar.org/wm6.html
1	these early thirties films labelled as `` pre code '' , are always most interesting to watch from a historical perspective as only a few years after this film was made such a topic would never have been able to be presented as it is here . the passage of time of course makes the subject matter of mgm 's `` the divorcee '' , seem tame however back in 1930 this story was considered very adult and almost ahead of its time in its fairly honest examination of the `` expected '' , roles for husbands and wives in the marital situation . norma shearer who today is sadly not well known really proved her acting chops in this vehicle and went home with the best actress oscar that year for her troubles . often labelled quite restrictively as the dignified first lady of mgm resulting from much of her later work in this decade in husband irving thalberg 's prestige productions ; here proves what she was capable of doing on screen when given meaty roles to tackle . her other effort from this time `` a free soul '' , makes a nice companion piece to `` the divorcee '' , in illustrating the range of roles shearer was capable of handling when examining her overall career .
1	this is a great movie full of adventure and excitement . pokemon 4 ever takes place during the period of the time when ash is in the juto league . in pokemon forever ash must protect the beautiful pokemon celbi from the evil iron masked marador of team rocket . in this movie you get to she something you never got to she before professor oak as a little boy . if you are 7 or older than this movie is fine for you . if you are under 7 this movie may be to intense and violent for you to handle . my favorite part in this movie is when celebi makes the twig monsters and start destroying the forrest . attribute to toho who created godzilla . if you enjoy this you the other pokemon movies . i also recomend digmon the movie . this movie also features a short chute little min movie called pikchu 's pekaboo which should be fine for kids age 7 an up
1	this is a masterpiece of cinema . after watching robert mulligan 's more famous ( to me ) movies : to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 , i found this jewel . i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is . directors like ford , hawks , lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone , and so is cinema as art , but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it , although it may only last a blink of an eye . i am off to check out `` come september '' now . who is this robert mulligan , anyway ? lovable little gem
1	great shows about binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself . there 's a cycling champion , vance legstrong , who inspires him to succeed ( wonder who that character is modeled after ) . 'operation dw ' is about dw having surgery to get tubes put in her ears . some really funny stuff in this one but that 's pretty much par for the course with the dw based episodes
1	apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime , the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment . it also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons . the governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute , and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and tv cameras . this is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign just for that reason it is unethical . the film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication of his grandson . he finally realizes , as he says so well , that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson . there was a new hope in that man . but that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor . dr jacques coulardeau , universit paris dauphine , universit paris i panthon sorbonne
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
1	best series out there on any sci-fi show , makes you think and imagine the worlds out there in the universe . this is a good after thought of star trek
1	the breakfast club , one of the best movies out there . timless no matter what 's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie ! : -
0	well ... do n't know where to start ... ... bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it , stuart gorden is director ... ..and they did a good job on re-animator . but let me tell you , horror freaks will be disapointed . only one really bloody scene is worth watching ... not because of the blood , not because of the gore ... ..just , because it is the only bloody scene in the movie ... a nice looking woman is eaten by the `` castel freak '' ... .. if you have seen re-animator , the evil dead , from beyond , hellraiser and maybe the thing , then skip this one..you will be disapointed like me ... . even a john woo action movie has more blood in it ... ..
0	as a big fan of ralph , i was looking forward to the end of the affair . maybe my expectations were too high , but this movie is dreadful . ralph is a brilliant actor , but not even his flawless acting ca n't compensate for the nonsensical plot and the horrific casting of julianne moore . what happened to moore ? it is not hard to learn a british accent . from the sounds of it , moore did n't even try . she sounds so american she fails to convince anyone she has an ounce of english in her . and if that were n't bad enough , the plot is as unconvincing as moore 's accent . she 's an adulteress , but miraculously heals a young boy 's facial disfigurement and brings ralph back from the dead . even the priest admires her -- adultery and all ! her husband does not know the meaning of jealously and lets ralph live in the house even though he knows of the affair . still amidst the unbelievable , the plot is so predicatable . she coughs a few times here and there . so we know ( before anyone in the movie figures it out ) that she 's dying . we also know why she `` ends '' the affair long before its `` revealed '' to ralph . and by the way , what was with all the nudity ? totally unnecessary and vulgar
0	this is only a portion of this episode . it cuts off in the middle of a sentence
1	classic walter matthau film . i enjoyed it very much because of the easy believeable relationship between matthau hawn , the suppressed attraction between bergman matthau the sweet storyline . this film was made during a time where special effects did n't fill in for weak plots ; instead the story actually makes its point . well done . as bachelor dentist dr. julian winston , matthau tries to convince his mistress , toni , ( goldie hawn ) that he has a wife who wo n't divorce him because they have children . toni 's had enough : she fires off a letter ( yes , actually walks across the street in her nightgown to deposit the letter in a mailbox ) to julian , telling him she 's committed suicide . her young writer-neighbor , igor ( rick lenz ) , smells gas in the apartment hallway , breaks in saves toni . when julian receives the letter at his office , he storms off to toni 's apartment , only to find her alive in the company of igor . this little stunt persuades julian to ask toni to marry him -- he 'll get a divorce no matter what . the catch is now toni wants to meet julian 's wife , she has to get to know her so that julian 's wife wo n't think of toni as a home-wrecker . enter ingrid bergman as miss stephanie dickinson , dr. winston 's long-suffering , never-married dental assistant . julian convinces stephanie to pose as his wife for toni . what ensues is a calamity of coincidences misunderstandings that cause true feelings to be revealed . ingrid bergman is such a joy to watch , she effortlessly steals the show . if you want light-hearted entertainment that will leave you with a smile on your face , this film is for you
1	from the first day i watched this video , i have picked up so many musical ideas to apply to nearly every genre of music i play ( and , being a military rock band bassist , i play a lot of different genres ) . this video will , without a doubt , help you become a better player
1	note : 4 1/2 stars is what i mean . this is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see . you can watch this film without sound or subtitles and still be enraptured . the breathtaking landscapes , the gorgeous use of colors , the wonderful costume design , the stunning dance and fight choreography will captivate you like few films do . the musical score is excellent , it enhances the mood of the scenes even further . the acting is also very convincing , your hearts will go out to these characters . the story is simple , but has some interesting twists , and is told very well . compared to most movies there is very little dialogue , but you wo n't miss it . words are never wasted , every line seems essential . my only qualm is with the final unfolding of events which are not bad , but were not up to the level of the rest of the film . target audience : anyone who does n't mind subtitles .
1	this is an inspiring movie to all americans at this stage of the war vs japan ... in reality , 4 of the captured usaaf crew were beheaded , others tortured unmercifuly ... 3 survived at war 's end ... with the release of , `` the purple heart '' at christmas time [ 1944 ] well after the gen doolittle raid in april 1942 , it hit home and in our hearts to the heroics of our courageous united states army air force and naval forces in harm 's way ... this movie depicts japan for all of her quick grabs in the pacific war ; yet , japan was wide open and vunerable to air attack ... it helped lift our morale to perservere , sacrifice and no more surrenders , ultimately paving the way for japan 's unconditional surrender forevermore in aug/1945 ... it was not a propaganda movie ; conversely , a cornerstone film for total victory over japan who was our most formidable and cunning enemy we ever faced on the sea and on the land ... dana andrews stirring lecture to that japanese judge rang true as the `` usaaf will blackened your skies , day and nite we 'll come to burn your cities to the ground and wipe your dirty little empire off the face of the earth '' ... that was a truism and justly so ... sadly , today 's liberal americans ca n't relate or comprehend to just what a united effort it took to bring the japanese militarists to extinction in aug/1945 ... the japanese got what they readily deserved with a-bomb interest ... this movie was a harbinger of what was to come to the home-islands of japan ... ww2 was a great american lesson to america 's enemies ... i loved this wartime 1944 film about wartime april/1942 ... .ssgt chris sarno-usmc fm
0	i was very excited to see another valentine horror movie coming out ; the last one i remember was my bloody valentine about some cole minor named harry nabob or something like that , very bad film . but valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending . the pretty boy being the killer again is just played out . scream was good everything else is just redundant . imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that . he goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society , but escaped is much better . this masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one , then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged . i give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and i can always pretend the ending was good
1	early louis malle film based on the true life story of per jacques . the film brings to life an understanding of true martyrdom . this is the stuff of saints such as maximilian kolbe , edith stein , and pere jacques
1	just one of those classics i 'm in the mood for once in a while , and needed to replace my vhs version . excellent copy on cd , very happy with it .
0	the movie title itself says a lot , the movie itself is a total scam , fools people to rent or to watch it . a horrible directing , script and performance . you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie
1	if you love whoopi goldberg and i do , you will love this movie
0	if you want uncut original version , always look for original licensed production . not us release . its a foreign film , it should not be us version to begin with~ ! hello ! ! ! ? ? why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie 's fighting scenes . and us release ruins the speed and sound as well . i have been collecting jet li movies both hk and us release version for quite some time now . i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable , and higher in quality . american market always like to `` americanize '' and `` control '' . regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market . why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it ? ? no one makes hollywood american movies to `` french version '' or `` chinese version '' ~ ! this what americans are doing~ ! well , enjoy the cheap `` american version '' then~ ! lo
1	my cousin recommended for me to watch this movie . it will keep you on the edge of your set , like it did me . this is one movie that you do n't wan na miss , go out an buy or rent this
0	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen , of course , but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x-person or a bond-busting sadist . this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh . and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt . carter from gomer pyle - totally implausible . i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them
1	i love this classic type of sci-fi movie that was a really well written story . i know it seems corny now but at the time it was a really cool movie
1	as far as im concerned doris can do no wrong and this is one of those extra special films of the 60 's that she did ... probably better than if ( dare i say ) marilyn had done the movi
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes , like many others here in unbox . do they think their customers are so dumb ? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd ? what sense does this make ? what a disappointment this service is..
0	foul . just plain foul . seemingly never-ending..and not in a good way . tasteless . sick . not even worth the beautiful faces . heck , i ca n't even write a proper review because i refused to finish the worthless trash-could n't tell you what it was about .
0	if this is the generation i am supposed to belong to , i want to disown it . ben stiller 's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage , and are now trying to find their way in the world . the movies messege is that we are a lost generation , but that is not are parent 's fault ( where this movie tries to lay the blame ) . the kids in this movie are just lazy , more or less . and they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives . indeed , troy ( ethan hawke ) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him . winona ryder plays waify lelina , who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends . one day she meets michael ( ben stiller ) who is their age but has made a good career out of the tv industry . ethan hates him for his honest approach to life , and so the battle for lelina 's love begins . i really was n't too impressed with this movie , it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool , tortured artist ; when they should get off the couch and go get a job
1	i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat . they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis . why though , must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again ? i suspect ( and hope ) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you do n't already own any of these and are a fan of broadway , theatre or the performing arts in general , buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent
1	i have studied kenpo karate and several other disciplines of martial science , and i can say honestly that this movie is accurate . my father , who is a former kenpo instructor , and i both recognize things from the movie . kenpo is an ancient martial art from about 2000 years ago that was formed by combining the major martial arts of the time , such as kung fu , tae kwon do , and ju jitsu . last century , though , an outstanding martial artist named ed parker became an expert in kenpo and `` americanized '' it . jeff speakman was ( as i have been corrected ) a 4th degree black belt in american kenpo . he does an excellent job of keeping what is in the movie real . i especially like how a history and the philosophy of kenpo is given during the scene in which he is shown learning kenpo . but , do n't take my word for it , go see the movie . i know that a lot of people have gotten rid of the vhs players , but if you have one get this movie . the plot is decent , and the fighting is incredible .
1	i thought that supernatural would just be another sci-fi thriller , but then i started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development . i think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone
0	will not play once video was downloaded . i get the error message : `` can not play file , please try again later . error # 0x80040273 '' i made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the unbox department was already closed , i was told the unbox saturday and sunday 6-5 hours . i have to say i am impressed with the call back feature . i downloaded the unbox beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem . thanks amazon unbox ! i will update again - feb. 10,200
0	i could n't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking . the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do ? mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective . to be honest i did n't finish the entire film , but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing
1	the traveling plot seemed like a take-off of 'trains , planes , and automobiles ' - traveling from ny to savannah vs traveling from chicago to ny . same sequence : airplane delays , then train occurrence , then bus , then jalopy-type car . but , since i totally enjoyed the steve martin movie , i also enjoyed 'forces of nature ' . the writer even threw in some weather and fire , same as 'trains , planes , and automobiles ' . because of the similarities , i rated it four stars instead of five . i thought the movie was cute and i like both sandra bullock and ben affleck . i saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good-looking person to whom we 've been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony , but ben was , indeed , committed to his fiance and to his future , which was a positive attribute on his behalf . unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void , i felt it was very much stated in this movie , in spite of other 's around them having their own relationships fall apart . sarah 's life was to be her son and her relationship with him - to build it up after some years of absence . the movie ended correctly . everyone got what they wanted . gail gupton , author : 'the 31-day diet of spiritual enlightenment ' , and 'seekers of truth ' .
0	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows . this service should be open to all amazon users ... ... ! ! ! ! ! !
1	cary grant was a great actor with countless memorable films . although that this film is not amongst his very best , it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure . it is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some disney influence . but grant offers us one of his typical ( in a good sence ) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs . enjoy it
1	let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime . the plot is basically a cybernetic government agent , major motoko kusanagi , who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called `` the puppet master '' . from start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline . i think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough . there is a lot of violence and some language . also , some slight nudity , but very non-sexual . overall , i think this is one of the best anime ever
1	even though this is about 4 years old , it is extremely halarious . i 've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy . the first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another . i love this guy
0	foul . just plain foul . seemingly never-ending..and not in a good way . tasteless . sick . not even worth the beautiful faces . heck , i ca n't even write a proper review because i refused to finish the worthless trash-could n't tell you what it was about .
1	this movie is a classic - a young ( er ) nicholas cage is fun to watch , as is the entire cast ! one of my favorites to watch over and over ! !
0	i remember managing to find a drive-in that was showing the first run eceg ; and i remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched . she was too kind . in retrospect , it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it . i say almost . it was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is : at least the elvis impersonators will leave it alone . the story is weak , the co-stars are painful , and the soundtrack so bad , the weakest selling record of elvis ' career managed to kill of the extended playing record . but , for all that , it is elvis , and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away . its just best watched alone .
0	man , there 's no way to describe this movie . slow , boring , unidimensional , bad plot , really bad acting ... really low-budget ( in a bad way ) i 'm not gon na get my time or my money back . i bought it based on the reviews , and they were really off ... even if you enjoy the gothic ambience , believe me , it 's really bad . you 've been warned
1	what i find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that mr. moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts , and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void . the man is not only making a video to entertain you ( and this is wildly entertaining , in a factual and hilarious way ) but it also rests in an unarguable fact , the closure of the gm plants in flint michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it . whether or not you like they style of moore 's presentation , it is witty , backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of flint at this loss of future revenue ( or , more bluntly , its threatened economic survival ) and in the joining the impact that corporate america can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated , dollars and cents approach to the bottom line , moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other , as you often can not have one without having both .
1	this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li . its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting . jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie . it has laughter , suspense , compassion , and innocense . the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn . this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger , hidden dragon . an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection
1	another great powell/loy collaboration this time with loy as an heiress who 's suing a newspaper for $ 5m after they ran a story about her being a husband stealer - she 's not . spencer tracy runs the paper and with nowhere else to turn he hires powell to romance loy and prove that she is a husband stealer ... problem is powell ai n't married , so he quickly marries tracy 's girlfriend ( jean harlow ) . the second problem is loy is extremely smart and cautious , so powell has to get his foot in the door via her father who 's obsessed with trout fishing . powell fakes being an expert trout fisherman with hilarious but successful results . once he gets to loy he falls madly in love with her and on top of that harlow falls in love with powell ! great fun , but unfortunately the picture on this dvd is n't the best and the lack of extras in insulting
1	this a classic john carpender film but defentaly one that needs a sequel by him . the skill with which action mixed with heavy metal music is excellent . as far as i 'm concerned everyone in this si-fi horror thriller did their job right . i could feel it , be it , live it . it could be real . each character brought something essential to this film . i 'm not the only one that likened the martian leader to a cross between marilyn manson and rob zombie . there are very powerful fight survival scenes with just enough blood and gore to freak you out and keep you on edge . who will get possessed next ? a must see . more than once to notice all of the effects , and believe me they are powerfull . watch it and see who lives and who dies and how . great work mr. carpender
1	the words `` accesibility '' and `` fun '' do not often go together with jean-luc godard . he is one of the most important directors in the history of the cinema , but he is not always easy for mainstream audiences - or even the arthouse crowd - to digest . happily , une femme est une femme [ a woman is a woman ] , one of his most important films , and one of the key movies of the french new wave of the 1960s is a blast from beginning to end , demonstrating that you do not have to be awkward or alienate your viewers to be brilliant . for one thing , it 's a comedy - and a genuinely funny one , with some hilarious scenes involving the `` gender war '' . there are particularly excellent scenes in which jean-claude brialy and the always watchable anna karina as the main couple are determined not to talk to each other and instead resort to showing each other book titles to express themselves . it 's godard 's first film in colour and widescreen , which makes a refreshing change from his usual monochrome , square vision of cinema , and it 's innovative and moves along at a lightning pace as if it 's determined to head off the smallest amount of boredom in its audience before it even emerges . godard does some fascinating things with graphics : text appears on screen betraying the characters ' true emotions as they effortlessly lie to each other . it 's a very playful movie , with a few in-jokes that newcomers to the french new wave will perhaps miss ; there are a couple of affectionate digs at fellow new waver francois truffaut . in one scene a main character asks a minor character `` how are jules and jim '' ( truffaut 's movie of the same year . ) she replies `` moderate . '' and there are self-references too . jean-paul belmondo 's character at one point complains that he needs to leave because he wanted to watch a bout de souffle on tv . ( he was in a bout de souffle . it 's godard 's first film . ) characters talk directly to the camera , bow , at one point anna karina seems to be about to burst into song and the whole movie about to turn into a hollywood musical ( the film is said to be godard 's tribute to that much-loved genre , although it 's more about the love of movies in general . ) there 's also some very peculiar , and funny work with the incidental music which rises up and cuts out during perfectly mundane conversations to give them a little extra spice and drama . and there 's brialy riding his bike around his apartment for no apparent reason . the plot , by the way , is ( as so often with godard ) secondary to the delivery of the movie - its techniques , its quirks , and its innovations . but the style is so effective you wo n't mind that . and it 's a very satisfying 80 or so minutes which will leave you with a smile on your face at the end . very pleasing that one of the most important films of the french new wave is also , alongside demy 's sung-through , technicolor musical parapluies de cherbourg [ umbrellas of cherbourg ] , one of its most enjoyable . well worth the attention of both the godard admirer and the newcomer .
1	thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of `` my wife says ... '' jokes . your wife is fat and ugly and i do n't care what she says . because she 's ugly . and fat ... ..and not my wife
1	this is a real rarity -- a cinematic adaptation of a literary work that is just as good as the original novella from which the film came . filmmaker gary walkow ( he co-wrote the screenplay , executive produced , and directed the film ) has created a real gem in this brilliant translation of the best known short work by dostoevsky into film . the casting is pitch perfect . henry czerny -- perhaps best known for his portrayal of the weaselly fed in the harrison ford blockbuster clear and present danger -- is the right choice to play the underground man , someone who despises himself so much that almost every interaction he has with another human being is full of rancor , bitterness , cynicism , and/or outright loathing . sheryl lee is the prostitute whom he `` befriends '' and ultimately and violently rejects from his life . jon favreau is the pompous rich guy who humiliates the underground man and merely laughs when the latter tries to humiliate him back . the alternation of present ( shown , effectively , with a blue filter as the underground man video records himself ) with the past ( shown in full color -- signifying time gone by including a fantasy of what could have been ) is also extremely effective . the extras included on the disk are superior . there are not one but two commentaries -- one by walkow and czerny , and the other by professor joseph frank of princeton university . professor frank also provides a commentary independent of the film itself which is accompanied by stills from the film ; this is an abridged version of the full-length commentary . there is also a full-length essay by professor deborah martin of columbia university , analyzing the film sequence by sequence . this makes for a truly rewarding cinematic experience and one , i am sure , that is a good fit for university instruction in dostoevsky . it 's fitting , perhaps , that the last sequence of the film pulls back from the blue-lensed perspective of the underground man filming himself so that we see a group of students watching him on several monitors . this is a very clever cinematic trick by walkow , but is not done just to be clever ; it provides an insightful view of the theme of the work itself -- egoism and how it traps us inside ourselves . by offering a view from outside , the filmmaker is indicating , perhaps , that we can view someone caught up in his own egoism and maybe learn from his experience . on the other hand , it could mean that since here we are , students -- and by extension , viewers at home -- watching the underground man rant about his own shortcomings -- we 're essentially caught in the same egoistic trap he 's in . the difference is -- he rants about it . we just sit and watch him . highly recommended
1	hello world , wowee zowee , very `` wacky '' little gem . remember seeing the cover when my dad took me into the video store , i was around 6 or 7 and it stuck in my mind . when i was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on beta tape , so i borrowed it cause i still have a beta ( really should n't have mentioned that ) . a true slasher basher not for the timid , truly written and directed by booby hatch patients , and were they found the actors is beyond me ! filmed in georgeous new jersey of course not far from the original friday the 13th . its a real winner ! ! ! creepiest mom ever . love her old dodge or plymouth ?
0	i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place , perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story . however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly ( in a stupid way ) .the action scenes were terrible . i recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies .
0	why , oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of crime punishment with john hurt , using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime john simm . i would download the 2002 version all day , everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair . either offer me the version i want , or get the pictures right
0	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it . it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time . if you thought she was bad in scream ... and friends..dont watch this ... there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it . hopefully this show will be scraped
0	maybe it 's because he is such a stright shooter ( pun ment ) or something but clint does n't do cold war thrillers very well ( remember firefox ) . while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they do n't cover up the fact that it was a good book that does n't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down
1	i have loved this movie since i was a kid . it is lightyears better than the hornblower series that was on a i have read forester 's hornblower series at least 10 times and never get tired of returning to them . gregory peck is not quite the hornblower that i have come to know over the years , but he does a great job . thank goodness this movie is out in dvd . my vhs version is on its last legs
1	this movie is great . i remember watching it when i was really young . im 21 now and still love it . yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great . its not suppose to be realistic . its fiction ! i just realized too that the daughter is the girl from american pie which makes it even funnier . overall this movie is pretty good . if you dont care for the story , atleast get it to see kim and the other chicks in the movie . if you 've never seen the movie , just buy it . its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it . for all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues !
0	what i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its monty python ! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind . if you are new to monty python i would get the quest for the holy grail before this one . also the monty python 's flying circus is great too . it comes in a 16 dvd set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff . i really did not enjoy certain parts . but there is a few good moments .
1	another stop-motion animagic hit from the holiday entertainers , of rankin/bass studios , the kings of holiday tv specials . this 1 hour show was released for the first time on april 6 , 1977 on abc television network . the storyline is very similar to `` santa claus is coming to town '' , from the same studio - and by that i meant that part of the story explains all the traditions of easter and how they began , such as why we eat chocolate bunnies , or why we color eggs . the show opens with a newsreel showing kids asking these questions . fred astaire reprises his role as the singing mailman s.d . kluger and gives a great voice performance but he has a bigger role this time . he has traded in his snowmobile mail truck for `` the little engine that could '' , voiced by robert mcfadden . in the story we go back in time to the beginning of the children 's easter traditions to answer these questions , to a hidden town called `` kidville '' . there is a scary bear named gadzooks who hates holidays , and he is similar to the winter warlock character . a rabbit named `` sunny '' grows up to be the easter bunny and bring joy to children , making great friends and allies along the way . he is voiced by skip hinnant , who voiced `` pogo '' in a special from another studio . he befriends a lonely young king , named bruce , who is being controlled and bullied by his tyrannical aunt longtooth . we have come to expect good music in these holiday specials and they did not disappoint . there are 6 songs total with music by maury laws and lyrics by jules bass including the catchy , `` someone 's got to be first '' , along with `` big rock candy mountain '' , the inspiring `` somebody will love you , if you do '' , and `` the easter bunny is coming to town today '' . fred astaire sings `` all you have to do is - think can do '' . there is a hilarious song by the hendrew sisters , `` what came first , the chicken or the egg ? '' . this very colorful special has terrific character designs by paul coker , who did the same for most of the studios products . the look of the film is , well , very easter ... they just did a great job capturing what the visuals should be for the kids . this show is the 3rd and last of the easter themed holiday shows made by the studio . in 1971 they made an hour long animagic tv special for abc , `` here comes peter cottontail '' , about the selection contest for the easter bunny , and it actually travels through time to all the holidays . in 1976 they made a half hour traditional cel animation special `` the first easter rabbit '' for nbc . as you know , rankin/bass studios brought us such beautiful holiday tv classics such as rudolph the red-nosed reindeer , year without a santa claus , `twas the night before christmas , nestor the long eared donkey , the little drummer boy , frosty the snowman , santa claus is comin ' to town , mouse on the mayflower , cricket on the hearth , the stingiest man in town , rudolph 's shiny new year , and more . they also made non-holiday films such as the hobbit , and flight of dragons . it is incredible that one company was responsible for all those tv specials , 95 % of the ones we see every year . their work includes traditional hand drawn cel animation , stop-motion animagic , and live action . little golden books publishing owns the rights to almost every show the studio made , and have done a commendable job re-mastering them and releasing them on dvd . i hope this comes out on a restored dvd too ; i have bought all the other rankin/bass that has been released on dvd .
0	i was not into this movie at all . my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through . a middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life , so he takes a dance class . ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor , a crush is pursued , a wife gets jealous , hires a detective , and *gasp* his crush is found out . the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me . not a bad movie , just not my cup of tea . richard gere was cute as usual , which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end , besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since `` so you think you can dance '' never had contestants who mastered it
1	wow , let me start off by telling you that i had this video personally when i was younger . i would ask for it constantly , and can still remember having it and watching it everyday . it really helped me learn and the drawings are great ! somewhere in the process of 'growing up , ' the video was lost and i 'm still upset about it . i 'm not ready to have kids myself , but i know that when i do , i definitely want to re-purchase this video ! it 's so great to have things like this to help your children start learning at a young age and i recommend it to everyone . :
0	i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie . it is merely a monument to hollywood 's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale . in dumas 's book the count learns that he can not play god -- dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good -- because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life . he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god . hollywood gives us instead : triumphant revenge .
1	here 's an `` epic '' movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as dr. zhivago and lawrence of arabia . interesting to note that omar sharif was in this modern-day movie and dr. zhivago . several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because , thanks to the previews , they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as `` the mummy . '' well , it was n't and it was way too slow for them . frankly , i thought the `` slow '' parts were the best and overall , thought the film had just the right amount of action , instead of overdoing it as the recent mummy pictures did . another big plus was the cinematography . this is a beautifully filmed movie , stunning in some parts . another good point is the language : hardly a swear word . on the negative side , there was the usual political correctness , a la dances with wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at wounded knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys . the horse race had some credibility problems , too , as `` hidalgo '' came back from the dead not once but twice to race like secretariat ! anyway , if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems , this film is for you and the rest of the family
1	i showed this to my 6th grade english class , while we were reading miracle worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture . they loved it , and really learned a lot about cochlear implants . i highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest
1	i 've enjoyed the black humor of the various texas chainsaw movies , but the gas was running out when this one was made . still there are some fairly funny moments and in-jokes . matt 's performance is a definite highlight . it 's worth a look
1	this movie is among the top 10 of my favourite movies of all time ! it not only honours the life and achievments of the great christian man alvin york , it honours many truths of the christian faith , god 's power to to transform sinners , the virtue of forgiving your enemies , putting god before man , the virtue of earning an honest livelihood . though it does all this , it is not a `` preachy '' movie , it simply tells the amazing story of a simple farmer who becomes the greatest hero of ww1 . other movies in my top 10 include : it 's a wonderful life , forrest gump , shawshank redemption , to end all wars , les misérables .
1	john waters who likes to be called the `` pope of trash '' has done a lot of films that are outrageous in style such as `` cecil b. demented , '' `` pecker , '' `` hairspray . '' `` cry baby '' is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy , but works nevertheless . johnny depp , now a big box office draw and critical success with oscar nominations for `` finding neverland '' `` pirates of the caribbean : the curse of the black pearl , '' can be proud of the rockabilly elvis-type singer he plays named wade `` cry baby '' walker . depp performs his `` jailhouse rock '' type number with great energy and rebellion . having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl 's hearts aflutter . the female lead is allison played by amy locane who worked in other films like `` airhead , '' `` the mummy '' `` bongwater . '' she does a good olivia newton john-like `` grease '' character of the square girl who has a crush on depp 's bad boy . stephen e. miller who was recently seen in `` rv '' with robin williams and previously in `` the accused '' with jody foster does a good job as the square boyfriend baldwin who loses his girl to cry baby . the supporting cast also frolics and froths with ricki lake as sister pepper who is intensely pregnant . iggy pop plays the daddy belevedere and takes a scrub bath in a tub sudsing up favorite parts of his anatomy with gusto . traci lords who was an adult film star plays wanda to the hilt . the deleted scene where she sits in an oversized champagne glass while other hotties romp nearby is way over the top . kim mcguire plays the character hatchet face with a permanent mug . susan tyrell who actually was nominated for an oscar in 1972 for `` fat city '' plays the biker matriarch ramona . she recently appeared with bob dylan in the film `` masked anonymous . '' polly bergen does a nice job as mrs. vernon williams , allison 's grandmother , who emphasizes propriety but encourages her granddaughter to follow her heart . patricia hearst ( the same i think ) who also worked with waters on `` pecker '' `` cecil b. demented '' does a nice job as the naive mother who uses the `` f '' word in the courtroom . `` cry baby '' is meant for pure entertainment ; and that it does ! enjoy
1	friday foster may not be foxy brown , but it 's well worth your time if you 're into this genre . it does have a catchy little theme song ! it does n't have alot of the action and violence of other grier films , it 's more about unravelling a conspiracy . jim backus is given high billing , but only appears in one scene . carl weathers is at the bottom of the billing , but appears in most of the film-but that 's a good thing , coz who does n't like carl weathers ? yaphet koto , as usual , is a joy , and actually gets a few laughs . for those like myself who occasionally fantasize coming home from work to find a naked pam grier in the kitchen making goulash , will enjoy the two topless scenes . foster sure has no problem jumping into the sack with people in this one . basically all i can say about friday foster is that it 's a sure bet if you dig pam grier and/or blaxploitation movies . i know i dig
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last . i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare . there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless . the machines keep freezing up . the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet
0	the young actor is great in this movie , but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring . **
1	i bought this because i remembered loving it when i was a kid in the 70s . now , my daughter is watching it all the time . the basic theme is timeless even if our daughters already know they can be doctors . it 's fun and socially educational .
1	oh god , as a graduate of uag i should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but i ca n't lie . the madera 's own the med . school.. the leano 's own the med . school . the dean does not care about students ... . dean villalobos and martinez sandoval dont care about the students . the infrastructure is a bit outdated ... . you guessed it ! ! uag 's buildings are as old as fenway without any upgrades . oh yeah , the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous pmc program : `` programa medicina en comunidad '' , just like in the film ! ! ! ! it is a riot ! if you plan to go to uag you must watch this film . if you get a hold of it , bring it down to guadalajara so you can laugh .
0	i did n't enjoy the film . i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare . king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays . i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done , and to add nothing of value to the original . you can set it wherever you like , in medieval japan or on the moon , what 's the difference . it 's king lear , a downer of a play , there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear , and it takes up three hours of your time . a moron named lear , or hidetoro , or whatever his name is , relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son . the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father . he is right , of course , and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily . he 's wanted dead or dead . in this treatment of the annoying plot , he loses his mind . he has a faithful follower or two . they overact . there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play . lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk . am i supposed to care what happens to him ? why ? because he used to be a powerful king , and a cruel one ? you may as well cry over saddam hussein . look at this movie with fresh eyes . look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes . this stuff simply is not very entertaining , and is not very good . the hell with king lear . he 's an annoyance
1	firefly is a fantastic series . my wife and i watched the dvd set from and found ourselves rationing the episodes towards the end , because we did n't want the series to be over . great cast , great plots , great music . i really ca n't say enough about this series . i have never enjoyed a season of any show more than i enjoyed firefly , and everyone i 've introduced to it has loved it as well
1	i really enjoyed this movie . at first i thought that her two husbands were vadinho the gambler and drunk , and vadinho the loving husband . he was bascially two different people himself . i would have left him if i was her , though but i understand that in that time women did n't leave their husbands . also in that time , it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses . after vadinho 's death , i was happy that doña flor decided to remarry , but i thought that she could 've found someone more interesting than teodoro . he 's a nice guy and all , but he 's just so boring . she was used to the wildlife with vadinho , and it was a shock to her when she married teodoro . i think that 's why she gave into vadinho when his soul returned . and since she was the only one who could see him , there was no harm in having realtions with him once again , and in the future . she was happy with both of them . she was getting the best of both worlds . i highly recommend this movie to all movie goers
1	great film . steve martin , goldie hawn and dana delany are fantastic in this enjoyable , fun moview . both steve and goldie are hard for any others to match . they easily switch from comedians to serious . a film you 'll enjoy watching repeatedly
1	be sure to catch the alternate views on disk 2 . the view from the control booth with the director losing his mind , in a good way , is great . they also have a beautiful day from the rooftop in boston
0	the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella - too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though . nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger . i have never understood ackroyd 's characters . and keeping in form , he is once again as unfunny as mud . basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film , but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film . ok so she munches on batteries , and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime . she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts . jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script . however , his contribution seems way overstated to me . he does n't have much to do . funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people . basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do . think , jar-jar blinks . i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning . but that 's it . flat and mechanical
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
0	overacted . boring . horrible movie . the only likable character was cat .
1	this is a classic christmas movie that you and your entire family are sure to love . check this out ... i promise you that you will not be disappointed
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it . the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk.the main character totally lost it , believing all what her husband was saying about her . she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all . it 's got an excellent story line , great characters and awesome animation . i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now , not just considering the cartoons either . it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers ( like me ) and adults alike . highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now . i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach . here we have a woman like nora ephron , a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries , she turns into a needy , desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies , one after another . i ususally love all of meryl 's movies , but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy , always pregnant `` homemaker '' . if i were a man , i would have run awary screaming , too
0	off-hand , i ca n't think of a worse movie . ( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films -- hey , he 's making a buck , here . ) that 's all . 1/32 star , if possible
0	i bought this dvd for my daughter who is from china and though i think xiao foo is adorable , i am disappointed by big bird 's behavior . not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way , but he tells barkley at one point to `` sic '' the monkey king and then later , again frustrated , tells the monkey king to put his dukes up ( as if to fight to resolve the issue ) . i am appalled by this . big bird is also somewhat demeaning to the chinese people he encounters -- they do n't understand him because he is speaking english and rather than explain the language barrier , he just gets upset . i love sesame street , and although i will keep this dvd to hear xiao foo sing in chapter 7 ( our daughter just loves her ) , i feel i will need to use big bird 's behavior as an example of how not to act
0	i have friends who might be into this stuff , if only because they like the old and the strange . me , i 'm just like -- is this `` it 's a wonderful life '' ? i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script . as it is , this just barely seems to translate into a movie , and -- forgive me for i have my own opinion -- '' city of angels '' was a good movie . too bad if you do n't like all this `` contemporary nonsense . '' i feel like it worked . my opinion : it 's long , it 's boring , it 's hard to hear . even if it has a message , i just ca n't relate to it . so maybe that 's my problem . your opinion : your own . keep it . you 're lucky i gave it two stars
1	we all love george lucas for creating the star wars universe and introducing us to some of the best characters in movie history but lets face reality here , the man can not write dialogue to save his life . in the ot it was n't as noticeable because the plot was not very complicated and the scenes were very straightforward , the foundation was already there . the pt has to lay that foundation which george lucas fails at . so ignoring the wooden dialouge which produced stilted acting , it is a great movie nonetheless . the plot gives the audience an idea how the empire was created in the first place and gives you a glimpse into the dark side of anakin and sets the audience up very nicely from his ultimate turn from the good side . also for a hopeless romantic such as myself i get to watch a couple fall in love when they 're not supposed to and not let rules and regulations stand in their way . yes , romance is where gl fails miserably but its the story that counts . overall , in this movie as in tpm , there is a lot story and symbolism here which makes it stand out . so my advice is to see the movie , and pay more attention to the story being told . if nothing else , you 'll get to hear some really beautiful music , see some cool special effects and see some cool costumes that you wish you had
0	the personality of a nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance . fred leuchter was painted as such by many people , some who knew him ( and i 'm guessing knew better ) and as we may be witnessing others who did n't . brownshirts insult , assault , rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas . maybe a major lesson of the holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to . so long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas . there must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist , so that they may prove their allegiance to the group . maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent , as dissent does not equal disloyalty ... except in a nazi state . there was a great free press in germany in nazi times , so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries . `` mr. death '' is not representation of fred leuchter . fred leuchter is representation of fred leuchter . might i suggest not suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary . that 's not clarification , that 's reinforcement of one idea . rather go and find fred and speak to him . get his view . if you do n't have a preformed agenda ( like van pelt or morris ) , you may get him to respond like i did . i found a different fred ( and a much much different story ) than i was given by director morris and others . the question is not whether german gas chambers were used to murder people , the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that , or any other idea . that is , without having his house firebombed , a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place , have his reputation ruined , or any of the other stuff happen . if fred 's ordeal is any indication , the brownshirts are alive and well , but i do n't think fred is one of them . the one fact i would alter in my previous post is rabbi bauer 's support for `` no gas chambers '' . bauer supported fred 's methods , not necessarily his conclusion . i tried in vain to contact bauer , on where he differs with fred . fred has high regard for rabbi bauer . the polish forensic investigation ( which came soon after fred 's ! ) did not come to the same conclusion as fred , but did essentially duplicate fred 's data collection methods and results . there was testimony at the nuremburg trials by both inmates and german staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in germany . in 1960 , physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there . it took 16 years ( 1976 ) for simon weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those german concentration camps . a former inmate at auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there . but all this is n't to say that the auschwitz gassings did n't occur , but rather to simply say that some may think they did n't occur and for that they should n't be condemned ... unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like fred
1	nominated for best actor ( massimo troisi ) , best adapted screenplay , best music , best director , and best picture , `` il postino '' is a tender tale of love and poetry on a small island in the mediterranean sea , inspired by an incident in the life of pablo neruda , the chilean poet who was briefly exiled , in 1952 , for his communist ideas which have often got him into trouble ... 'il postino ' is a beautiful , heartbreaking movie , funny in its simplicity and honest dialog ... massimo troisi leaves his final legacy in the role of a shy , hesitant and uncultured postman who possesses the heart of a poet with truly peculiar observations , such as 'the whole world is the metaphor for something else , ' often without realizing how exciting his comments are ... director michael radford had the care to create a wonderful film which floats on the love of words , rhythm , and imagery ... his movie is much heightened by a music score that includes quotes , paraphrases and argentinean tangos ... his film turns out to be a great little movie ... it deals with a friendship between a lethargic villager , who takes the modest job of delivering letters to the celebrated poet living in a secluded area ... poetry becomes their connection ... mario ruoppolo is a simple man with a complicated set of values who rides his bicycle climbing the hard road to neruda 's cozy home and with his timid manners delivers the armful of correspondence to the single customer of the island ... a polite neruda shows little interest in his personal postman , but he favors him , one day , with his autograph , signing one of his books with the words 'regards , pablo neruda . ' nevertheless as time passes the 'poet of love ' becomes a bit more friendly , intrigued by mario 's enthusiasm regarding his poetry and poetic manner of speaking ... mario , impressed that almost every letter delivered to neruda is from a female , could n't understand how his new resident , despite his advancing age , has such magical power over women ... so he tries , with his simple way of thinking , to understand all the secrets of the exalted poet , sharing his thoughts with him ... he becomes increasingly curious , asking a lot of questions about the mystical creation of poetry , forcing the fascinating celebrity to reveal some of the unexposed materials of his artistic vision ... neruda introduces mario to the verbal rupture of metaphors , attempting to teach them to his anxious pupil ... the two men discover an unexpected friendship based on their mutual view that life should be a framework for seduction and romance ... as the film goes on , mario , crafted with a tender spirit , attempts , through pablo , a gentle intervention and poetry to win over the woman he has fallen for , beatrice russo - played by sicilian fashion model maria grazia cucinotta ... becoming in a slow way his 'latin cyrano de bergerac , ' neruda guides his postman into romance , but refuses to write a poem that could charm his young passionate beatrice ... to attract the prettiest girl in town , mario becomes a bit of a poet himself ... but when he finds his own words insufficient to his romantic mission , he appropriates one of his tutor 's sensuous poems , and protests , when discovered , that `` poetry does n't belong to those who write it , but to those who need it . '' unbelievably his 'lyrical words ' fascinate the sensual bombshell who was playing a mean game of table soccer in a low cut dress , but disturb greatly her disapproving aunt donna rosa , who sees that mario is contaminating her niece with his nice words ... nevertheless the postman wins the beautiful beatrice and convinces her to marry him ... heartbreak comes when neruda receives a telegram that he can return to the country he loves so much ... from here on , an extended epilogue with smiles , tears and regret , takes the story on ... and the film almost breathes lyrical tenderness in its depiction of an honest man who longs so much for love ... mario , who has not received any word or greeting from the poet and had remarked that it 's quite normal for the poet not to remember him , returns to the poet 's villa to revisit the place that had once been alive with the sounds and sights of emotional discovery ... in the silence that now surrounds it , he realizes that the poet has taken all the beautiful things away with him ... he gets the idea to create a 'live ' poem for his dearest friend don pablo ... an outdoors tape to let him listen to the wonderful sounds of the island , from the small and big waves at the cala di sotto , to the wind on the cliffs , to the wind through the bushes , to the sad nets belonging to his father , to the church bell of our lady of sorrow , to the starry sky over the island , to pablito 's heartbeat ... philippe noiret ( best remembered for 'cinema paradiso ' ) charms us once again as the affectionate mentor to mario ... he convinces the postman that poets are quite human but warns mario about the old dictaphone saying , 'even the most sublime ideas sound ridiculous if heard too often . ' the sets and the cinematography , accompanied by an oscar winning score , create a wonderful atmosphere of the remote poor island with no running water , of the modest houses with pealing plaster , of the rocky cliffs overlooking the blue mediterranean , of the post-war fishing village under the shades of rose and salmon ... like love itself , some great movies seem surprisingly human ... delbert mann 's 'marty ' was one , cameron crowe 's 'say anything ... ' was another , and now michael radford 's `` il postino '' is exceptional ... his film stands tall in its own right as a 'must see ' movie ... it 's tough to imagine anyone not liking it ... it simply revives our memories , and breaks our heart ...
1	i have watched this movie again and again , and i ca n't imagine a better carmen than rita hayworth ! her carmen is a free spirit , proud , sensual , intelligent , and yet vulnerable too . glenn ford may have been slightly miscast as don jose , but he and rita had such a chemistry that they make this film work . what really sets this film apart , though , is rita 's fantastic dancing ! she was raised in the tradition of spanish dancing from the time she was about 4 years old -- she came from a famous family of renowned spanish dancers -- and it 's such a pleasure to watch her do what must have come so naturally to her . no other dancer can match her for her sheer gracefulness and passion . i 've only seen the dvd version of this movie , so that 's the version i 'm recommending . the colors are luscious and the photography is clear and crisp . and the musical score is very moving . this film may very well become one of your favorites , especially if you 're a rita hayworth fan
1	this series has just a tad too much blood for my taste ... it verges on horror , here and there , which bugs me ; i even like super-violent action movies just fine , but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing ( more 'personalized ' violence than killing bad guys ) is not my style . this is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars . aside from that detail , i find this show totally addictive . the brothers make a 'buddy movie ' effect , and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect ( the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show ; i have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts , and that is central ) . not to mention the young men being so passionate , powerful , strong , yet sensitive , darkly troubled from the past , sheer sexy it 's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes . ; - ) anyway -- the show has an actual plot , it 's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching . i recommend it
0	this is the first time i delved into the hellraiser series , and i have to admit , i kind of regret it . the film opens with a collage of disturbing images , i guess to get my attention , but there is no real reason for them to be there . from there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next . it all looks perfectly twisted , but who really cares . clive barker , as he did in `` night breed , '' shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs . of course they are all very self-indulgent , but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way . had this film showed up at a modern art museum i would have labeled it pretentious . but since it showed up in movie theaters i have no choice but to label it crap . i would love to describe the plot to you , but it did n't make a ton of sense to me . kirsty ( ashley laurence ) is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell , and thus she must go save him . meanwhile her evil step-mom ( and speaking from experience they are all evil ) is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin . upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer . i 'm sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching , but to me it was silly and unnecessary . she goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch , and from there a battle ensues between kirsty and her step-mom over the soul of a little girl named tiffany ( or so everybody calls her ) . the whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells , and that is an idea i can get on board with . one overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an m.c . escher print . with dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis . but i can not get on board with this film . it is sensational for the sake of sensationalism , which is fine with me , but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot . what do i , or anybody for that matter , get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife ? i guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies , but this one does not earn its gore . for those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film . for the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree . i still have `` hellraiser '' on my shelf to watch and i must say it wo n't be hard for that one to top this mess . i may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie . it is the major flaw of this film and japanese horror in general , but i want a story to go with my scares . what this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff . . .or both . i hated this movie , and no i do n't care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces . *1/2
0	what a shame this dvd transfer is so aweful , because the movie is great . i have seen this movie before on sbs tv ( australia ) and have been wanting a copy since . but this dvd looks like a transfer from an already poor quality vhs copy . very disappointed
1	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker/storyteller . dark , moody , exciting ( and fast ! ) , thx-1138 is an amazing example of style and substance . so whatever you do , do n't buy this dvd ! instead , spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film , the early days of lucas and coppola , walter murch 's involvement , and the whole story about american zoetrope . it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved . all in all , it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars . ( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover .
0	rodney dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon ( church of jesus christ ) but this movie did n't get any fact right . the church is never mentioned by name for a reason . polygamy . look like amish . a collection plate ? this movie stinks and i 'm very offended
1	is there anyone out there ( women included ) who did n't develop a crush on the interminably cute lori loughlin after watching the 1985 film the new kids ? probably , but for me , it was different ( yeah , that 's what they all say ) ... lori loughlin looked so very much like a girl in my neighborhood , whom i also had a crush on , back when i was in my teenage years ... seems to me crushes were a dime a dozen back then , as were broken hearts , but i digress ( as usual ) . co-written by stephen gyllenhaal ( father of actors maggie and jake ) and brian taggert ( visiting hours , wanted : dead or alive ) , and directed by sean s. cunningham ( friday the 13th , deepstar six ) , the film features shannon presby ( `` five mile creek '' ) , lori loughlin ( amityville 3-d , secret admirer ) , and james spader ( pretty in pink , less than zero , stargate ) . also appearing is eric stoltz ( the wild life , mask , the fly ii ) , eddie jones ( c.h.u.d. , invasion u.s.a. ) , john philbin ( the return of the living dead , point break ) , vince grant ( timequest ) , paige lyn price ( all the right moves ) , and tom atkins ( halloween iii : season of the witch , creepshow ) . loren ( presby ) and abby ( loughlin ) mcwilliams are teenaged siblings who face a difficult task of moving on after the untimely deaths of their parents . shortly after their parents are laid to rest , uncle charlie ( jones ) shows up and offers to take the pair in , to which loren and abby accept and move to a jerkwater town in florida . on arriving they discover uncle charlie has just purchased a dilapidated amusement park called santa 's funland , to which he plans on fixing up and making his fortune . as kids begin to settle into their new lives , abby finds some of the local boys have taken a shine to her , particularly that of dutra ( spader ) , the creepy , wild eyed , albino leader of loose knit gang of rednecks whose hobbies include dogfights , shooting guns , using and selling drugs , and betting on who can nail the new girl ... smooth move dutra makes his play , but abby , sensing what an obvious sleaze ball the guy really is , turns him down . well , dutra does n't accept rejection well , and he and his boys participate in a little vengeful vandalism and property damage . loren fights back , pretty effectively too , but dutra is n't the type to let things go being all insane and such , and matters escalate to the point where dutra and his cronies kidnap abby during the big dance for a little after party get together ... abby manages to escape ( with a few well placed groin kicks ) , but dutra knows where she 's going , and heads her off at the pass ( the `pass ' being the amusement park ) . soon enough loren makes the scene and now the siblings find themselves running for their lives through the theme park , hunted by liquored up , drug-addled hillbillies sporting shotguns , vicious tempers , and murderous intent . i enjoyed this movie specifically for the fact it did n't try to be more than it was , which is a really well done , exploitive b film . yeah , i suppose having lori loughlin in it did n't hurt its chances with me , but since ms. loughlin refuses to return my calls or participate personally in my romantic visions of whimsy ( have i somehow overestimated my animal magnetism ? ) , any bias leanings i would have normally felt towards the film , or any of the projects she appears in , have leveled off since ... the real highlight here , for me at least , is james spader as eddie dutra , king sleaze in a group where that 's one hell of an accomplishment . picture his character from pretty in pink , only with less money and a whole lot meaner ... and ruthless ... and violent ... and with an odd southern drawl ... and an albino . love that custom maroon boogie van he drives around in ... it 's always interesting to see someone still perpetrating a fad that long since seen its day , even in 1985 ( `vanners ' saw their heyday in the late 70s , despite the protest of a few of the more dedicated members ) . he was just so slimy , so vile , so despicable , and so entertaining . look for the scene when loren sneaks into dutra 's room in the middle of the night to collect on a debt . the décor of dutra 's room speaks volumes towards his character , a great example of fleshing out a character without wasting a lot of screen time . there were some interesting characters in his little band of hoodlum rejects , but dutra was , without a doubt , calling the shots . another aspect i liked was the fact that the characters of loren and abby were n't weakling types normally prone to victimization , but strong characters that stood up for themselves , even despite facing greater odds . this was obviously a quality they got from their father ( played by atkins ) , who we saw a bit of near the beginning of the film . the dialog works , as does the acting ( for the most part ) , and the location shots are excellent . cunningham keeps the story moving along well , priming the audience for what they know is coming , in that of a final showdown , and what a confrontation it is ... what makes the film so much fun , especially towards the end , is that the villains are so absolutely and completely rotten that when they do get their comeuppance , you ca n't help but let out a fulfilled cheer , much like i do when chuck bronson blasts a cap into a worthless punk in one of those death wish movies . a couple of memorable sequences is when loren rigs the ferris wheel and takes moonie for a ride ( dutra had planted moonie on top of the ferris wheel with a rifle ) , and when loren is fighting with gideon ( philbin ) near the roller coaster ... this scene gave new meaning to the phrase `a little off the top ' ... you have to see the film to understand the full extent of that comment . and watch abby get jiggy with a two by four ... few things can get your point across like a good piece of lumber upside someone 's head . all in all this is a great little film , worth at least a rental if you enjoy the seedy side of cinema , and do n't mind a little blood along with perceived violence towards animals ( i do think the lopping of the chicken head was real ) , followed by a slightly predictable ending which i did n't see coming , but enjoyed nonetheless . the quality of the picture , presented in anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) , looks excellent , and the dolby digital stereo comes through very well . there are n't really any special features , but there are some unrelated trailers for other columbia tristar home video releases like frankenfish ( 2004 ) , devour ( 2005 ) , vampires : the turning ( 2005 ) , and kingdom hospital ( 2004 ) . cookieman108 if i learned anything from this film it 's that dousing a woman with lighter fluid and then threatening to set her on fire does not make her more accepting towards intimate relations ...
0	chuck jones continues to entertain new audiences with the road runner and wile e. coyote . chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo . i found it to be very exciting . if you have road runner vs. wile e. coyote the classic chase from warner bros. golden jubiliee 24 karat collection , this video might not be for you . the other five cartoons actually appear on that video ; zip n ' snort , operation : rabbit , hook , line and stinker , beep beep , and ready , woolen and able . otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages
1	when i first saw this film , some five years ago , it truly knocked the breath out of me . for the first time , director allison anders gives us a glimpse into mexican-american gang life in east la 's echo park , from the female perspective , this time . in the past , we have seen our share of male experiences ( example being zoot suit , written by the playwright luis valdez ) . for once , we see the gritty side of the gang life , as young mexicanas ( or chicanas , depending on who you ask ) struggle to stay alive , amidst rampant drug dealing , the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them . mi vida loca is actually a trilogy of stories . ( mousie sad girl , lowrider and la blue eyes ) the first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members , mousie ( seidy lopez ) and sad girl ( angel aviles ) . these young women are best friends , until the day that sad girl sleeps with mousie 's boyfriend , ernesto ( jacob vargas ) , and becomes pregnant with his child . the world they knew before is ruptured , as is their lifelong connection as friends . the second story takes a glimpse in lowrider culture . this culture is perpetuated by , predominantly , young chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing and airbrushing `` low rider '' cars ( many , old school chevies ) , complete with flashy airbrush images ( example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations ) , trick tires and rims . this story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism , when the car takes on a life of its own . the third story is centered around la blue eyes , a beautiful brown-eyed woman who is writing to a convict , that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters . the question is , when they finally meet , will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter , or has the young woman ultimately been deceived , the whole time ? i reccomend this film , if not for the fact that it is compelling , but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about . a very important study in gang life , and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news , but never get to know
1	this episode is a bit different than the others i have seen , although i have not yet seen all of season 2 yet . without giving anything away , this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings . additionally , it has some inventive guest characters . finally , it presents some moral and ethical questions
1	fred astaire met ginger rogers on the set of a previous film , flying down to rio , where they were paired somewhat arbitrarily in one of those momentous decisions that , or so it seems from today 's perspective , made the studio system seem to make sense . you could n't have really predicted the two would click on camera , for fred 's previous partner had been his own sister , and the two of them ( fred and adele ) had concentrated on the slightly nutty , zany dances together that did not require any sexual tension between partners . ( think of the `` triplets '' number in the band wagon . ) as for ginger , nothing in her previous screen or stage work hinted at any softness or vulnerability -- she was , of course , hilarious at playing the sort of hard-edged blonde tramp parts that were too vulgar for jean harlow to play . so matching them up was a gamble , but it sure did pay off , even if flying down to rio gave them little room to show their stuff in . one number , the incandescent `` night and day , changed the way people felt about them almost instantly , and even the never-ending continental , the longest and most tedious dance craze ever captured on film , could not douse the promethean spark they created . hopefully sometime soon whoever owns the rko catalogue will issue this gem -- and its successors -- on dvd . if even finian 's rainbow has come out on a great looking dvd presentation , why ca n't the gay divorcee
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office . confucius overcame many difficulties
1	this is a great `` feel good '' movie , but hollywood altered the story for theatricality . in the film , a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up , in one year , to become calculus winners . there is a good backgroud article at : http : //reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml that describes how the process took ten years , so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the ap calculus exam . jaime escalante ( played by edward james olmos of `` miami vice '' fame ) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time , reaching back to the junior high school that fed garfield high . the way that the movie was done , however , allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them , especially their parents . remarkably , at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under escalante 's leadership . that 's 400 fewer future employees for kfc and macdonald 's . ( as escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student , `` so tough guys do n't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living ? '' ) eventually , it appears that the education establishment won out , driving the brilliant teacher out , and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future . the idea is great , that no student should be regarded as hopeless , and that all should be encouraged to try , but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows .
1	this is a beautiful movie , but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into . it is not a traditional love story . it does not have a happy ending . you are taken on an incredible journey , and grow to love these innocent people , who burn with passion -- then you see terrible , undeserved things happen to them . but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting . it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation , among many other thought-provoking things . it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 , and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd . i appeal to fox searchlight , please dvd this soon .
1	as others have noted , arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball `` my man godfrey '' genre . it is an effectively told , outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies . however , without sir john gielgud ( a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood ) , the film 's faults would be much more apparent . he elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection . he is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility . and the title song is a classic .
1	15 minutes is worth the money . it probably will not be the number one dvd in your collection , but you 're sure to go back and watch it from time to time . this film gives an interesting , if not frightening , look at the role mass-media play in our country 's daily life . we do n't think about it , since we are living it ... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced , 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today . at the center of the movie 's plot is a greedy , slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift ' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders , as they are being committed . he has a moral pause , only for a second , before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world . the rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them . all in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money .
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach . here we have a woman like nora ephron , a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries , she turns into a needy , desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies , one after another . i ususally love all of meryl 's movies , but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy , always pregnant `` homemaker '' . if i were a man , i would have run awary screaming , too
0	why should one buy this series ? what about the missing episodes ? are they going to be added later , or this is it ? i can not believe this . would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel ? or a keyboard without the c and r keys ? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..
0	i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they need n't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors , jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing
1	the msde was received by due date in excellent condition
0	two moderately decent-looking white people who apparently are n't very good at sex go at it in this movie . if that 's your thing , why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it ? at least then you wo n't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film . what a crock . they could at least have cast a fine young sista like rosario dawson or gabrielle union to make this movie moan and squeal ! this movie makes sex seem boring
0	when i watched this movie , i have to say , i thought it was pretty pointless . napolean dynamite is , too , but it 's funny . this is n't quite up to dynamite standards , i 'm afraid . it 's not as squeaky clean as good ol ' napolean , either . do n't buy it . if you must see it , rent it
0	this is not one of fred 's better efforts , the dancing is so so and rita hayworth is among his poorest dance partners . lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the astaire/rogers films . in spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching
1	classic duke ! ! one of the best , great cast , opening scene remindes me of his early movie red river
1	most of the movie , the parts that work anyway , is like a visual kei band 's music video , and it 's nice to have that kewl aesthetic without the bad music that usually accompanies it . the movie 's concept is something that could have only come from asia , where filmmakers seem to digest american influences and refashion them into something that seems to miss the whole point of what made the original ideas work . the kooky face/off being a prime example of this insanity . the cop movie setup seems like needless window dressing , anchoring the visually oriented fantasy content in a reality it need n't have any relevence to , but i guess even alice in wonderland , labyrinth , and the nightmare on elm street series used the device of having it be all in a dream . it 's not a story driven movie and to grade it as such would be unfair . it 's a surrealist visual art project , something that barely exists in cinema , and although it would be better placed in the context of some worthwhile characters and plot , it is making progressive and original use of the film medium . it 's much like the corpse bride in that regard , except this film will weird you out with twists of random insanity instead of bore you with tedius monotony and musical numbers . criticisms from one-star reviewers such as `` pure eye candy , no story '' could n't be more accurate , but if you 'd ever go to look at an art exhibit , this film is equally worth a look .
0	i think the newer version `` the love affair '' with warren beatty/annette benning better .
1	nuts was a hit off-broadway play . claudia draper ( barbra streisand ) is a high priced call girl who has killed one of her johns ( leslie nielsen ) . her parents , arthur and rose kirk ( karl malden and maureen stapleton ) , just want to sweep it under the carpet by having her committed to an institution . but she does n't anything to do with her parents or their scheme . her high priced lawyer quits after she attacks him . that gets the attention of public defender aaron levinsky ( richard dreyfuss ) . the arraignment judge ( dakin matthews ) is displeased with levinsky 's wanting to take this to trial and only gives him the weekend to prepare his case for the sanity trial . their relationship begins is a chess match of trust . levinsky gathers the evidence he needs for the trial and the sanity trail begins with trial judge stanley murdoch ( james whitmore ) . the first prosecution witness is dr. morrison ( eli wallach ) who testifies that claudia should be institutionalized . this followed by her mother rose who testifies about her past . and then her stepfather arthur testifies . during the testimony , claudia first draws her stepfather as a vampire then her parents with no mouths . aaron puts the clues together and discovers that arthur was molesting claudia . the defense puts up its only witness , claudia . even under sedation , claudia makes her points . the prosecution recalls dr. morrison and his testimony inflames claudia and she makes an impassioned rebuttal . martin ritt and barbra streisand assembled a flawless cast . the role of claudia was made for streisand . she has a field day with it . maureen stapleton is always a joy to see and she hits all emotional levels with this role . karl malden usually plays the stoic heroic man . this was an underrated performance and should have been garnered more attention . james whitmore had a small pivotal role but showed what featured actor really means . and this is probably richard dreyfuss ' best performance . martin ritt was one of the great directors and he liked nothing more than a controversial film . this was a perfect film for him . streisand did triple duty on this film besides starring , she produce the film and did the musical score . streisand has shown that she has a talent for scoring films . before , she just wrote music for songs . this was a big step for her and it proved that she can do more than the normal performer . if you like high drama , courtroom films or just plain good acting , this is your film . dvd extras : commentary by barbra streisand
1	the first time i saw the film was when i saw it in the sale in virgin mega stores.so i picked it up and put it on straight away a soon as i got home and i was totally amazed with crawfords wonderful performance and also was amazed with hustons performance too.in rain crawford plays a prostertute called sadie tompson , who has ran away form her old life in san francisco.but as soon as she arrives at this hotel at pongo pongo she already gets into trouble as soon as she enters the hotel by this preachers wife .but later she has a run in with the preacher ( huston ) . which is n't good for her . huston hypnotises her with prayers and it makes her want to go to san francisco.but huston in the ends slashes his throat and sadie turns back to normal.its one of the best films crawford has ever made
1	i originally saw this imax movie in hawaii , at the polynesian cultural center 3 years ago ... and bought the soundtrack , always hoping to get the dvd . much to my amazement , the movie was included for my pc as one of the features for windows xp . anyway , the music , narration , and footage is breathtaking , i left the imax theatre feeling physically off-balance because of the motion of the seas and the ocean , and so moved by the magic of it all that i was teary-eyed the rest of the day . i ended up at sunset beach on oahu 's north shore that evening watching the sunset and had the beach to myself . it is one of those days that you will never forget in your lifetime , it is still so vivid , and watching this dvd brings every cell in me back to the living sea and the beaches of hawaii . absolutely moving and breathtaking ... even when watching on the small screen vs. the imax screen . you will not be disappointed
0	a shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values ... a waste of time .
0	i wish that amazon can get it right , that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around , shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen . i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes . it appears to be a much better product and service
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete . very dissapointing . guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show . just leaves you hanging . exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
1	with the death of her infirmed husband , may , an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible , dead from the neck down , and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son , bobby and his shallow wife , helen , and paula , a self- absorbed , clinging , and minimally talented daughter . the central family is anything but warm , supportive , and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband . the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies , the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else . as may comes to realize the world is still important to her , the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter 's boyfriend , a carpenter and rough sort . may embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first , but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him . this is the kind of role hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them , but they would never appear because of the frank and overt sexuality , unglamorous wardrobe , little makeup , and social commentary on the vapidness of the society most film industry women are involved . the performance by the lead actress , anne reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face-lift , hair extensions , and liposuction . she bares more than her soul for the screen . daniel craig is the enabling handyman , derrek who beds both mother and daughter . he turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow 's situation , but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen-house . his aimless character 's inability to say no to the ex-wife , boring girlfriend , and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence . while good with his hands at building a conservatory , he is unable to construct meaning in his life . one of the best films from britain in years , it is simply adult in its storyline . the mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for american audiences to tolerate having no car chase , no bling , no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by tv starlets and buff studmuffins . the mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook , send to the retirement home , and get out of the way . may does n't know what to do as she is made alive by darren , is n't willing to go to the old folks home , and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age
1	`` when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight , it concentrates his mind wonderfully '' - samuel johnson michael keaton gives an effective and heart-felt performance as bob jones , a young , successful pr executive married to a beautiful woman ( nicole kidman ) who is expecting their first child . the bottom falls out of his life when he is diagnosed with a fatal illness , and only given months to live . he is forced to exam his life that he 's really just been rushing through . bob jones not only has never stopped to smell the roses ; he has n't even noticed that they are there at all . 'my life ' is a realistic portrayl of what must go through one 's mind when one is brought up short by such stunning news . although the topic is certainly depressing , it is something we will all one day face . this is how one man deals with the terribly bad hand he has been delt . especially poignant is the fact that not only wo n't he probably be around to help raise his child , but he might not even make it long enough to see his child born . heart-wrenching . in several pivotal scenes , jones decides to hope for a miracle , and visits an asian healer ( haing ngor who starred in 'the killing fields ' ) who tells him that he has too much anger and hurt in him . jones resists the whole notion of exploring how he got to where he is , at least for a while . his anger at his family is one point of anger he must struggle with . keaton does an excellent job here . we see flashes of the actor we saw in 'mr . mom ' and earlier movies , sort of a lovable , good-hearted guy with a funny edge to him . his bob jones evolves slowly and realistically from a man who is stunned and angry , to a man determined to let his child know who he is . ngor also plays the right note as a practioner who ca n't cure his patient , but perhaps can help him in his last journey . a potentially maudlin , down-beat subject is handled with just the right amount of empathy and gentleness and with a light touch . highly recommended . very highly recommended if you 've had such a scare , are living with a terminal illness , or have had a loved one deal with such issues
0	there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman 's classic `` the virgin spring '' and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired , `` last house on the left '' by wes craven . they share identical plots , feature graphic rape scenes , and before it 's all over turn average men into murderers . and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961 's oscar-winning best foreign film -- and the other appreciated only in underground circles , but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation . so just how different are they ? not as different as you might imagine -- but as different as art and exploitation . `` the virgin spring '' is easily one of bergman 's most accessible films . telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion , he exposes a frankness and brutality people were n't accustomed to seeing . a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy . though they initially seem helpful , their actions quickly become violent . after a graphic ( for the time ) rape , the girl is murdered . later , the wrongdoers happen upon the girl 's home and seek shelter from her family -- both groups unaware of who the other is . suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought . it is a powerful tale of love , loss and the depths people can be driven into -- where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code , where savagery and rage take over . bergman 's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father . real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen . add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it 's a winning combination . but what endures in the story of `` the virgin spring '' is how strong a component faith becomes -- when there is nothing left to believe in , can you still believe ? a classic in every sense , `` the virgin spring '' still has the power to shock but there 's something very redemptive about the film . `` last house on the left , '' however , is probably more notorious than acclaimed . the plot , as i 've said , is identical . coming 12 years later , in 1972 , wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale . it is a shocker , and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the `` torture cinema '' of today . it is brutal , uncompromising and graphic -- and the film was championed in the underground horror market . working with a small budget , the film lacks the artistry of `` the virgin spring . '' while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock -- what it lacks is depth and subtlety . the characters are n't particularly drawn out so their actions do n't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film . without contemplating faith and moral choices , what we 're left with is straightforward revenge . and the film , ultimately , has no redemption -- no uplift . it 's violence for the sake of violence . it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it 's own right . and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation . kgharris , 11/06
0	i got this film because i 'm from detroit where this takes place . it 's a pretty typical revenge flick . four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer . usual smartass remarks , guys talking bs , fights , shootouts , blah , blah , blah . i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch . this script was mediocre at best . give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe .
0	to put it succinctly , brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis , which is then swiped by joe pesci , the homeless dude who , predictably , is really quite wise . the problem is that his `` wise '' sayings are n't really too wise ; he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent , but does n't really know that much . joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying . that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character
1	probably the best portrayal of louis l'amour 's sackett series . although more than one book was used , it all ties together . casting was excellent . i would highly recommend this dvd for all l'amour and/or sackett fans
1	many people , when they think of buddhism , think of blissful meditation and serene contemplation . this movie graphically depicts the other side of buddhism ; i.e. , hard work in the real world , in the real transformation of oneself and in one 's efforts to help other beings , no matter how difficult or horrific the circumstances . the film concerns a japanese soldier separated from his unit in burma , at the very end of ww ii and its immediate aftermath . as he journeys to find his unit in a pow camp , he is confronted , at every turn in this wasteland of war , with dead and unburied fellow japanese soldiers . at first , he disguises himself as a buddhist monk ( knowing that the burmese respect and feed their monks ) . when he comes across british hospital staff burying an unknown japanese soldier , with a formal christian burial service and great respect , he is transformed . he recalls the hundreds of dead and unburied japanese soldiers he had seen in his journey , he becomes a true buddhist monk , and makes a singular and difficult vow ; he will not return to japan until he has buried all of the corpses he had seen . so he goes back , and begins his work . hardly blissful meditation , this . but he personifies what the buddha taught ; the purpose of life is to be happy , but true happiness can only come from serving others . this soldier/monk , in devoting his life to active , difficult and gruesome work , is more a true fulfillment of the buddha 's teachings than is one who meditates on the weekend and wears prayer beads because it is `` cool . '' sorry to sermonize , but this movie is not only a wonderful work of cinema , it is a buddhist teaching in itself . compassion must be coupled with the very difficult work of serving others .
0	waste of money . waste of time . well-known cast . amateurish direction . plotless . politically correct to the point of being stupid . the film 's incessant attempts at humor fail . eric roberts ' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film . he is self-important , godless and emotionally false . it 's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character . the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant . the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts ' passionate farewell kiss . most authentic moment in the film : lee grant 's reaction to her dying son being carried off . very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it 's so repetitive and vapid . you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments . if you choose to waste your time with this film , you 'll be sorry you did
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office . confucius overcame many difficulties
1	emotionally shattering true-life tale ( well , sorta ) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he ( played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting ) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis . what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie ( and it is both , and splendid examples of each ) instead resonates as a meditation on survival , betrayal , and accomodating and forgiving oneself . a great film , but only for mature audiences .
1	this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood . the music alone will move you to the kleenex box . if you have lost someone to aids , this movie will touch you deeply . i was told not to watch this movie alone . watch it with someone to hug . how right they were . bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have . eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know . bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect
1	colin firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football ( soccer for americans ) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship , thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for arsenal . his self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend 's interests muck up what could be a good relationship . on the other hand , it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about firth 's character , paul . perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid . she attempts to get involved in his passion but does not quite have the rabid , feverish passion he has . eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship , but she comes to see that she likes his identity , which is strong , linked to football or not . she has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life . of course , one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate , but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him , faults , obsessions and all

1	what else could you expect from the belgian 's ... buy hey , jean-claude , at the premiere of cyborg you let me and my cousin in the rain . you were stuck in brussels ... so , i 'll still owe you a signed poster ; ) this movie is what it 's all about , off course , bruce lee was widely known . but this one is trully magnificent ... the story is based on a true-story , the movements are very very athletic and beautifull ... to make it short ... this movie has it all ! ! ! more from this please instead of such stupid movies were chinese men make 7 flips in once while throwing some stars on top off a bus for example ... this movie let 's you see what it really is ... art ! !
1	i have seen this movie many times while growing up . its definately a different approach to science fiction , but not too bad . basically , you get to see how mortal enemies can work out their differences , and work together . a movie with a message
1	probably one of steve mcqueens greatest movies . only this one can happen
1	this is my favorite spielberg movie . most other directors would live off a film like this for the rest of their lives . for spielberg , this is almost a forgotten movie . wonderful story about a young english boy ( christian bale ) living in china who gets separated from his parents and ends up in japanese prison camp during wwii . filmed in china , it beautifully depicts in full detail a part of wwii that is seldom viewed .

1	this film must be scrutinized in the light of being tony scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment . additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision . sarandon and deneuve are in very good shape and bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances ; after his standout performance in `` the man who fell to earth '' and `` furyo . '' so think about all those factors at the moment you bet for watch it . it 's extremely important . to my mind , this is one of the hottest cult movies of the eighties .
1	tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on hbo during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series . the film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore , nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and was n't even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse billy zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time , william sadler plays brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that brayker has , the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc , the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you 'll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons . all the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this . the film also stars jada pinket smith , cch pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and thomas haden church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that i do n't recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that i highly recomend that you watch
1	a man escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings . bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero 's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator , which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape , but in other respects it 's a perfectly contained and executed movie . the performances are very strong ( bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time ) and the christian allegory - that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it - is not overstrained : although this time round i noticed a few more references to religion than i recalled , it 's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon . new yorker 's source material is not especially good , but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are , it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them
1	comparisons to the 1937 classic are inevitable . story-wise , there is little difference except for the colonization of the remake . many of the frames are carbon copies of each other . this reviewer feels that the b & amp ; w format of the original added to the suspense . the original cast is clearly superior especially the male leads of ronald coleman , david niven and c. aubrey smith . also , douglas fairbanks jr. outshines james mason as rupert of hentzau , the main bad guy . ( i wonder if a stunt man performed that high dive . ) a nice gesture is the cameo role of lewis stone , the star of the 1922 silent version . it is the 1952 female leads who compare most favorably : deborah kerr comes very close to equaling madeleine carroll as the lovely queen flavia , with her strong ( ! ) sense of duty . and jane greer probably surpasses mary astor 's 1937 role . both mary and jane are key to the plot . watch them closely ! blessedly , despite the many frame similarities , the remake does not carbon copy the 1937 fadeout , with ronald coleman 's gallant wave of farewell . on its ' own merits , the 1952 version is a very credible adventure story indeed . it only suffers from comparison to an original classic it can not possibly surpass
1	life imitates art . the main character in this movie may have seemed over the top when it was released . but today , this movie seems almost like a documentary . this is a true horror classic . it 's among the best of this particular genre . do not watch in on a full stomach
1	the lived tragic story during the ww2 in a small town of the occupied czechoslovak . a carpenter is hired `` arian controller `` in a modest and humble bottom store where her owner a jew old lady thinks the best about him , unknowing what ' s really going on backstage . i few words a major film told without melodramatic effects , but told with asserted expression and crude realism . another amazing evidence of the artistic foreseeing three years previous to the invasion .
1	i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this . an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace.com check it out
0	i have seldom seen such a bad movie with so much talent . ( david arquette , stephen baldwin , mickey rourke , etc . ) one wonders what they saw in potential for this script or why they made choices to be involved . this horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank-robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing ( and torture ) to last me for the rest of my life . the film starts out terribly boring and gets more mindless and boring as it concludes , perhaps expecting the violence to make up for the total lack of story . this is a disaster not worth enduring . save the actors and film-makers the embarrassment of seeing this film and see something else .
0	dont dwnld `` survivor , `` thunderstorms sacrifice '' `` . its my fault for not reading the whole thing . you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but no , its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 . i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode . no finale . i got rippped off . $ 1.99 dwnld not well spent . dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending . because they dont have that episode , not even the reunion show
1	i have been using cindy crawfords tapes since 1993 . i used shape your body while i was pregnant 10 years ago ( do n't be horrified ) living in the tropics and with a few adjustments i did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking . i had my first birth naturally and within 3 hours and had the best legs ever . my first impression of cindy was that she is honest . she does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the dvds . i have tried many other celebrity videos and you just do n't feel comfortable with them . she does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time . really she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.you can not help but like her . new dimension is fantastic i have started doing the 10min workout everyday . you do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas . people can workout for an hour and not get the same results . new dimension is not just a post pregnancy dvd . this is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the dvd are more than you will ever need to work all your body . i still mix it up with first two dvds i have just purchased the set of three dvds again to replace worn out copies . cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time . please enjoy ! ! ! ! ! !
0	like most people who made the effort to see this movie , i read tim sandlin 's book and thoroughly enjoyed it . unfortunately for this movie , sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter . the film is disjointed , awkward , and hard to follow . it quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another , allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story . the casting is n't bad -- a prepubescent mischa barton was a fine choice ( a hysterical one for fans of the o.c . ) , and jennifer jason leigh is also respectable , although she does n't fit her character 's physical description -- but that does n't nearly make up for the film 's jumpy direction and half-baked plot . in sum , this is a dissatisfying and substandard film . undoubtedly , the subject matter is better suited for a novel , and sandlin 's humor and talents are better utilized there . read his books . avoid this movie .
1	another great richard scarry video . this video teaches kids in a way that is interesting and fun for them ... without being obnoxious for their parents ! we love it
1	i 've never seen a movie with a more accurate depiction of life in the ussr from late-40s to early-50s . what people had to live with psychologically far outweighed anything physical for the average person . buy this film to understand
1	this movie is absolutely ridiculous ! i 'm a super musical fan and i had a friend who kept telling me that xanadu was a movie you could n't turn away from whenever you caught it on tv . boy was he right ! the music , themes and special effects are totally 80s . i was so pleased to see one of my all time favorites gene kelly as a starring character . olivia newton john 's love interest , michael beck was the guy from warriors , another of my favorites . this is a great movie
0	pleasant movie but nothing special , a very ordinary story . audrey hepburn 's charisma is what puts some life to the movie . some subtle humour though
0	i was a big fan of the st1 . the plot and characters were excellent , it rated up there with the best of them i would give st1 5 stars . i saw this was on sale for a great price so i got it expecting great things . usually sequels are n't to par with the originals so i at least expeted a 3-star movie . when i flipped on the movie i said `` wow ... .right where they left off '' at a pretty good battle seen with the bugs . well , that was it i was waiting for more action . i waited ... .i waited ... i waited and i waited ... they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still was n't worth it . i do n't know who 's idea it was for the sequel but i hope this was their last one . i 'll stick with the new battlestar galactic and star trek reruns
0	i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago . unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying . it 's a cross between the blob , the thing and a really crap detective movie . moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie . this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it . no suspense , few laughs , and way to hokey to watch twice . if you love this movie you need to get out more .
1	i recently viewed this film when it was broadcast on television , and i must say that it was one of the best movies i 've seen in a while . part of the spy genre , quiller travels to berlin to investigate the resurgence of a group of nazis and it is necessary for him to uncover where their base is located . as with any spy thriller , it is difficult at times to differentiate between a supposed friend and and an enemy . one keeps wondering if quiller is indeed placing his trust on the right people , particularly those who claim to be on his side . quiller is a spy who does n't carry a gun , noting that he is less likely to be killed if he is not armed . despite his intelligence and wit , he still gets caught in precarious situations . impeccable acting accompanied by astute dialogue make this a compelling piece to watch over and over again
1	perhaps the only sculpture movie i ever saw . very french . she finally looses her mind at the end . much angst
1	this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting . this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch . the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source . frankly you forget that it is in black and white format
1	this movie is the best b movie i have ever seen . i have seen a lot but this one has it all
1	haha , now , all the other reviews say this movie is cheesey , now , maybe its cause i get scared really easily , but this movie just had something about it that scared the crap out of me ... ..i couldnt even finnish i
0	watching the razor release ( which i bought to save a few dollars ) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated . let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times . fortunately i was able to find the much-praised version released by era of taiwan from a seller here on amazon , and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog-sheer perfection .
0	i 'm a fan of ncis , but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa . why is this only available to those in the usa ?
1	if you like movies as i do , this dvd set should satisfy any film fanatic with over 21 ( that 's right ) extra features -- clearly a prototype of what we film fans want in our dvd sets . to see producer irwin allen in his rolls royce and a pink polyester leisure suit ( complete with white shoes ) discussing the finer points of 'the poseidon adventure '' and `` towering inferno '' as he takes us on a tour through 20th century fox is as informative as it is funny . commentaries by film historian f.x . feeney and sfx director , mike vezina , add another dimension to understanding this interesting film . much has already been written about this film itself by the other amazon critics here , suffice to say the acting in this motion picture ( save for the two little brats in jennifer jones ' charge ) is quite good with newman as the architect and and mcqueen as the fire captain , both excellently cast . then again , when have these actors ever disappointed audiences in their respective roles ? veterans faye dunaway and bill holden rarely disappoint , richard chamberlain is downright creepy , and even fred astaire ( at 80 years of age when this was made ) manages to inject some needed satire here and there as he tries to woo jennifer jones . for those from the sf bay area , the setting for this movie was san francisco and the distinctive lobby of the hyatt regency at embarcadero was used for many of the scenes in the first half of the movie . ok , this is not going to be a long review , and the film does not really impart any substantial revelations about life and death . i could get very deep and argue that the film is a metaphor to man 's vanity and ego dedicated to the capitalistic excesses of power , wealth and greed , but let 's get real -- it 's just one damn exciting movie with excellent special effects ( academy awards for cinematography and editing ) , reasonably good acting all around , and edge-of-your-seat entertainment . i just hope they do n't make another remake a la `` the poseidon adventure '' for this film -- irwin allen 's rendition will do just fine .
1	live from las vegas is fantastic ! ! ! the best show ive ever seen ... realy and i 've been to a few ! ! ! even thought i didnt see her live in las vegas . i saw her in london in the uk , she was still preformed a unbelievable show on dvd and was just like watchin her when i did in london . by the way , britney does sing some songs live , like 'baby one more time ' , 'not a girl not yet a women ' and 'sometimes ' and the reason why she occasionally does not sing live is because she jumps around and dances and would be out of breathe qucikly ... so for that reason she can sing live ! ! ! a realy excellent buy ! ! ! would recommend to any britney fans ! !

1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east ( mainly china 's ) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy . yi soon shin , however , is a rare exception . not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the chosun political factions ( and the second-guessing nature of the king ) which causes his eventual death . also , the special effects are great . the battle scenes ( whether on sea or land ) are realisitic and of outstanding quality . the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china . then again , this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral . also , the entire selection should have 104 episodes . i do n't know why it stops at 101 . if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject , try samuel hawley 's imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources ) . any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion ( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun : total war by creative assembly ( now in gold version ) .

1	this is an important and well presented video tape documentary on the panama canal . it is also about how the united states was instrumental in the following : assisting panama independence from colombia , completing the canal project where the french failed , establishing u.s. geopolitical interests in panama , e.g. , military bases and improving trade relations throughout the world by the panama canal transit waterway
1	i enjoyed this movie . some of the reviewers do n't understand this was not a documentary on the bambino . this was a movie . the fine gentlemen p. b. pereira attempt to dismiss john goodman as a somewhat successful star from the late 80 's is idiotic and off the mark . you sir are taking the whole movie too seriously . babe 's rough and tumble upbringing left its mark on him . goodman is terrific throughout the movie , i really fell for the lovely trini alvarado who plays babe 's first wife , she is stunning . as far as the would have , could ofs and other wild speculation on how good babe would have been , think about this . babe did n't use illegal steroids like today 's ball players , he rode a train not a jet , fitness equipment did not exist . in addition the old ball parks tended to have greater distances from the plate to the fence . i highly recommend this movie , if for just the `` pull my finger '' line
1	as someone well versed in various kinds of literature , someone who has read ( and enjoyed ) almost all of tom clancy 's novels , and as a professional videographer , i have to say , this is a great flick . for those who are upset about the adaptation , what do you expect ? when taking an 800 plus page book and condensing it down to a two hour movie , some things are going to change . the second and third clancy movies- especially clear and present danger - were also adapted to give harrison ford the action spotlight . but now that ford is ageing , paramount ( who after all , is a business needing to turn a profit ) needed to re-invent the franchise . the move to make it not just a new actor , but to show it as the start of jack ryan 's career was cleverly done . most of all , it held true to the idea of the book , that when we base our actions off of our fears and suspicions , our peace can be torn apart by a few depraved individuals . this movie falls into the category of action/thriller . as such , not everything is true to life , but instead is designed for entertainment and suspense . and it delivers . for something in the action category it has a remarkably intelligent script . it 's a little slow in the beginning for those who are looking for nothing more than explosions and shootouts , but it 's worth it . it also has better than average cinematography compared to most action flicks . the effects are well done and not at all cheesy , as many action flicks have taught us to expect . the acting is well-done , with a typically good performance by affleck and a stellar performance by freeman . the soundtrack is also fantastic , especially the rendition of the national anthem at the football game . bottom line , if you 're a reader who expects movies scripts to be written like books , do n't see this movie . if you accept that literature and movies are entirely different formats of entertainment then you 'll probably enjoy this movie , and it is certainly worth ownin
1	in a small , quaint bookshop , in which the paint is peeling from the mismatched bookcases , and the view of the sea below is as crisp and clear as it possibly can be from the wavy , leaded glass windows . now picture coming back to this town every summer , visiting old friends , spending your fourth of july evening at the local park . this movie is more about mood to me than anything . i watch it over and over every summer , wishing i could be a bookseller in loblolly-by-the-sea . i can almost smell the salty air and taste the lobster in the local restaurant . this film is a love letter to the romantic in all of us who wishes to spend time curled up with a good book ( or movie ) on a lazy summer day . capshaw is a perfect helen . degeneres , a perfectly hilarious best friend . and selleck is wonderful in this film , capturing the sensitive george . it makes me wonder why he does n't take on more roles . the only fault i find with this film is in the casting of thomas everett scott ( `` that thing you do '' ) as johnny . he 's a bit too mature-looking to play helen 's impetuous summer fling . no matter how many times i watch this movie , i 'm never thorougly convinced he 's right as the young college student . anyway , enjoy the film , soak up the mood , and i 'll bet you 'll come back again and again .
0	it 's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to hollywood for a new version of `` fahrenehit 451 '' . although i appreciate what truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties , the movie just does not hold up well in 2007 , particularly when shown in a high school classroom . advancements in cgi could transform bradbury 's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller . my students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically . that being said , the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie did n't satisfy their understanding . lose the wires on the jet packs !
1	robin williams is an afrs disc jockey in saigon during the vietnam war . he is fast-talking , zany , unconventional - and a problem for his superiors . williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone , doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can , that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten . the movie is an exhausting experience to watch , as it must have been for williams to perform . it 's an amazing one-man show , but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty

1	so much is unknown about the valid attempts african-americans made to build their own society 's , during the 18th century , forward . this story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in america as free , productive , people . ' my classes sat with eyes glued to the screen . it was a horrific awakening for many of my students . they were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives , that african-americans were a useless species . well , they now know the truth . african-americans were very diligent in building businesses , places of worship , homes , etc. , which frightened the cacausion people of that era , so they were destroyed - and much hope with them .
0	let 's just be honest : this film is terrible . . . and not in the way that `` attack of the killer tomatoes ! '' is so `` terrible '' that it 's great . . . more like the way `` caddyshack ii '' is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame . . . i was a kid when this film was released . and , while it was not particularly exciting then , it is insanely tedious now . it is a genuine test of patience . . . but with no pay-off what-so-ever . here 's some potentially helpful information : the slasher film can branch in two directions : supernatural ( friday the 13th ii , halloween , nightmare on elm street etc ... ) and crime/revenge ( i spit on your grave , friday the 13th , tcm , scream , urban legend ect ... ) . this one falls under the latter heading . and while realism can render a more potent effect ( `` this could really happen ! `` ) , this film simply fails to engage the viewer on any level . the goal of a slasher film is two-fold : to horrify and repulse . this does neither ! ! the `` horror '' element is non-existent : there is no point in expounding , since there is nothing to examine . and , if you love gore ( and who does n't ? ) try another film . the `` murders '' are barely visible ( literally ) and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn . many of the film 's problems are technical : the cinematography is just horrendous . the entirely film is extremely underlit , the colors are needlessly washed-out , and the film stock is grade `` f. '' and this , as you know , is not because the film is over twenty-five years old . . . the problem was always there . there is one `` good '' moment in the entire film . . . when the school 's `` bad boy '' has his head lopped-off and it clumsily thunks down the prom-court walk-way . still , it is more comic-relief than genuine horror . the soundtrack could not be worse . i am not referring to the disco tunes ( we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period ) , but the tracks made for the film . . . they sound like they were squeaked-out by the carpenters . so , imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster , psuedo-thoughtful ballads ( like the final song on the track ) . words can not explain how wildly offensive it is ! ! did i mention that leslie nielson has a meaty role ( yes , that leslie nielsen from airplane , and naked gun ) ? he plays a tough-minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter . i know , it sounds funny , but it 's not ! ! trust me ! ! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers `` disco the night away , '' hey , this film is totally for you ! ! but if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle-period of its reign look elsewhere ( like halloween , friday the 13th etc ... ) i 'd be willing to get all ed mcmahon 's star-search on you and give this `` film '' a 1/4 star . but it is an important milestone in the slasher sub-genre ( i will not spoil the film and tell you why , though ) . so if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar , watch it . . . on picture-in-picture . . . maybe after a few drinks . . . on a day when the cable is out . . . on fast-forward !
0	i seriously did not laugh once in this movie . horatio sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times , but i ca n't believe i think he should have been in the movie more . i thought saturday night live was bad , i had no idea ! snl is gold compared to this . every single joke falls flat and the director obviously has no clue how to make a movie . i ca n't even tell if jerry o'connel and jake busey are bad actors because the director does n't even give them a chance . i think one thing that could have really helped this movie out would have been a script . in case the director reads this review i want to tell him you need to have a script before shooting a film . just a tip . one of the worst movies i have ever seen , easily . 0/
1	... far more complex and feministic than the `` girls and flapper fashions '' , would have you believe . needs to be seen in it 's entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem . the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as `` upstairs downstairs '' . if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good , both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company
1	this is the original version of this film with david niven , peter sellers , woody allen and other very familiar faces . the film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good . but ian fleming intended his 007 to be a non-serious serious agent . excellent film and i heartily recommend it . my 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie ; had to have the dvd after seeing it on tv
1	this film having been produced in 1957 , was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a d.i . at p.i . it showed for two consecutive nights and i think every d.i . on p.i . somehow arranged to see it . we wanted to see if they got it right i guess . i viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic . a most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times . i highly recommend it
0	dario argento 's `` tenebre '' is more of a murder mystery with graphic violence rather than a pure horror movie . this is not a knock on `` tenebre '' , but having purchased this movie because it was characterized as a `` horror movie '' , i was a bit disappointed overall . `` tenebre '' is about an author who wrote a book named `` tenebre '' which provides details of very graphic images of murder and a killer is using these images verbatim to commit his murders . what ensues is a pretty good suspense thriller in the mold of a `` who dunnit '' like murder mystery . the author begins his own investigation of these crimes and the audience is somewhat prepared for an interesting twist of an ending that is more satisfying to the mystery lover rather than horror movie fanatic . clearly , there is very little about `` tenebre '' that can be characterized as `` scary '' or terrifying unless the actual violence horrifies you , but a sophisticated horror movie audience will be relatively unmoved and unimpressed at what `` tenebre '' has to offer in the areas of horror ... sure , there are some incredibly violent and graphic kills , but that alone does not make a good horror movie . fundamentalists may argue that `` tenebre '' does fit the mold of a `` slasher movie '' and while this is technically accurate , i would argue that this movie , as a whole , lacks the `` feel '' of a horror movie and is more of a mystery and suspense flick . indeed , what argento does provide in `` tenebre '' is a very good murder mystery with some `` slasher-movie '' like kills . there is no question that the cinematic atmosphere that is produced by this movie creates great suspense and thrills while very little in the way of `` chills '' . in my mind , `` tenebre '' is definitely much better than `` deep red '' , but the movies are very similar in style except for a stronger plot development which is clearly evident in `` tenebre '' . there is no doubt that argento has always been long on style and short on plot development , but that is immaterial regarding its erroneous classification as a horror movie . that being said , argento 's horror masterpiece `` suspiria '' and even `` inferno '' are clearly much better in the way of producing pure horror than is `` tenebre '' . i mildly recommend `` tenebre '' if you are looking for a good murder mystery movie with some very graphic violence and an intersting twist to the ending , but if you are looking for a good slasher movie or horror flick dealing with similar although not identical subject matter , check out alfred hitchcock 's immortal classic `` psycho '' , which is clearly cinematic horror at its finest .

0	to begin , i am not a big fan of cary grant , except in his hitchcock movies , where he was excellent . and i enjoy him much with katharine hepburn in bringing up baby . he was very good in the eagle and the hawk with fredric march . he was tolerable in the philadelphia story and talk of the town . a friend of mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i had wanted to see what cary would do in this film , and i wanted to see him in the dress . from the start , the movie was slow and boring , all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny . i also do n't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other , and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other . come on ! i just ca n't understand that sort of romance situation . i felt cary showed that `` mean streak '' he can show in some of his films , in the romance situation of this story . i rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end . all the while i kept saying , `` let 's move along , let 's end this thing , when does he put on the dress ? ... '' but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring , corny jokes . and the part we wanted to see , cary in the dress , was at the very end and not very much at that . overall , this film was a real disappointment and letdown . the only consolation was that i saw it for free ; i did n't have to buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time that i could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way . i would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! to sum it up , a very very boring and dumb movie , not to waste your time on .
1	i loved it , the movie arrived so quickly it was awesome . it has brought back a lot of memories from my past . thank you
1	i have read a number of good reviews of this dvd on this site , especially the one written by dennis littrel . i will thus only add a small personal impression . i remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy ' so disturbed and unsure of himself . this is not what we were expected to see from western heroes . also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win . also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person . if he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly mexican woman ? i am only speaking about my own naivete of course . i too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety . this is to say that while i sensed somehow the movie is 'good ' i could not because of the perplexity i felt , enjoy it . the good guy does not run . he does stand up and alone face the bad guys . his fiancee though she has principles of non- violence when it comes down to it does the 'realistic and necessary thing ' to save the one she loves . a realistic moral hollywood drama , and of course made haunting by the 'do not forsake me oh my darling ' in the background
1	`` shampoo '' is probably the most sophisticated sex comedy ever made in this country . it 's a very clear-eyed ( and very funny ) look at how love and lust get inextricably mixed up with up with power , money , position , and politics . of course , contrary to almost every critique posted here , george ( warren beatty ) , the philandering beverly hills hairdresser , is the primary victim of the rules of the game , late-60s southern california-style . unlike the protagonist of the great renoir movie , george does n't end up dead , but he 's left alone , abandoned by all the women he 's bedded , looking like a naive fool . and that 's george 's sin -- he 's an uncynical romantic in a world that does n't know the difference between felt emotion and deliberate calculation . he sleeps with women because he genuinely likes them . for him , taking a woman to bed is an extension of doing her hair -- it 's an intimate act in which he makes her look and feel better . all the other characters in the movie use sex as part of a larger plan -- they each have some separate goal on their mind , which they achieve in one way or another , and george is left behind with his silly emotional and sexual vulnerabiliy . he 's don giovanni in reverse -- the boy who ca n't say no because he actually gives a damn -- and he pays a steep price for his availability . playing a slightly out of it dupe , beatty has never been better or more dazzlingly glamorous . and he 's surrounded by a flawless ensemble cast -- lee grant is simply astonishing as a deceived and deceiving beverly hills matron , and julie christie , in her flared pants and mini skirts , is peerlessy sexy as the 1968 version of a rodeo drive courtesan . thanks to robert towne , `` shampoo '' also has some of the most natural , unforced , yet revealing dialog ever heard in an american movie -- nothing is stylized or italicized , but every nonchalant remark hits target like a polished wilde epigram . delectable
0	jeremy brett was by this time indeed `` the dying detective , '' but his real-life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic rendition of one of conan doyle 's more tasteless holmes stories . the original features some of holmes ' worst and most insensitive treatment of poor watson , but since this series made such a thing of their friendship , the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it . stick with the brett episodes from the mid-80s , when he was fresh in the role and the adaptations were true and intelligent
0	when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black , white and jittery gray , the result had better be good . that fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money , push play alongside mr. benefit-of-a-doubt and strain to see if it works . thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically , that of color . the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that , despite some grand intention , do not work , or , in the alternative , do not work as well . citing two examples - sin city which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white , tantamount to robbery , and good night america which is all and about the same . the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together , there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point , one might be better served as a charcoal artist . color is the medium of life . from a budgetary perspective , black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color , which , in a good feature , can be excessive , are thus eliminated . yet complications arise - for instance - i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand . similarly , the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink , in shades of course , and we would never know . yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it ? one wonders , however , that , if pi production would have had more money , would they have opted for color ? moot point . it 's done . notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do , pi , although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work , clever symbolism and high-octane guts , seems to lanquish for other reasons . despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout , spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves , after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost . as as result , the movie stays earthbound , weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline ( obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind ) , unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there , failing repetitive effect and thin , uninspiring 2-d support cast , leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay . unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive . despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won . the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second , belly down the next . as a fine creative exercise , the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in . contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off - `` a beautiful mind ''
1	no one will doubt that woody allen is the only director who has consistently mastered the art of writing and directing intelligent , funny , unforgettable stories . these films are great examples of that . fromk annie hall to sleeper [ i have n't viewed stardust memories yet ] , you will be completely satisfied with your purchase . here 's an overview of the films : annie hall : allem 's best film , hands down . the story of a couple who meets in a new york tennis club . allen plays alvy singer , a carbon copy of allen 's stereotypical self [ neurotic , clumsy , `` suave '' ] , while keaton , who gives a stunning performance , plays annie hall , a country girl from wisconsin trying to find a life in new york . a great story about relationships . the last paragraph that allen narrates is fabulous . do n't watch this film first , or you may not appreciate allen 's other work as much ! bananas : on the sillier side , this film is about fielding mellish , another character based on himself . mellish works for a large corporation . testing products . if you are at all familiar with allen , you already know that there is a witty scene coming up . mellish travels to the small latin american country of san marcos to find something to do . he ends up becoming the communist dictator there , and that is all i will say . everything you always wanted to know about sex* *but were afraid to ask : a great satire on the popular book . this is a series of seven small sex stories , varying from gene wilder 's affair with a sheep to a giant , deadly mammary . watch for allen 's coolest role as fabrizio , the italian . interiors : a stunning film [ very serious ] about a wealthy long island family that steers away from the mother . this film is beautifully shot , and it really pays a lot of attention to showing every aspect of every character . tension builds quickly , and it stays until the end . love and death : one of my personal top five allen films . this one is about napoleon trying to take over russia . allen plays boris grushenko , a russian catholic , who falls in love with his distant cousin , sonja [ keaton ] . this one is nonstop laughs , but only if you are familiar with the war and the works of russian writers . it is still very funny otherwise , but not as deeply funny . manhattan : similar to annie hall , but a little different . allen plays isaac davis , who falls in love with a seventeen year old [ mariel hemingway ] , and also with mary [ keaton ] , an overly pretentious new yorker at the same time . this story is again about relationship , but this one is extreme . shot in black and white , and accompanied by a george gershwin soundtrack , many allen fans consider this film his love letter to new york city . it is also considered his best by many people . i think he has made better , but this is a stunning film . sleeper : sleeper is 'love and death ' set in the future . a great film about allen , who is frozen in 1973 , and defrosted 200 years later . great jokes , chase scenes , and more . in one scene , diane keaton and a leader of a revolutionist underground organization re-create scenes from his childhood . another joke about the nra . sleeper is probably the best film to see if one wants a good introduction to allen 's style . all in all , this collection is a must-own . also , at less than ten dollars per dvd , no fan should pass this up . separately , they cost more . buy this today and you will be granted a good taste in motion pictures
1	i like almost everything that andrew v. mclaglen directs . this film has quite a lot of good things to recommend it . mostly i like the opening civil war scene and later wayne , rock hudson and company doing battle with the invading french down in mexico . there 's enough humor , action and emotion to go around not to mention hugo montenegro 's very good score
0	rogers and hammerstein 's `` cinderella '' is one of my favorite musicals ever ! but does this rendition do it justice ? absolutely not ! ! ! ! ! more glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means . maybe if i was not enamored with leslie ann warren or julie andrews who make far better cinderellas i would have enjoyed this . i am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better . if you are a rogers and hammerstein fan like i am , you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones . its alot more exciting that the julie andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one . however a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other rogers and hammerstein cinderellas will appreciate it far better
0	well , i had to succumb . i was attracted to this alleged film by it 's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad . my low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded . this film reaches new cinematic depths . it 's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of `` plan 9 from outer space . '' it 's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they 're just desperate . tom green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence , ever ! i felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like rip torn and julie hagerty who signed onto this dross but , hey , they cashed the checks . watching a few minutes of this slop is painful . enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic . to get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness i 'm going to have to watch an actual good movie , like `` showgirls ''
0	i 'm a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm . and unfortunately , it is some of her worst acting work , posey , sing-song , and superficial . now , if you 've read her bio , and know what was going on with her and holden , that could explain it , but still , this film is very static . like most heburn films , a highlight is her clothes , her style , her self . this film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better . there are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here . this film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead . jayne mansfield could have been a hoot in this , thelma ritter too , in a very different way , somebody with less style and more off beat snap , crackle , and pop . ( thelma ritter and william holden paired in a romantic comedy ... i 'm all ready laughing ! ) before i hit this too harshly , this film was intended to be a trifle , the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles . for that , it is adequate . the remake , alex and emma suffers very much from the same problems . they actually improved the script , and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices , but both films seem to have suffered from `` settling for a star '' when a less mainstream , more zany actress was needed . ok , this does n't stink ... it has audrey , but it certainly does n't sizzle
0	rule number one if you 're making a stephen king movie , especially if it 's a tv movie ; make it scary or do n't make it at all ! the tommyknockers fails to do this miserably ! for most of the film , you 're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions . granted , that 's all in the book , but it written chillingly by king in a way only he can do it . there are some exciting alien moments at the end , but by then it 's too late . you 've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an x-files episode . on the plus side , i had no problem watching the infamous traci lords act like like a total slut ! bless her
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his `` harmful if swallowed '' c.d . the c.d . also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long . the one star rating is not based on the content . it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers
1	this movie was a good stay at home movie to watch with a friend or bf . gabe the lead character is a musical song writer who goes to a bar and sees a handsome gogo boy dancing on stage , after a few drinks gabe leaves and is on the train on his way home ... .the gogo boy from the bar ( strip joint ) walks in and sees gabe and sits down across from him ... gabe stares at him up and down . but gabes stop comes up and the gogo boy follows him out ... now they both go from place to place trying to find a place to do the deed ... but his str8 roomate interrupts , then gabes older friend offers his pad but he bumps into an old flame and now gabe and the gogo boy once again have no place to go ... .all in all ... its a great movie to watch with someone and cuddle ... funny and a good watch . enjoy
1	i 've seen it on the orginal screen in a theather , saw it many times on the vcr i have ... ... ... this new dvd is superior to both in it 's clarity , color and a real gem to own
1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it . they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out . could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again . update : most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection . after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down . i upgraded and this helped . i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours . if you are having trouble read your sattelite `` fair access '' policy
0	i do n't know what 's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews . this movie was awful . there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag . not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa , melle mel , and the rock steady crew could save it . i could n't wait for it to be over with . the `` graffiti '' throughout the movie was absolutely awful . ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair . guy davis was fine back then , but not anymore . rae dawn chong was just annoying . this is one movie i never want to see again
0	i remember when this ran on espn2 during the week between christmas new year 's back in 2000 . i 'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies ... but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel . pettine sr. seems like a class act worthy of the respect `` local legend '' high school football coaches deserve . his son , pettine jr , coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work . maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt did n't record right thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale . rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head-to-head season finale against the son , pettine jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half-hearted handshake . so much for paternal respect love . had the potential to be great w/the setup . but do n't let the glowing summary trick you ... there 's no emotional payoff to speak of for `` the last game . '' football , after all , has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions . your time would be better spent watching brian 's song , rudy or the nbc series `` friday night lights . '' even reruns of mtv 's `` two-a-days '' about hoover of alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc/reality tv style
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman . if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups , this is the series . i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean . that is hard to do . the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys , they are that good . in my humble opinion . you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit .
0	a typical altman film . made to please himself not an audience . i do n't know how he keeps getting financing . no one sees them except family and friends . additionally . it suffers from soft focus , out of focus , photography that will drive you nuts ! after awhile you do n't give a damn whether they have a wedding or not
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised . normally , i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan . however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch . while the idea behind the movie is good , it could have been more entertaing , dramatic , or suspensful . as another reviewer remarked , i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else . but , i did suffer through to the end , where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
0	for any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students : beware ! ! first of all , i 've heard of taking `` liberties '' with a book but this is ridiculous ! sex between farmer jones and the neighbor farmer 's wife is not in the book , but sure is shown in the movie . i was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was `` knocking against the wall '' . utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students . i expect better from hallmark entertainment , family home entertainment , etc ... second , there is a `` no rating '' statement on the dvd - i 'm angry about this and do n't appreciate being taken advantage of . there was no warning about adult situations . it 's a shame that one ca n't be truthful in advertising . buyer beware
0	i might as well re-draft this review as only 0 of 2 people enjoyed the first draft . that 's would n't normally phase me , but i can do better for you in this case . i first saw a segment of st-2 on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct-to-dvd release . this ticked me off a bit because i 'm a fan of phil tippett , who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie . having now got the dvd , i have unreeled it from the beginning and i find it loads more ambitious , intelligent and well rendered by director tippett than i had given the producers credit for permitting . tippett has been an innovator in the cgi field -- stop-motion , go-motion , and transitional model-to-cgi models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures . among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first starship troopers movie . the multitudes of individually rendered creatures in starship troopers are spotlessly realistic . as a general rule , if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct-to-dvd release , they intend to suffocate the production -- whether the franchise has been good , bad or mediocre in the market -- by simply failing to provide a generous -- or even a minimal budget -- to sustain life support in any recognizable way . trust me -- starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises . starship troopers ( the first ) was not a runaway commercial hit on first run , apparently , when compared to its $ 100 million cost . but sci-fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories , and it is certain that this ambitious sci-fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings -- and income -- for the rest of the studios ' and the filmmakers ' natural lives . nobody loses on this one . a sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long-term . regardless of that , director phil tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film , he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget . looking at the bug war scenes in the first act , you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all . credit mr. tippett for that achievement . in fact , there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie , which have added impact as a result . now for a few notes : i would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new , logical ways . i would like to have seen bug life-cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies -- what has been done and re-done in sci-fi productions as far back as alien . the creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped , exoskeleton , hive-bred civilization are unlimited . there is no need at all for the writers or fx techs to resort to the over-used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human 's mouth to another human mouth , for example . nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from invasion of the body snatchers to the hidden to the thing that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal . it has been done to death . let 's move on and discard that whole much copied process . i could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end . there is plenty of fresh , untapped bug behavior to mine , and there is far too much writing talent involved with the starship troopers series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture . still in all , phil tippett 's feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors . i look forward to his future development as a director .
1	i expected to learn how to build a gypsy wagon so i could join a caravan . this movie did not help at all . worthless ! i thought i would find a complex and riveting tapestry of deep and well-developed characters and storylines . what a disappointment ! i just knew i would come away with a better understanding of cutting edge business management techniques ! total waste of time ! instead , i had to sit through a long film of incredible landscapes , beautiful people , and amazing music that altogether gave me a new and wonderful understanding of gypsies , eurasia , and history . and i watched it about thirty times . it 's excellent - i mean , terrible ! whatever . get it and watch it

0	this is a poor excuse of a movie . the actors are less than right for these rolls . i will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash ...
0	i bought the dvd based on all the positive reviews , and i think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie . my husband and i , who love old movies , hated it . my teenagers just found it completely uninteresting . it was apparently made about the time alaska became a state , although it deals with an earlier time period , and the movie has not aged well . the story was uninteresting , the direction was uneven , the comedy ( mostly bar fights ) felt forced and awkward . stewart granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there . fabian 's acting was unmemorable and we felt capucine was miscast . we got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like alaska ( it was obviously shot in southern california ) . i gave it two stars because i was able to sit through the entire thing , but i spent most of it asking myself `` why ? why am i wasting my time like this ?
0	i do n't usually make a point to watch films this bad ( predictable plot , laughable dialog , horrible music soundtrack , etc ) , but when i saw that my all-time favorite actor jeremy brett had a brief but memorable role in `` shameless '' ( originally titled `` mad dogs and englishmen '' ) , i could n't resist . it 's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic sherlock holmes in the beloved granada tv series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy . it 's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman . regardless , as usual , he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it . i only wished the director has used brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric . a young elizabeth hurley makes a mediocre attempt to portray a bored little rich girl with drug problems and c. thomas howell does his best to seem sexy in a grunge biker kind of way . but brett 's booming voice , subtle expressions and dynamic presence wakes you up for just long enough to pay attention to his character . once he disappears from the screen , you realize all too soon that the rest of the film is worthless . it takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck , and i 'm sorry to see that this was brett 's only chance to do a modern-day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away . he briefly commented in an interview why he did the role , and soon realized the film was a disaster . on `` mad dogs and englishmen '' ( 1995 ) -- `` i was mad to do it , but i wanted to show the world that i was still alive and i could do other things apart from sherlock holmes . i hope they do n't release it ... ''
0	b grade movie , really poor script . bulk of movie is boring , superficial , stereotypical . real purpose of movie is baptist condemnation of the supernatural . story line . the wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit . the husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife . on the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life . overtones . the leading man is depicted as unstable , self-centered , reckless , irresponsible , and fantasy-prone.before and during the two year period . when revealed to the those assembled , the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned . his `` giving up the ghost '' is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life . the daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head-on crash with a car.leaving her frightened and distraught . media messages . the film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo . 1 . spirit contact is dangerous , selfish , and emotionally unhealthy . 2 . the personal grieving journey of another should be co-opted by peers . 3 . condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact . there should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like `` what did she look like ? '' `` what kinds of things did she say ? '' 4 . messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted . in short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones.. in life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us . in passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond . when william blake 's brother passed , he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all . many near-death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves . the inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds . the same is true for after-death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film
1	my side of the mountain is a terrific and educational movie . i ca n't agree with some of the negative reviews here . this is an interesting movie the whole family can watch together . little sam gribley is a walking encyclopedia . this movie would be good for classrooms . watch it and learn ! i 'm going for the novel .
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	i 'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond . there really was n't much here i liked . the soundtrack was the usual `` pap '' you 'd expect from a family friendly movie , though the sets were nice . it seems this movie was just miscast . mel just does n't do comedy all that well , at least for a lead role . jame garner , the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander . and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character . although the cast is a powerhouse ( on paper ) , sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball . an example : there was a sequence when bret asks his friends ( who are standing behind him ) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting ; which as it turns out they are unable to do . instead jodie and james , blow madly , just like the movie . this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like ''the three amigo 's '' ; on paper you would think it could n't miss , but on film it 's painful to watch
1	follow one girl 's story into adult hood . a beautiful story of romance that is realistic and tragic . if you have a romantic bone in your body and you do n't mind crying , buy this movie and watch it with your girl friends . i lend this movie out as well . there is adult content in this with nudity not for the faint of heart . have your tissues ready .
0	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy . other than that , it 's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy , predictable , low-budget horror movies from the early nineties . the fx are funny at first , but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy . the acting is uniformly terrible , and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her
1	thirty years later it is hard to imagine `` the story of adele h '' without the then twenty-year old isabelle adjani as the title character . but at the time truffaut 's decision to cast the young french theatre star was very risky . not because there was any doubt about adjani 's acting , but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue . would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful , passionate , and intelligent were rejected ? and could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer . but truffaut knew what he was doing because adjani 's adele hugo is 100 % convincing . and rather than going for audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over adele 's self-destructive behavior . adjani 's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as truffaut wants you convinced that the world offers unlimited possibilities for adele if only she can let go of her obsession . adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when adele 's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering . apparently adele had other issues before going on her obsessive quest for love . her sister drowned a few years before and her parents had always strongly favored her sister . adele has recurrent nightmares about drowning . marriage and her pursuit of pinson are her only way to escape from her famous father . truffaut 's stays with blacks , browns , and blues ; with much of each frame filled with shadows ; not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little non-fantasy happiness during her life . the camera loves adjani , a good thing as she is on screen for over 90 % of the film . she was the youngest nominee ever for best actress . it was the best performance of the 1970 's , probably no one but adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence . it is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound . as roger ebert noted : `` truffaut finds a certain nobility in adele . he quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice : she writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover . he sees this , not as a declaration of love , but as a statement of a single-mindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it . adele was mad , yes , probably - but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it 's just as well pinson never married her . he would have become a disappointment '' . then again , what do i know ? i 'm only a child .
1	davy crockett is one of walt disney 's most endeared and remembered live action characters from the television and silver screen as personified by fess parker . this colorful and entertaining film was re-edited from three segments of disney 's tv show for theatrical distribution . parker , with his coonskin cap and homespun drawl and witticism created a nationwide phenomenon in 1955. who can forget `` the ballad of davy crockett '' composed by george bruns and tom blackburn . buddy ebsen played his sidekick george russel , whose adventures take them from tennessee to washington , d.c. to the alamo . the film 's third act focusing on the defense of the alamo , though well remembered , is somewhat labored until we see the final image of davy crockett passing into legend and glory . this straightforward and beautifully photographed film expounds the virtues of honesty , integrity and bravery . highly recommended family viewing personally produced by walt disney
1	if you like denzel washington , i think this is one of his best movies yet . he is sexy , and so is his co-stars . the movie delivers great action , suspense and surprises at the end .
1	kevin spacey . i 'll write it again . kevin spacey . whether he 's playing keiser soze , a pyschopath in seven , or an alien in k-pax , any film he touches seems to sizzle . swimming with sharks is no exception ; in fact , we get to see kevin in a role that resembles the one he portrayed in glengary glen ross , only magnified thirty of forty levels on the pompousity chart . frank whaley plays his underling in the corporate world . you might remember him as the victim of samuel l. jacksons rant in pulp fiction right before he gets his head blown off or as the young kid from field of dreams - playing a young burt lancaster . well , as goofy as it might sound , whaley does a wonderful job in swimming with sharks . you emphathize with his character , even when he turns from naive victim to unflinching nut-case at the end . as for premise , kevin spacey plays a corporate boss who is showing his yes man , played by whaley , the tricks to moving ahead . in the mean time , however , he does everything he can to make his employee 's life a living hell , thus driving the young worker into ... ... the last segment of this film is the most amazing . i loved the twist . many , i imagine , will not . the film quickly moves from humor to dark drama in a matter of minutes , and the twist may upset many , especially spacey 's delivery in the last clutch scenes . this movie is basically the director 's rant and rave come to full life . it 's based on his own experience in the corporate world and be warned , untold buckets of foul language await you , so be ready .

0	i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film . but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy , i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor . over-zealous and fanatic ( as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the protestant/catholic conflict ) , she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes . and throughout the film , there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever . i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived , i would recommend the superb bbc series , elizabeth r with glenda jackson . and if you want even further background , look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell . tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary , queen of scots ( although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example , mary stuart and elizabeth never met , although it was mary 's great desire ) and even another title , anne of the thousand days . those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times . this film just does n't cut it
1	i really love bones . it has everything : suspense , drama , humor , pretty people , fun storylines . i have yet to miss an episode , and even into season 2 this is probably my favorite . it adds depth to all of the characters . also , the winter holidays are my favorite time of year . i like holidays that are about what is good in the world . bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day . i cry through half this episode , but in a completely good way . buy , watch it , love it . but watch it with a friend if you do n't want to cry alone . so moving , great performances by the whole cast . emily deschanel was powerful in this one , she brings real vulnerability to brennan here . david boreanaz , as always the perfect sympathetic hero , loveably old-fashioned . cute , funny moments . touching , poignant moments . this really is the best of what is great about bones

0	nighly stylized movie that uses sky captain cpg with an equilibrium theme . in the future , a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes . i 'm good with that part , and mila jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `ultraviolet ' . what does n't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air . there is no explaination how , and the dumbass drones after her do n't have the same ability . personally , i wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded army of top notch killers ! the whole film is shot in cg touches a la sky captain and the world of tommorrow . this supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world 's `vampire ' problem . in reality , it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography . normally , i would have given this a 1 star . poor piece of film . period . but , after the resident evil series , i felt mj did a very nice job here . thus the 2 stars . do not buy , but wsit until it is on cable , which i did . even then , i got it on starz , and used dvr time

1	legendary stars billy barty and diana rigg bring one of the world 's most beloved fairy tales to life in the cannon movie tale , `` snow white . '' starring beautiful and charming sarah patterson ( the company of wolves ) in the title role as the princess who fled her wicked , jealous , and murderous stepmother 's castle as a child , `` snow white '' tells the tale of how the princess is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs living in a cottage in the forest . as the dwarfs go off to dig in their mines each day , snow white cooks and keeps house for years , growing into a sweet and lovely young woman . but , as snow white grows ever more beautiful , the evil queen grows ever more jealous . consulting her magic mirror and book of spells for ways to terminate snow white , the dwarfs must repeatedly undo her vicious magic . it seems the final spell is beyond even the dwarfs abilities to break though . their only hope lies in a young prince who is returning home from a long journey still seeking a great discovery to satisfy the longing in his heart . `` snow white '' sits among the best of the nine wonderful cannon movie tales , which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date . sticking more closely to the original stories from the brothers grimm , `` snow white '' and the other cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly . `` snow white '' features some of the best songs in the lot , and it 's clear that diana rigg really has a ball with her villainous role . it 's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the disney channel 's 1980 's and early 90 's glory are finally available on dvd ( most of them at least ) . the dvds include trailers ( not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically ) , and `` snow white '' is the only one of the four that i currently own that is presented in a letterbox format ( though not much of one ) . the cannon movie tales are mostly family fun , though be warned that some can have their scary moments ( for example , `` red riding hood , '' my favorite , is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening ) . the other cannon movie tales , all of which i highly recommend , are : rumpelstiltskin , the emperor 's new clothes , red riding hood , puss in boots , hansel and gretel , beauty and the beast , the frog prince , and sleeping beauty . those last two have not yet been released to dvd , and i have yet to see rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores , though amazon seems to carry it . i wish to get them all , but currently only own my favorites : red riding hood , snow white , puss in boots ( starring christopher walken ! ) , and hansel and gretel . fairy tale fanatics should own all these films , and i also highly recommend my top favorites , the disney animated versions . also , for a scarier version of snow white , pick up the outstanding , `` snow white : a tale of terror , '' starring the beautiful monica keena . more recommendations : shelley duvall 's faerie tale theatre collection ( also best known from the disney channel airings ) , shrek and shrek 2 , the slipper and the rose ( for a live-action cinderella ) , ever after ( another live-action cinderella ) , the adventures of pinocchio ( 1996 ) , peter pan ( 2003 ) , the wizard of oz , return to oz , and rodger 's and hammerstein 's cinderella ( 1965 ) among others !
1	firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt . it is simply the best sci-fi ... no scratch that , the best tv i 've scene scince the x files . the acting is very good , the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode i felt like i was part of the crew . i cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance , does that remind you of anything ? . so here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original . what happened to tv that makes us think . dont get me wrong but , saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but , its all the same ! where is capt kirk , where is moulder , where is river ? ? ? : ( science fiction does'nt mean out of this world , firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the 21st century . watch the first episode and you 'll be hooked , i was

0	this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb . i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again , but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie . the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon . they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done . i do not recommend this version to anyone . the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job
1	i remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since . the movie starts off at the 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b . sweeny ) is a talented hockey player and kate mosley ( moira kelly ) is a pairs figure skater . both have mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering a career ending injury and kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations . the movie picks up a few years later with kate having trouble getting a new partner and doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player . added to the mix is kate 's russian couch anton pamchenko ( played by the great roy dotrice ) who decides rick will be kate 's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 olympics . at first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating , but that is not entirely so . the scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater . in truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice . it is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another , to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love . the thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads sweeney and kelly . they are magic together on the screen , so much so that i am surprised they never paired up again for another movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone . on a side note about the dvd , the only special feature is the theatrical trailer . there are no deleted scenes . this is where i have a question , because the version of the film on this dvd and that i 've scene on tv in recent years is not the one i remember seeing in college . i distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony . i somewhat like that version because what doug and kate won in that version was so much more . so where is the version with the alternative ending ? ? ?

1	`` breaking away '' is a true rarity : a feel-good movie that does n't that is n't silly . yes , there are plenty of laughs in it , but they 're the result of great acting and writing , not the cheap , crude one-liners that litter so many of today 's so-called `` comedies . '' and while the movie will tug at your heartstrings , it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos . but i also feel sort of sad whenever i watch `` breaking away . '' the small-town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most americans . and are there any old swimming holes anymore , like the quarry that the characters visit ? or have they all been paved over , for `` luxury '' mcmansion subdivisions ? shut me up ! just watch `` breaking away '' and enjoy it
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era - katharine ross and sam elliot . it 's just fun , not really all that scary or even too tense . basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance . roger daltry makes an appearance . the deaths are all way over the top , and it 's just fun . dvd is the movie plus a trailer . that 's about it , but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie . great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire .
1	i just read dirk 's `` spolier '' ending to the mothman prophecies and had to say huh ? demonic , fallen angles ? what ? did we watch the same movie ? if all you go by is the movie , that might be the impression you 're left with . but if you 've ever looked into the events that happened around point pleasant , or any of the books on the subject , you 'll see that the mothman was more ufo related than anything . at same time of the mothman sightings the point pleasant area was in a wave of ufo reports , men-in-black , and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky . in fact , mothman played only a very small part in the drama , it was by far predominately ufo related , as keel makes clear . unfortunately , the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely , and so the happenings at point pleasant lost their entire frame of reference . if you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened , you might come to the conclusion of the mothman being evil , demonic , fallen angles , whatever you like . but if you research the incident at all , you 'll see you 're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie . and if , like dirk , you thereby think you know all about what mothman actually was based on just the movie alone , then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a hollywood writer 's imagination and script and nothing more . mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be . do n't judge by the movie , read the book

1	this movie is so stupid it is funny . i saw it when it first came out and i still have n't forgotten it nor will i ever . this is what the writers of the groove tube , saturday night live , and second city television are all about . watch this film and see a true comedy classic . individual skits like `` catholic high school girls in trouble '' could have been made into a full length movie all to itself . it was an era where one did n't have to be politically correct . this is what comedy is all about . forget the garbage we see today . forget martin lawrence or cedric the entertainer . see kentucky fried movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was . oh , by the way , stephen bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he is n't singing `` on and on ''
1	i do n't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles . they seemed to have had a ball
1	the immortal yi soon shin is the best drama i have seen ever . korean , american , does n't matter ! this is better than anything i have ever seen on tv or in the movies . hollywood can not touch this one ! kim myoung min ( yi soon shin ) is outstanding in this ! ( no wonder he won the 2005 kbs best actor award for iyss ) it starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional , funny , sad , and can make you angry ! ! the numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal ! ! he put his country above all else and kim myoung min did a great job of portraying that ! my whole family , kids and all , watched this with me and loved it ! i can see why yi soon shin is korea 's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	this is a good alternative to the bombard of hollywood films . it potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly . i live in one of the asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another . watching this film , i came to realize how lonely one 's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries . because things are so modernized , things have got so mechanical , human relation is no exception . this happens to the mother in this film . it is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son 's family , everybody is so busy with his/her business , everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around . their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business . her being attracted to the young carpenter is a sign that she actually needs attention and that she is lonely rather than the raw 'love ' between a man and a woman . i recommend this film to those who love to watch a film about love , family and relationship .
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met ... head-to-head . this movie answers that question very well . no cheesiness . we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count , and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest . great saturday evening movie
1	there are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you , score a ticket to `` jurassic park '' and spielberg for that , and there are films with gravitas , that move you , disturb you , drag you to the altar kicking and screaming , to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.. '' badlands , '' terrence malick 's 1973 directorial debut , an overlooked jewel of a film , forcibly moves you , and takes an unsavory subject , the charles starkweather serial killings ' crime spree , up in the vacated badlands of south dakota , and refines it til you posit , `` how did we get here as a country ? what went wrong ? `` ..and then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers ( martin sheen as kit carruthers , sissy spacek as holly sargis ) on a thrill-killing `` honeymoon '' , onto the silver screen and make it empathetic , palatable..why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life , lost highway delinquents , who shoot a parent , assume they can get away consequence-free , and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred ? ..however , `` badlands '' is rooted in unfortunate fact , these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in north america , and malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey , deeper and deadlier into an american wasteland..the film is palpable evil genuis , arguably a top ten american film classic , irrespective it was shot by a first time director , with an unknown cast.. '' badlands '' resonates with gritty authenticity , cinematic style , fierce inhumanity , and the most haunting musical score ( erik satie 's gymnopedies 3 ) that underwrites a sissy spacek voice over narration , spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal 's office , when in fact holly ( sissy spacek ) is the fractured other half of the kit carruthers ' killing machine , a bossom buddy in crime..some films are purposefully pure entertainment , escapist faire.. '' badlands '' on the other hand is rare art , belongs in a museum
1	this movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way . the movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure . it is the very opposite of saccharine glop . it is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie . the movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters .
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software . the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it . blah . you 're better off buying the dvd for $ 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer .
0	this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw . i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow , what a mistake . the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more .
1	once more the irreverent vision of georges bernard shaw , carves in relief with this story about a rich girl who decides to join the salvation army . wendy hiller one of my beloved `` brides '' of the screen makes a delightful and terrific performance in this satire of mistakes where she will discover the other side of the life .
0	the extreme reviews here are very misleading ; people either say it 's the worst film ever made or godard 's best film . do n't believe either camp . if you 're not an expert on godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema , i could definitely see a person writing off this movie as `` sheer pretentious crap '' , but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance . on the other hand , those who say this is godard 's finest work must be riding high on acid and marxism themselves . the truth of the matter is that `` weekend '' , like every one of godard 's post-anna karina films , is more a flawed experiment than anything else : on occasion , interesting and thought-provoking , but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them . i respect godard 's attempt to create a new cinema built on `` ideas '' rather than `` emotion '' , but in my opinion , he went too far in this direction . a piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and do n't we have enough of that in our crude , consumerist society ? and as far as experiments go , much of what he was doing in `` weekend '' , he had already done and with vastly better results in `` pierrot le fou '' . that film was a perfect balance between godard the political-scientist and godard the post-modern film-maker . plus , `` pierrot le fou '' benefited by having jean-paul belmondo and anna karina . they brought heart and humor to godard 's abstract explosion of ideas ; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor ( s ) that he never achieved again . `` weekend '' starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam , leading to a car-crash ... but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space . you really wish belmondo and karina would pop in and show the cast they do n't have to be mere nails to godard 's hammer .
1	hey , i wo n't pretend to write anything better than `` chris kent '' did below in march of 2003 . just read his excellent review that not only captures the film 's qualities , but also the era in which the film was released
1	derek jarman 's 'sebastiane ' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas . this is a master work and should be in any serious film buff 's cabinet . ( i should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like the four seasons in new york . it 's visual beauty should be constantly on view . not one element could be added or deleted . if i may continue the painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into a composition which i think is flawless . the men are beautiful , but in a tangible human manner . the settings , whether diocletian 's startling lurid palace or the rough bare terrain of sardinia evoke both pagan and christian motifs flawlessly . good and evil ( and all shades between ) found in both places ; the irony of the world as it is and has always been . the homoerotic nature of the film is vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well be set in modrn iraq with 21st century troops . i felt each character 's longings , whether for the god of carnal flesh or that of human love and companionship or a spiritual and other worldly deity . the recognituion that each of these forms of eros may entertwine and meld is genious . it is everyman . it is a scrupulus portrait of the easily duplicit qualities of beauty , deceipt , brutality and even truth . powerful stuff .
0	there are bad movies , and then there are bad movies . `` universal soldier : the return '' is a cosmically bad movie , a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to `` manos : the hands of fate '' for comparison . the first `` universal soldier '' film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars jean-claude van damme and `` rocky '' refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do : people perished in violent ways , stuff exploded , and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film . even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme 's female sidekick greatly helped the film . the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back . it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel . the second , and one hopes final , installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open-mouthed awe watching it . i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity . expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll . van damme returns as luc , the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film . on this outing he now works for dr. dylan cotner ( xander berkeley ) , a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s.e.t.h . luc , with his female sidekick maggie ( kiana tom ) , helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers . the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river , a jaunt filled with explosions , stunts , gunfire , and the briefest glimpse of tom 's incredibly fit form . as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things : kiana tom is incredibly hot but ca n't act her way out of a paper bag , luc has a daughter named hillary ( karis paige bryant ) who you just know will get into trouble at some point , and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo ( bill goldberg ) and the one played by michael jai white . frankly , turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom 's amazing physique is probably a good thing . everything that follows is dull , predictable , and so full of plot holes as to defy description . `` universal soldier : the return '' feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film . sure enough , cotner 's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers . in the resulting conflagration s.e.t.h . implants its consciousness in michael jai white , luc and his loved ones flee from the compound , and the military swoops in to contain the problem . an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government 's latest shenanigans . predictably , van damme and schanz team up to track down ... er ... well , track down something to defeat the supercomputer . i think they need some code to shut the system down , but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out . even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult 's only club ca n't make this turkey fly . it 's dull , folks , and painfully so . by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s.e.t.h . back at the shattered compound -- with an injured hillary 's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc ( geez , what a surprise there ! ) -- i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck . how bad can it be , you ask ? read on ... plot holes in this film are innumerable , as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager 's face . for example , luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner `` cured '' him by restoring him to life ; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers . what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications ? he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat ? we do n't find out from van damme , who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications . i could go on , but let 's discuss the performances instead -- or the lack thereof . i should say i adore kiana tom ; she 's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth 's rotation , but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth . another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg , whose `` funny '' lines are anything but . and the more i think about heidi schanz , the less i think of her . you have to wonder about a film where jean-claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast . you might think a movie this foolhardy should n't contain any bonus features on dvd . you would be wrong . trailers for this film , `` the return , '' `` double team , '' `` desert heat , '' `` knock off , '' `` maximum risk , '' and `` nowhere to run '' showcase the dubious career of jean-claude van damme . a making of feature , a van damme career retrospective ( ha ! ) , a michael jai white feature , and talent bios round out the disc . my advice to those viewers thinking of renting `` universal soldier : the return '' ? run , my friends , run far , far away and do n't look back .
0	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all , it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i 'm downloading it for free . i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds ... i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
1	i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned , even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times , ' to reference hannah arendt . this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description
0	ken russell is a gifted director , as his erratic career has proved , but even the great vanessa redgrave ca n't save this one . `` the devils , '' a gaudy , loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism , went painfully awry . grisly images of plague victims , quack cures , peculiar enemas , and oliver reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail -- unfortunately , they are merely stomach-turning . a stocky , wild-eyed oliver reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as father grandier , the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century french town , and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake . gemma jones is one bright spot as grandier 's innocent love interest , and ms. redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of sister jeanne , but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing . not for the faint of heart
1	my brother , henry , always said this was his favorite movie . he loved film noir ... ( although i did n't know what that was at the time ) and , of course , he loved richard widmark in his role . looking back , widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this ( he was nominated ) but there are many oscar `` should'ves '' . if you like prison/gangster movies , classic film noir , richard widmark , victor mature and , of course , brian dunleavy , you 've got ta see/own this ... if you havn't/do n't already
1	this one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even booth has a heart ... well , more so than we already know . the ending got me , i got misty over it . enjoy with someone you love
1	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville . a prison camp that turned into a death camp . not enough food , water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there . the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers . basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them . a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
1	there is no way around it , no matter how it is staged shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play . that it is acted by two of britains foremost stage actors of the time , kenneth branagh and emma thompson ( who at this stage were still married ) adds to the feeling . there is some over the top voice projection , but generally this feels light , fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of shakespeares frothiest plays . much ado about nothing really is just what it says . the premise is that the duke returns from the wars with a half-brother whom dislikes him but has reconciled with him simply to create problems . which he manages to do , embroiling the hapless hero ( the heroine of the story ! ) and her love . it is all based on falsehood and nothing . branagh and thompson play the battling ex-lovers who are reconciled during the course of the movie , but this does n't stay their battling wits and shrewdness . this is one point where their clear diction and stage presence makes a huge difference as each word and inference can be celarly understood . there are wonderful set scenes - the arrival of the duke and his men , and the finish with the dancing through the grounds was gorgeous . the real winner of the movie has to be the house and grounds it is set in - how wonderful ! who would n't want to live in italy after seeing this movie - and a nice way to learn some of shakespeare good fun
0	if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''

0	i purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed . i have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here ; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy . i remember watching not only the first broadcast on nbc but several broadcasts years after that , with different casts . it was and still is my favorite christmas story . i will certainly purchase the schippers cd and hope to see another video or dvd in the future
0	i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [ people ] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case , death -- with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his `` dignity , '' why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1	herman wouk 's book `winds of war ' became a bestseller upon its publication , just like its sequel `war and remembrance ' a few years later . these thick books , joining the fictional and historical events during second world war , provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the tv miniseries . this 6-dvd set covers the first book , with an 18-hour series shot in 1983 . the plot concerns a military family named henry , scattered and absorbed by the winds of war . we follow the patriarch victor `pug henry ( robert mitchum ) , an experienced military officer who in the spring 1939 is appointed to be a military attaché for the usa in berlin . he is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife rhoda ( polly bergen ) . their children include an oldest son , the flyboy warren ( ben murphy ) , another son byron ( jan-michael vincent ) who is in italy and falls in love with a bit older jewish girl natalie ( ali mcgraw ) , who is the niece of the famous american-jewish writer dr. aaron jastrow ( john houseman ) . the daughter madeleine ( lisa eilbacher ) is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl . in berlin pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the nazi germany of that time ( like the fact jews are treated second-class ) and predicts the upcoming pact between hitler ( günter meisner ) and stalin , both of who he gets to meet during the series . byron and natalie witness the first days of war , being caught in the midst of warsaw , where natalie followed her fiancé , the american diplomat leslie slote ( david dukes ) . the series mixes the lives of the henrys with the historical events of the war ( the occupations of poland and france ; the blitz in london ; the nazi invasion of the soviet union ; the beginnings of the `final solution ' behind the lines of the occupied russian territory ; the japanese attack on pearl harbor to name a few ) . the last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of pearl harbor : the german offensive is halted on the outskirts of moscow , pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war , unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend ( victoria tennant ) , byron fights in the submarine , while in the meantime natalie , who fell in love with byron and bore him a son , is left onboard a ship in naples which is awaiting to live for palestine , since she and her uncle could not find their way out of fascist italy , due to his passport complications . the above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem , it is not a soap opera , but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact . pug henry gets to meet all the important players of the war ( churchill , hitler , roosevelt , stalin ... ) and in this respect is somewhat similar to young indiana jones . the war itself is shown from these two viewpoints : the henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs. the historical ones ( hitler and his generals etc . ) there are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time . one of them is the excellent casting . robert mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of pug and he does it in an excellent way . ali macgraw 's headstrong natalie makes a fine contrast to jan-michael vincent 's younger byron . the historical characters are done more than convincingly . thusly ralph bellamy is the definite fdr ( a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre ) and howard lang makes a believable churchill . one must make a special reference to günter meisner and his portrayal of adolf hitler . as it will be seen in the sequel , the director and producer dan curtis wanted hitler to be overplayed . the reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way . günter meisner , the late german actor who played hitler few times during his career , although a bit too old for the role , managed to keep things under control , so despite the fact his führer is stiffed and not altogether perfect , he manages to give a hint of the evil personage hitler was . this is important to note , since his successor to the role for `war and remembrance ' , the british actor steven berkoff , was awful , playing the character as a total one-dimensional yelling buffoon . the role of hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character , as shown by bruno ganz in the recent movie `downfall ' . one of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location , with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy . most scenes were shot in my hometown zagreb , the capital of croatia , then still part of ex-yugoslavia . the producers managed to use zagreb 's past as one of the former austro-hungarian capitals to recreate berlin , lisbon , warsaw , etc . the scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly , thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer . other locations included usa , italy and some more . but the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which does n't let go for a moment . it is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel , `war and remembrance ' , ( the narrow scope of the victims of the holocaust being one of them ) are not present here . one can only get a hint of some of the future slips here , for example , the subtle message that all the germans are bad and all americans good . this dvd collection of the series deserves a+ . seven dvds come packed in a nice sleeve . besides the series , there are several interesting extra features : through the interviews with the cast , crew and herman wouk we learn about the process of adaptation , casting , shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace . some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in zagreb . for anyone enjoying modern history , an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in second world war , this is a must-have . highly recommendable
0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage . the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver . the most interesting part is all the shark footage ... the best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten , the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat . this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot . so where did this hook come from ? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie
0	lorna is pretty , and her suitor is devoted . the story holds your attention . for many that is enough . some auspicious beginnings , without depth . so maybe 3-stars for some people . i give 2-stars , if i do not keep it to watch again in later years . i found the romance unfulfilling , and so the movie . romance movies that i liked better are : `` north south '' , `` pride prejudice '' -1940 , 1996 2006 , `` wives and daughters '' , and `` a walk to remember '' . adventure with romance : `` the scarlet pimpernel '' .

0	this is n't funny . it is n't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could have been great , if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director , but it did n't , so it turned out mediocre at best . unfortunately , i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch . i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read , this was going to be a brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now that we 've watched it , he and i both know better . we know it 's dreadful , and i can only imagine all the nice things i 'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity . the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before . i 'm pleased to say i won the argument . that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me . in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic ' as others so often describe it . i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie , or to find it even a little bit funny , but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards . if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up a copy of flash gordon . that has great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , and a soundtrack by queen . furthermore , it has stood the test of time and is still great today , unlike 'the ice pirates ' , which has dated really badly . better yet , get hold of some 'red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good , it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies

1	this has got to be the funniest , most warped show on cable today . it 's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an irish pub in philadelphia . they care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money . they constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine . to give you an idea of the show 's themes : there are episodes that revolve around one of the characters trolling for dates at an abortion rally ; another in which the gang tries to outdo each other by pretending to be crippled , just to see who can get the most attention and sympathy from strangers ; and an episode in which the gang charges people to view a `` vision '' of the virgin mary ( actually a water stain in the bar ) . the dialogue is made up of all the things people are thinking but wo n't say . no tender or sappy moments here , these are episodes you would never see on the hallmark channel or lifetime . one of the most unique comedies on tv , and by far one of the best . i look forward to many more new seasons of `` it 's always sunny ... '' and am hopeful it does not lose its edge or pursue milktoast or nonoffensive story lines .
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love . with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie . for those expecting a movie like a hard days night , it is nothing like that . this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear . it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady . i wont tell u the ending , but this is a true story . all in all i thought this was a great movie . you should defiently buy it

0	my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park , a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles . i moved to echo park in late 2004 . it 's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs , dropping-out , and domestic violence . and it 's all here , told through the eyes of latina teenagers . it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played . i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven . i also found myself not caring about any of the characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes to jail . whatever ! as an aside , though , the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called ernesto . luckily , it 's just a coincidence
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them

0	i remember seeing children of the corn right after reading stephen king 's short story version in his classic book , night shift . i was excited because king 's story was such good scary fun . well , i watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was . while the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror , the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze . king 's story was short ( like 10-20 pages ) and sweet , w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields . the movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter . the running time is 90 minutes , including about an hour 's worth of padding . cotc would have made an excellent addition to one of king 's anthology movies like creepshow . as it stands , it 's bloated and pretty boring . of course , linda hamilton is in it , which is why i gave it an extra star ...

0	man , i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking , but it should be illegal ! this is , first off , a terrible dvd : 4:3 ( full screen ) format , with a dark , muddy picture . worse , the plot is typical , predictable , and poorly written . other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body , sitting through this fiasco is a total bore . i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie , since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this . that is probably the fault of the director , erik anjou , a third-rate director ( at best ! ) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary . gee , i wonder why he is n't in more demand ( not ! ) ! i can enjoy `` b '' movies , and bad movies , but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at . i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity , and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger ( 29 year-old ) teri hatcher nude . rent this , if you must , but , wow , there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad

0	this is not the first interview that fra . junge has given . view the sensational 1974 documentary , `` the world at war , ' narrated by lord laurence olivier , and you will see a much younger junge musing over her tenure with hitler . most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in `` the world at war . '' the 1974 documentary is filled with footage of hitler . having had relatives who were in germany at the time , and personally knowing former german soldiers and officers , i find it difficult to believe that junge did not know of the nazi death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on . i believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by hitler , perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors . my mother personally met hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace . at any rate , `` blind spot '' repeats `` the world at war '' interviews , and is a `` talking head '' that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over . the three stars is for effort , minus one star for `` nothing new '' and minus another star for german and not english ( english sub-titles ) . the younger frau spoke good english in 1974 but is lost in `` blind spot .

1	this movie was much better than i expected . with all the nonsense about the `` nc-17 '' rating wooooo , i thought it was gon na be all t and more . not that i do n't like that , but the movie was exactly what siskel ebert were saying at the time : a movie that has a plot and sexuality . not porn , but a truly adult movie . this is a movie that deals with grown up issues regarding sexuality , marriage and fidelity . those who are to immature or whose sense of morality forbids them from whatching a movie about two adults having extramarital and love affairs , definately will be offended and should avoid this movie . if you can watch something like that with an open mind and are interested in such a story line or you are interested in a love story that gets a little complicated and convoluted then this is for you . i am a big fan of uma thurman and that only makes this movie better for me . the story gets a bit complicated as the lovers grow in different directions . this is a very `` artsy '' movie . it deals with comlex love and sex issues . this by the way , was the first nc-17 movie . yes , they made that rating especially for this one , but its not anywhere as hot as showgirls as far as nudity . ( see my review of that one ) i was expecially surprised to find out that this is a true story about famous people . i loved it and i give henry june 5 stars

0	this is not a good tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination . the worse thing about the film is the horrible , unconvincing special-effects ! the scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking `` it 's coming closer !

'' scenarios , and astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such as soylent green , the omega man , the andromeda strain , westworld , and others . while the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of logan 's run are pretty cheesy , it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today 's botox era than they were in the 70 's . i have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original . unfortunately , given the recent history of hollywood , it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story , and replace it with more explosions , and perhaps will smith .
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes . this one happens to be only 18 minutes . this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle . even though it only cost me $ 2 i still got jipped . let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway . be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
1	can watching paint dry be riveting , interesting , and compelling ? can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic ? is it possible to watch the movie where an artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work ? jacques rivette 's `` le belle noiseuse '' is certainly not for every taste but i found it immensely rewarding . it is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension , uncertainty , selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model 's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion , technical excellence , and tremendous acting . michel piccoli as an aging painter edouard frenhofer , once famous and productive , jane birkin ( liz ) - his much younger wife and a former favorite model , and emmanuelle béart as marianne , the young , bright , and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened frenhofer from semi-lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable . the film also explores a vital for any artist subject - what is more important , the process of creating a work of art or the result ?
0	actually , since a couple of the yuen brothers did the choreography for this movie , it is n't really ripped off . corey yuen kwai did the action for 'buddha assassinator ' and there is some sleeping style in this movie also , but i will get to the action in a minute . stephen chow plays the king of beggars . once a rich young man and great in kung fu , he gets cheated out of everything he should have had by a government official . he is now forced to become a beggar with his father . the main problem is that the movie just does n't flow together very well . there is just too much beggar talk . the story does n't move along at all except at the start and end . the rest is just mindless talking . this starts out like a kung fu movie , but when chow becomes a beggar , that becomes the main focus of the story . the action is very good when it does happen and i loved the sleeping style . sleeping style has been used in a few older movies and it was nice to finally see it in a newer one , but they could have used it more . the undercranking is way too fast but the fights are still pretty good . 2.5/
0	note : if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this . ( i 'm giving you fair warning now , so do n't complain about spoilers later ) . the only reason i 'm mentioning the ending and the `` big secret '' is because i 'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment i experienced when watching this movie . when i first walked into the theatre to see this , i could n't have been more excited ; after months of waiting , i 'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time i saw it ! the movie started out wonderfully : great acting , scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds , and , at times , almost unbearable suspense ( that shyamalan really knows how to scare ! ) the story takes place in a small town in the 1800 's . at first this town seems like the perfect place to live : the people are friendly , the houses are cozy , and the scenery is beautiful . despite the peaceful setting , however , we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community , something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from being completely at ease . every now and then , they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village ; nobody ever ventures into it , and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it . pretty soon , we find out why : according to the village elders , there are dangerous , hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain . these creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village ( it attracts them ) . for years , the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding : as long as the villagers stay out of the forest , the monsters will not harm them . at one point , however , one of the creatures enters the village at night , leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack . while all this is happening , we ( the audience ) still do n't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are . it was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end : there are no monsters in the woods . when one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words `` it 's all a farce '' , i still could n't believe what i was hearing ; it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre ! after months of anticipating this film , of expecting a truly scary thriller , and of trying to guess what the monsters really are , there are no monsters ! disappointed does n't even begin to describe it . it got worse , though . the next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the `` monsters '' . the villagers are n't really living in the 1840 's ; they 're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve . supposedly , the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people , but when tragedy struck their families , they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new ( if extremely delusional ) life . the story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth . they even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real ! when the retarded boy died in the woods ( still wearing the stupid costume ) , the leaders , rather than mourning him , remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures . i basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them . what parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that ? i do n't think i 've ever been this disappointed in a movie before ; not only was it completely misleading , but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic ( i 'm sorry , but i have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it ) . many fans of this movie have said that those of us who did n't like it `` do n't get it '' . i assure you , i did get it , and i did n't like it anyway . i 'm no fan of slasher films and i did n't expect this to be one , but i also do n't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters . the two stars are for the cast and the filming . better luck next time , guys
0	have n't read the book , so ca n't compare , but the relic on film is simply pathetic . yes , it 's a monster movie . the problem is , this movie is no better than most of its genre , and worse than some . the monster looks like a refugee from one of the star wars episodes . the acting and dialogue are terrible . what a yawner !
1	i was about to buy the dvd since i found it in a store near home . i am glad i read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the dvd ... and that the poor reviews get deleted ( the ones about sound quality , that is ) . this is one of my favorite movies and i 'd really like to have a copy . i wish there were far more foreign films in this site . there 's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around..
1	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain . the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on . to top it up , the soundtrack on this movie is trully great . the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer . having seen quite a few criterions , i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one . i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever `` raw '' material they had available
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention . this is not the book , this is the vhs movie section . i see many book reviews , but not a single movie review . i 'm glad everyone liked the book , but we need to see if the movie is any good here . i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book , but i have seen some movies do a terrible job . what about this vhs movie ? has anyone actually seen it ? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price . used rental copies for $ 22 to 125 is outrageous . one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money
0	back in the early 90 's , jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover . granted , the role did n't give her much to work with , but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers , including me . the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career . unfortunately , choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had . i 've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre . most of the ones that i 've seen , while sexually explicit , are n't really erotic . nor are they thrilling in any way . this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar . as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver , jade , body of evidence and this film , color of night . the plot goes something like this . bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window , going splat on the sidewalk below . he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red ( ! ) . he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott 's therapy group . he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened . scott 's group is a motley crew of screwed up people , from a woman who is nymphomaniac , to a weird androgynous young boy . bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her . we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool , the bedroom , the bathtub and the shower . meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce . he tries to figure out if it 's someone in scott 's therapy group and on and on and so forth . the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie . virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances , but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender . add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension , and add way too many red herrings , and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch . about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit , but decidedly unerotic sex scenes . they really come across as more silly than anything else . the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever . what a smoking body ! but , like i mentioned before , she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result , she has appeared in very few movies since . i still think that if she had been given the proper chance , she could have been a great actress , but people have all but forgotten about her by now . it 's really surprising that this movie did n't kill bruce willis ' career . but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities , he could survive anything . btw , the version i watched was listed as being the `` r-rated director 's cut '' with 17 additional `` steamy '' minutes added back into the film . since i never saw the original cut i could n't tell what might have been added back into this version . there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that 's too strong . avoid this movie like it was herpes . color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content , nudity , graphic violence and strong language .
0	when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black , white and jittery gray , the result had better be good . that fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money , push play alongside mr. benefit-of-a-doubt and strain to see if it works . thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically , that of color . the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that , despite some grand intention , do not work , or , in the alternative , do not work as well . citing two examples - sin city which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white , tantamount to robbery , and good night america which is all and about the same . the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together , there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point , one might be better served as a charcoal artist . color is the medium of life . from a budgetary perspective , black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color , which , in a good feature , can be excessive , are thus eliminated . yet complications arise - for instance - i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand . similarly , the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink , in shades of course , and we would never know . yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it ? one wonders , however , that , if pi production would have had more money , would they have opted for color ? moot point . it 's done . notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do , pi , although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work , clever symbolism and high-octane guts , seems to lanquish for other reasons . despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout , spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves , after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost . as as result , the movie stays earthbound , weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline ( obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind ) , unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there , failing repetitive effect and thin , uninspiring 2-d support cast , leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay . unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive . despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won . the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second , belly down the next . as a fine creative exercise , the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in . contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off - `` a beautiful mind ''
1	i purchased this dvd for my very passionate son 's 11th birthday . when he opened it his eyes filled with tears . he has loved gorillas , chimps , and all primates since he was very young . i watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to digit 's murder . it was as i expected , he cried in my arms . his dream is to grow up and move to africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species . the movie was given to him for encouragment from ms. fossey with all her beliefs and struggles . we as the human race have a responsibility for all species on earth . this movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death . what strikes me about mrs. weaver is that she was also touched by fossey 's accomplishments and she is an honorary chair person for the dian fossey gorilla international fund . dian fossey wrote this passage in her journal , `` when you realize the value of all life , you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future . '' i hope this review helps you decide whether to buy the movie or not and brings at least one more person to acknowledge we must all do our part .
0	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame . he 's going home only cause he wants a car , shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas . they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season
1	i do n't have television , have n't for 11 years . when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi , csi ny , csi miami , and ncis . i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far . i enjoy the light-heartedness of ncis . so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox . i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased . as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer . when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way . i like selecting individual shows
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn
0	i do n't understand what the people in charge of producing `` the wiz '' as a film , could get by joining the former `` big '' names of diana ross , michael jackson , richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture . the music soundtrack is by far , much better than the movie itself . i have lately become a great soul music fan , so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work , not keeping in mind that it 's a `` movie soundtrack '' . in such manner you will enjoy it more !
0	a poorly-conceived , poorly put together mess . do n't bother
0	this film was probably made not to entertain the audience , but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on bosnia . but it does so for a small part only , showing the bosniaks and serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion . with the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists . its attempt to blind the viewer , hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper , is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality , but also through poor cinematografic form . the dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie . handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss . the handling shows several onlogical moments . and as a concept of `` we all suffered and we serbs did not start the war '' it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing . this movie does not entertain at all , and shows the events as unrealistic as any b - movie about vietnamwar . and about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in serbia . my rating is absolutely thumb down . comparing with , for example , no man 's land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former yugoslavia . instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war , you can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie
0	let 's face it . nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie 's viewing audience one way or the other . those who love j.lo will declare the greathess of this movie , in a variety of ways . those who hate j.lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is . and those who love quality film wo n't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists . guilty pleasure , indeed ! one thing you have to admit about j.lo , she 's consistent . she sings bad , acts bad , and is merely eye candy , for thoe who find her appealing . and this movie is full of all of the above , plus awful , cliche ridden , emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with hollywood writing aspirations , since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes . at least it 's had it 's short , but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels , cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous , just like the lead starlett . maniupulative only begins to describe this drek . but that said , it 's more than enough time wasted on this movie . i merely felt compelled to warn folks . do n't waste your time . it stinks
0	in case you 're wondering , the aforementioned 'suckers ' are anybody who paid to see this movie..and i dont mean just in a theater ... i count myself in because it cost me $ 3.79 at my video store ! looking back , i should have given that money to a homeless person , then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would have gotten the same effect of watching this pretentious piece of garbage ! this guy sucks ! ! seriously , his talent level should place him as a writer for the sci-fi channel ... maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes ? ? ..but he is in over his head when it comes to big-budget movies ... and where the f did the budget go ? has the the price of 'monster suits ' ( signs anyone ? ) increased to the multimillion dollar range ? my guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who 's agents suckered them into this sham of a film . if you read the 'quotes n trivia ' on amazon 's link you will find that ( a ) kirsten dunst bailed out on this sinking ship ( good thinking girl ) and ( b ) sigourney weaver had nightmares after she read the script ... obviously she had already committed.. spoiler ... . short summary of the incredibly unfeasible plot : a bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve ( although we see no animals in it ) , undetected by authorites , long enough to raise children , whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks . anyone ever seen a scooby-doo episode ? then 1 guy stabs another and they send a blind girl ( with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately ) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest ( how she is supposed to acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine is up to her ) ..but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park ! and the cult lives on ... seriously..thats the plot . i 've read that he stole this plot from the book 'running out of time ' ... not to mention the scooby-doo thing , or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock ... this guy is a hack folks
1	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story . it was very imaginative and well acted . the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well . the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie . other than that , if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you
0	oh please - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette ' do so and make it available on dvd . this was one of the finest shows ever created for television . truly , it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now , 40+ years later , i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd . for the sake of one of the theater ( and humanity 's ) most glorious theatrical efforts , please make the original tv version available ! ( btw - i rate the original item at 5+ stars !

0	do n't know about anyone else , but the dvd i purchased had lousy video . the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots . all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either . i know the concert was indoors , but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem . did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem
0	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn
1	i think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do : are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things to the viewer ) , or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction ( which the viewer can then accept or reject ) ? martin sheen is kit , a garbageman working in south dakota ; he becomes friends with 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he does n't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . the two run off together , living for a while in the woods like two `` innocents '' of some primitive society . but then they 're discovered by three men and sheen kills them , too . they now head for montana , sheen committing more murders along the way . he is empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he 's like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he does n't have a clue what he should be alienated against , and as far as being misunderstood , he never once gives the least hint there is anything there to understand . we finish watching the movie feeling as empty as sheen . i also felt a little angry at malick 's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to sheen 's vapid character than there really is : he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people . so back to my first paragraph . malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed ( a view that became an obsession , i think , with artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning in the late 1960s ) ; i tend toward believing the second half . suum cuique
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro . then i re-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file , but it again it only had sound and not video . this one is a waste of money
0	this title is the bootleg title for a film called the the ratings game . i 'm no sure why amazon is selling this on their web site . the quality of this dvd is terrible , i was suspicious when i got it . the dvd case and the dvd itself look like they were home made . having said all this , knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it . it 's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time . i expected more of danny devito .
1	grand old movie , well acted , will watch many times agai
0	this film was dreadful . streisand is absolutely unlikeable . to enjoy this film , you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible . i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was . along with the english patient , this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed ' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing
1	russians and yankees team up to save the world in `` meteor '' , one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s ' . ( like the `` airport '' movies - you 'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster . ) in `` meteor '' , a huge chunk of an asteroid , blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet , is now heading towards earth . called `` orpheus '' , the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival . the only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by nasa and the soviet union - each pointed at targets on earth rather than into space . ( i do n't remember if the platforms , named for hercules and `` peter the great '' actually violated any treaties , but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret . ) the americans learn of the incoming asteroid first , having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet 's collision . they then learn that hercules is `` light '' -they 'll need extra missiles , and since they do n't have any time to put new ones into space ( and as henry fonda 's president puts it memorably , they ca n't just `` conjure some out of thin air '' ) they 'll have to go to the russians for help . waiting for orpheus to hit , the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from earth , and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller `` splinters '' . ( in an interesting move , there are n't any subtitles for the international targets . ) even if you find the special effects lame , the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor , `` meteor '' surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars . sean connery is great in a post-bond role as the civilian designer of hercules - a nasa fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ( `` hercules '' was apparently designed just for this eventuality ) . brian keith is also great as dubov , connery 's russian counterpart . the script has most of the yankees getting along with the russians , so he 's never a foil for connery , but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged soviet , improbably speaking all his lines in russian . karl malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a nasa bureaucrat - he 's neither scientist , engineer or politician , but he keeps connery 's maverick in line . landau , a great actor , plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the russians more than shooting stars . the fx are actually pretty good for pre-cgi ( mostly excelling in the space sequences ) . the music seems repetitive , but laurence rosenthal 's score is also evocative of the russians and the oncoming asteroid . much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant . ( did they need all of the `` splinter '' scenes ? the `` avalanche '' sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end , but there 's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence . ) that said , the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable , and the plusses make it worth watching . the script places the control center for hercules underneath the old at bulding in tribeca , and i admit i ca n't pass the place without thinking of this movie
0	this movie was awful . that 's all i can say about it . it killed the book , which happens to be one of my favorites . when i got this movie after reading the book , i excitedly stuck it in my vcr ( yes , vcr -- no affordable dvd players at the time ) , i was expecting so much more than what i received . i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into 2-hours , but i 've never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now , that 's just ridiculous ! if i were the author , david baldacci , i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered . clint eastwood had to be the star , so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero , when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half-way though . in the movie , the book 's hero jack graham is totally non-existent . my advice to you if you 're looking to buy a good movie : look someplace else . read the book . *sigh* if only the movie would 've followed the book a little more closely ... it might have been a blockbuster hit . too bad .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
0	first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan ; therefore , i tried to like this . really , i did . sadly , this film stinks . the focus is not on the bands themselves , but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson . what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life . maybe i 'm not british , but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny . only a few scenes made me grin . the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film . in addition , the camera work was very jerky . looked like it was done by a novice ( and yes , i 'm one myself , having made two movies ) the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division . too bad the members of this band are minor characters . i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much , much better
0	after watching this lame , stupid sequel all i can say is `` leave it alone already ! '' god this film sucked . first , after 25 years of trying to escape from brother michael , this is how laurie strode goes out ? ? ? ! ! ! major let down , it should have been more shocking and spectacular . second , while `` 20 years later/halloween 7 '' was made for lifetime , this one seems to have been made for mtv . all dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for part 6 , is give it style , no substance whatsoever . the only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6 , fully due to bringing back the guy who played michael in 4 ( the last good halloween film ) george wilbur , he 's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now . third , i 'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with busta rhymes and tyra banks . no talent busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut . they suck . hopefully hollywood feels the same way since i have n't seen them in anything since , thank god . fourth , the story is just another retread with a new gimmick , the internet web cam . poorly executed , no suspense at all in this film . the film was originally suppossed to be released for halloween '01 , but they had to do reshoots to improve the film , unsuccessfully i might add , so it was released in summer '02 . funny , this film was directed by the same guy who directed `` halloween ii '' ( the best sequel ) . even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well , but john carpenter did them and it did improve the film . his touch is sorely missed here . so , if dreadful acting ( except jaime lee curtis , but she 's only in the first 10 minutes , unfortunately ) , boring , dumb story and dialogue , shockless , routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense ( unless your 10 years old and have never seen a horror film ) if all that 's your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time , money effort ( if there was any ) . it 's just another insult to fans of the original . and now , for next halloween ( '07 ) we will get `` halloween : the remake '' directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic ( not ! ! ! ) `` house of 1000 corpses '' , rob zombie ! i 'm also sick of bad singers thinking they can direct . the choice is refective of hollywood nowadays , style over substance , cool and trendy over timeless and great .
0	i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone
0	i am bewildered at the praise and adoration that is heaped on this terrible movie . to give an adequate measure of just how bad this movie is , it is only fair to review/describe it on several different levels . first , as mike judge films go , this is the bottom of the barrel . office space was hilarious in its simplicity , where the subtle sarcasm and deadpan rips on pop culture were well-timed , sufficiently developed , and acted out with talent . in idiocracy , the jabs at society and our 'dumbed-down culture ' ( regardless of how appropriate and accurate ) are a dime a dozen , with the vast majority of them falling way short of genuinely entertaining humor . i actually appreciate and am amused by the subject matter and the setting , but beyond that , this movie leave a lot to be desired . secondly , as comedies go in general , this movie stinks . i realize that judge wanted to , on some level , create a commentary on the self-destructive path that our culture is on , and i 'll even admit that the first 15 minutes were very promising . wilson 's character is funny in the same way as livingston 's character in office space ... he is a subtle simpleton who relishes in his blissful ignorance and laziness . however , beginning with the introduction of rudolph 's character , the movie begins its downhill plunge . she is not only not funny , she is downright annoying on screen . she over-acts in most of her scenes , leading most viewers in suspense as to when she 'll go away . her character , amongst countless others ( including dax shepard at his quasi-retarded worst and terry crews in a role that would make even the most avid randy savage fan cringe with his over-the-top-yet-still-not-believable machismo ) , is one of the weakest supporting characters i have ever seen . i found myself silently condemning the casting director throughout this movie ... not to mention counting down until it was over . i think that this is where judge 's latest offering falls [ way ] short : in office space , livingston is surrounded by an amalgam of genuine ( albeit nerdy ) characters who not only are tolerable , but in most scenes are actually as integral to the humor as the protagonist . wilson is talented , but even his drawling wit and everyman charm wear thin in this stinker . in addition , his agent should be shot for signing him onto this one without a better supporting cast . verdict : do n't waste your time . re-watch office space if you 're looking for some judge humor that actually elicits laughs
1	i absolutely love atlantis . from ronon dex , to sheppard , and to all the faces . i 'd cry if atlantis was cancelled . seriously though , steve should have never have died , he should also have been put in command of sg1 . can you imagine that ... '' why steve , welcome to earth ... you 're welcome to live out your life , if you only feed in self defense on enemies ... 'kay ? oh , you 're also in charge of sg1 . : p '' but seriously , the wraith make this show so awesome . from steve to bob to edward , to gordon and alexander , to michael and eric ( by far james 's best performance yet ) . the wraith make this show what it is . but one thing ? ? ? why do n't we have before i sleep ? seriously , you have no idea how irked i am at that , since i began watching in s.2.12 . anyways , i think atlantis totally pwns sg1
1	this is an hbo remake of the original 50 's 50 footer . naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era . however it still captures the thrills and chills . you may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever ( rats . ) nancy ( the little woman ) does not have quite the devoted husband . here life is not quite ideal . soon a chance encounter with aliens ( the space type ) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation . 50 foot bigger . now it is nancy 's turn for a little revenge . the ending is a little unnerving . be sure to see daryl in just as serious of a role in `` high spirits '' ( 1998 )
0	i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i ca n't believe how disappointed i am for this . i was expecting fireworks ; instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head . not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw . to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like 'what is the meaning ? ' then there 's the film 's signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera . again i said to myself , 'what 's the point ? ' and then there 's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory 's character getting shot in the head . in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because 'oswald realized that he was raymond shaw . ' if he 's right that raises the question : did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over ? then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of `` the manchurian candidate '' and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 's what it is and why people today ( including me ) are still obessed with that decade . in conclusion , i think this was a big disappoinment . and this movie is on the list of afi 's 100 greatest films ? please .
0	filmed in 1933 , this movie is in black and white , and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today 's standards . an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii , the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped , and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered . a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story , but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research
0	i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it , and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart , funny , and heartbreaking , without ever being sappy . so , naturally , i was curious about the movie too . i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too , not much could go wrong . and while the story line followed the book more or less , the movie turned out terrible . i could not have been more disappointed ! ! first of all , jack nicholson is completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( as usual ) , not the *interesting* guy that mark is supposed to be . he is the opposite of charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e . somebody that the character of the wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely . you suspect all along that he is a cad ; therefore , rachel 's utter shock at his betrayal does n't make sense . besides , he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy , but much better in her role as rachel . still , she ca n't carry the movie alone , and her love scenes with nicholson are flat ; there is no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel , and whether she really did write all the scenes . the wedding scene , where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing , while the wedding guests wait , is out of place , not to mention boring , not to mention heavy handed . a total dud
0	after two hours of watching it , i still do n't know what it was about . yes , the scenery is fantastic , but a national geographic film would have done more . i applaud the acting of milla jovovich , and nastassja kinski . but , the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie . i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd . as for wes bentley , that 's acting ? he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him , or a co-worker being blown to `` kingdom come '' ( that 's a pun based on the movie ) . he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier . the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book , but very loosely based , and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development . they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest .
1	dino made a number of westerns , everything from the comic western pardners with jerry lewis , to a whodunit western , five card stud with robert mitchum , to playing an alcoholic lawman in rio bravo . but martin had a field day playing the villain in rough night in jericho , a hard-bitten , violent movie . martin plays jason flood , an ex-lawman who has taken over the town of jericho . george peppard and john mcintire plays former lawmen as well , who have been contracted to provide a stage to jean simmons , who flood is trying to force into going into business with him . flood is also an ex of simmons , which makes him even more determined not to let peppard and mcintyre help her out . things get increasingly violent until the final showdown , where the blood flows freely . everyone is good in this film , fro mthe three leads to mcintire , who was always superb , particularly in westerns , as well as the great slim pickens as one of flood 's henchmen . rough night in jericho is overlooked , but it 's very entertaining
0	mortal kombat : annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it . from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters ( odd , considering that in interviews after the first movie , all of them said they 'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel ) , to the horrible ( even by 1997 standards ) cg effects , to the cliched fight scenes ( gee ... two women in a mud pit . i bet it took them all night to come up with that one ) , virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie . loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game ( and set immediately after the first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger ) , the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan ( played by brian thompson , the alien bounty hunter from the x-files ) and his army ( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras . oooh ... scary . ) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld . this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity . with only a week to do anything about it , lord raiden ( played by james remar , replacing the , and i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , much better christopher lambert in the role ) once again enlists the help of liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , and princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , along with help from a select few other characters from the video games ' crowded lineup , to prevent this from happening . the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad . however , given the film 's obviously low budget the weak screenplay , the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film , and most jarringly , direction even more inept than that of paul w.s . anderson , it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high , only to have practically everything come crashing down . the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack , featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie , as well as music by kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , and others . if ever you 're looking to punish yourself for something , then by all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself , you will avoid this movie like the plague . believe me , you 'll thank yourself later .
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
1	... then this would be a really serious detective . as it 's executed now , it 's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones . cool
1	easily one of the funniest movies ever made . its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar , and this year is the most galling of all , as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in `` the good earth '' ; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated ( after all , its only a comedy , right ? ) but this is a movie that will never age : it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back , and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago , the response would be the same . dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships , and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ( `` not oklahoma city itself ? ! '' ) . but it is irene dunne who is the star here , and until such time as `` theodora goes wild '' and `` show boat '' are finally released on dvd , this is the best of her 30s roles .
0	i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows . i 'm not , so i could n't tell you . mediocre at best . `` this is spinal tap '' was better
1	i really love bones . it has everything : suspense , drama , humor , pretty people , fun storylines . i have yet to miss an episode , and even into season 2 this is probably my favorite . it adds depth to all of the characters . also , the winter holidays are my favorite time of year . i like holidays that are about what is good in the world . bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day . i cry through half this episode , but in a completely good way . buy , watch it , love it . but watch it with a friend if you do n't want to cry alone . so moving , great performances by the whole cast . emily deschanel was powerful in this one , she brings real vulnerability to brennan here . david boreanaz , as always the perfect sympathetic hero , loveably old-fashioned . cute , funny moments . touching , poignant moments . this really is the best of what is great about bones
1	on a june evening in 1968 i was awakened by my dad , a marine raider and one of the chosen few , at ten o'clock pm , that 's 2200 , to watch the di ... five hours before i was to report to the armed forces induction center , oakland , calif . i wo n't ever forget that movie session with my dad , and as one other person commented , ya never forget your dis , mine were ssgt gonzales , ssgt rogers , and cpl sexton . great movie , jack webb is still the di , sorry r. lee , got ta go with tradition here ! sure would like to see this on dvd , but for now i 'll settle for the vhs ... i bought two copies , one for me and one for a friend ! semper fidelis to all the brothers and sisters ! pau
1	flesh and bone is an evocative , haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man ( played with understated , heartbreaking perfection by dennis quaid ) who encounters a lost soul ( meg ryan , outstanding ) leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up . plotted an as slow burning thriller , this is really more of a complex and intriguing character study of guilt , father-son ties , violent crime and doomed love . flesh and bone is a bleak but supremely well crafted film that reaches a truly sad ( though inevitable ) conclusion . the final moment between our two main characters is incredibly moving ( in a very unsentimental sort of way ) and a scene that i will never forget . i didnt mind the major plot twist as its no more unbelievable that a dozen of hollywood 's most praised suspense thrillers . the spare , atmospheric photography ( set in a desolate , bleak texas ) is exceptional and thomas newman 's suberb score will get under your skin . for those who wont something altogether deeper , affecting and more emotionally satisfying with their thrillers ( or love stories ) , flesh and bone should be ripe for rediscovery .
1	what can i say if you like clint eastwood your going to like this movie . i have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in ! what memories
0	i reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the sinatra version in an earlier issue . how does the update stand up ? well , once they moved the setting to iraq , cleaned up the muddy surrealism , sobered up the star , and played it straight , there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message . like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake . or chinese cinema . `` we will tell you what to think . '' the locals might mistake it for a documentary . i quit watching after 30 minutes . you just ca n't carry an entire movie with a `` fake war hero via hypnosis '' plot . no movie should hinge on a single plot point , and if it does , please do n't make it a boring one . no disrespect to denzel washington intended . he played frank sinatra so well that co-producer tina sinatra probably got goosebumps . and what a waste of meryl streep . she did a great job and it did n't matter . but hey , one of the beauties of watching dvds in china is that i do n't blow three hours ' pay on each movie . as a brief aside , show one flew over the cuckoo 's nest to 155 chinese students . this film refuses to tell them what to think , and that confuses the hell out of them . then they ask you , mr . teacher person , to explain the film 's message . um , it 's about your school , but i 'm not saying that .
1	i grew up in australia with these rankin/bass christmas cartoons and i missed them when they were no longer shown . i can only say that the dvd 's are fantastic and the cartoons are exactly as i remember them .
0	this movie is so bad , it barely deserves mention . however , i am a big dl fan , and i am writing this in the hope that dolph will not abandon his fans -- -he may be making movies like this just for the $ $ , but , i believe , he is also doing irreparable damage to his career
1	it is truly a pity that the western has died off . they are rare and far between these days . a few years back tom selleck and sam elliot made a few together and separate . they are all worth seeing . this one has tom playing cable , a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the south has lost . it just has n't been declared yet . his family and friends thought him to be dead , and the reunion seems a bit shaky . his wife played by suzy amis , is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business . eventually she works things out with her husband cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun . even though cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them . when he is accused of murdering a retired union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice . the production values are excellent and the acting , directing , sets , and music are all top drawer . good dvd quality but no extras . if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining . if you like it be sure to see `` crossfire trail '' and `` conagher ''
0	oh the humanity ! ... first , the obvious : tara reid as cybill ? i do n't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor , but it is a mystery how that happened . secondly , dominique swain just did n't act like the andrea marr of the book . it seemed like dominique swain did n't even read the book before she played andrea . i also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around , but that 's another topic . the movie did n't have any similarities with the `` feeling '' of the book , even though the plot was ( roughly ) similar . portia derossi as carla ? ummmm ... . maybe ? selma blair as darcy sort of worked . the only character i felt was well-cast was todd sparrow . anyhow , i re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie , to try to recapture the feel of the book ( and erase the memory of the movie )
0	if you got elvis presley and dodie marshall and put them in the same film you will have easy come easy go , an elvis presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love . but anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an elvis presley fan will be un-happy . and elvis ' leading lady in this film is dodie marshall which i guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947 . and this is one of final films that elvis sings the same song with somebody else , and the song is yoga is as yoga goes . he sings that with elsa lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher . if you are an elvis presley fan , then buy or rent jailhouse rock on video or dvd
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website . yeah , at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials , but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs

1	in the sequel to `` john carpenter 's vampires '' , derek bliss ( jon bon jovi , who takes james woods place ) is a professional vampire killer who has been assigned to terminate the vampire queen in mexico uma ( arly jover ) . along the way he assembles what terns out to be the most montley of crews in vampire hunting history . zoey ( natasha wagner ) , a girl who is strung out on vamp blood . a priest who has n't quiet taken his vows yet . and last but not least a black redneck mercenaery . guys , this is what it is . actually it is n't too bad . bon jovi is not the world 's greatest thespian ( his antics in concert are amazing though ) . do n't quit your day job , jon . but he still has a certain charm thaat gets you through the film 's rough spots . arly jover was cast because she looks good naked , period . this is a low budget film , but vet horror director tommy lee wallace knows how to make it streach and give us a good time . just do n't be looking for high atr
0	i like japanese films , and really wanted to like this one . however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot . now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day . if that is true i might give it a higher rating . as of now however , there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense
0	for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up . i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released . it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office . if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up . i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either . i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his/her mistake . this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs . wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich ? do we wait until then to change the moral ? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
1	oh yeah ! this is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre . the big doll house has everything you could possibly need if you are wip junkie : cat fights ( one even takes place in the mud ) , group showers , sadistic guards , scantically clothed gun toting babes , lesbianism , torture , and pam grier . oh yeah !
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories . the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin . both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting . so this thing ends and the movie should have also . it should have been a 30 minute movie . so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs . wow , what a movie . the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day . she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie .
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon . it will only play on their downloaded player ... wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television . do n't bother buying this ... just go for the trek collection on dvd
1	while i recently called `` ballad of cable hogue '' my favorite sam peckinpah movie , this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best , and imho one of the best of the 1970s . for those who havent seen it , the setup is the daughter of ( presumably ) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia ; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo , and down on his luck bum warren oates ( think a seedier version of bogart in `` sierra madre '' ) is hired by a pair of `` entrepeneurs '' ( gig young and robert webber ) to do the dirty work . the irony : alfredo is already dead in a car accident . and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge , justice , betrayals , love , -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat . oates was always an underappreciated actor , but here he gives his best performance , matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend . not a movie you want to watch frequently , but it is a masterpiece .
1	i wo n't lie . this movie sucks . however , it is so cheesy and lame that it will make you wet your pants . i do n't care what people say , but i like the no-name actors and the wanna-be power ranger ninjas . it is a great movie because it is the worst movie ever . also , i must add that the action was utterly stupid and the acting was absolutely pathetic . : ) great movie , though . yes , i will agree , the plot sucks . however , there is no plot , therefor the movie rocks . buy it now and own the best movie ever for two bucks used and new . it 's the corniest and cheesiest movie ever ! :
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first . though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch , the episode cuts off after 22 minutes . obviously , i already know the ending of `` the black death '' , but i still wanted to see the full show
1	i wanted it for my collection , however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work
1	i have loved this movie since seeing it upon its ' initial theatrical release . many sleepless nights ( and views ) later , i was able to begin to make some sense out what jacob singer was going through . as listed in the other reviews , this is not a movie for the 'casual ' film-watcher , as it requires the viewers ' full attention . the imagery is amazingly suggestive without being overt , and is one of my favorite elements -- -what you 'think ' you see may sometimes be more psychologically terrifying than what you actually see ... but , this is not a horror film in the strictest sense , although it is horrifying , considering what jacob singer experiences . i am amazed , even here in 2007 how well this movie holds up in story , cinematography , acting , and general flow . it works itself into your brain and sets off a bomb inside , making you `` live '' through the mind of the protagonist , feeling his `` ascension '' ... if you 've not seen this movie , then you 've missed a real treat , but prepare yourself -- -do n't watch it until you 're mentally prepared , and certainly do n't watch it if you 're depressed already -- -this ai n't no `` feel good '' , `` happy times '' movie ... and , if you 've not seen it in several years , then watch it again and take your own climb ... or descent ? ? ?
0	this movie was awfull . supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better , so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
1	i have owned the video for several years and just purchased the dvd . hannah and her sisters far exceeds anne hall as my favorite allen picture . such a joy . and the dvd is wonderful
1	i seen it a few months back then , to my dismay it was on again the same time as raw , but instead i recorded it anyways . it does a very good job of creating a nightmare orwellian future , without making the people seem too paranoid for the most part . the scenes of the president talking on tv were very powerful . it strongly reminded one of a `` big brother lite . '' yes there is violence and a love story and rebels risking their lives for a better future . some favorite moments : 1 . the girls running out of the clinic 2 . the guard and dog patrolling the quarantine 3 . the rebel leader screaming for guards there was a negative present ( which is punishable by getting shot on the premises ) 4 . the extremely moving ending and the new rebel leader awesome flick you do n't wan na miss , trust me .
0	dear film company jackasses , surely you know we already hate you for your greed - why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like `` the great santini '' and cutting them to full screen ? yet another fine film marred , no doubt , by some big company 's desire to cut corners . burn , hollywood , burn

1	dvd newcomer `` fort apache '' ( 1948 ) looks great , with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images ( from original nitrate elements ) and bugle-brisk audio . the film , ironically , finds henry fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against john wayne 's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice . the ( single ) dvd has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film , a shame . it does include a 15-minute piece on monument valley , covering ford 's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the indian reservation 's history . the navajo , paid good wages for their appearances , called him `` giant soldier . '' `` i 've kissed more babies than a politician , '' ford said . `` part of his vision of the world was that we 're all very small in the scheme of things , '' film historian joseph mcbride says . `` i think ( monument valley ) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along .

1	dexter gordon is dale turner , an ex-patriot jazz musician living in paris and playing nightly at the blue note . ( his character is based loosely on lester young and bud powell , but mainly it is all dexter . ) a young frenchman ( francois cluzet ) idolizes him and later befriends him . dex has problems , mainly booze , and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink . the cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who 's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is , of course , the main focus of the film . ( that this is the only way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform . but it sells . ) dex gets homesick for new york , returns , falls into his old habits , misses the flight back to paris , and soon dies . the movie is overly long , but gordon is mesmerizing . dexter speaks slowly , as if from behind a veil ( gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in mexico when he agreed to do the movie ) ; he had much input on the film , creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy . the picture has faults , to be sure , but it 's a mighty achievement nonetheless . the music , of which there is plenty , is , of course , top-notch

1	prior to watching this , i expected something on par with `` striptease '' or `` showgirls , '' which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots . even with earnest intentions , films of this sort usually end up being clichéd and disappointing . adding to my trepidation was the fact i had never heard of this film , which was released in 2000 , prior to 2006 . i finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters . like most people , these women only want to find love and something real in life , yet have lost their centers . indeed , it is the actresses ' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch . sandra oh really moved me with her performance as jasmine , a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she can not trust anyone , including herself . her performance as a sensitive , intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation , even though she easily could . as angel , darryl hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer . ( she also looks unbelievably fit ! ) jennifer tilly is also very good as the out of control jo , a woman who tries desperately to win in a man 's world , but comes to realize the playing field is not level . charlotte ayanna is remarkable as jessie , an eager to please naïf , who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world . come to think of it , it does all sound very clichéd and there really is n't much of a plot to tie it all together , just several subplots . nonetheless , the acting is exceptional , made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised . ( and yes , the ladies here all smoke , which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances ) i enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot . the dvd is quite decent , with a very good transfer , optional subtitles and some alternate scenes . this is a bargain for the price .

1	the characters are likable , there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film , but only about half of the scenes are necessary . it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky . gene is a funny guy , there is no doubt about that , but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly , except for a few instances of harsh language and violence , but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days . it is worth a look , but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story

0	i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first . this movie is boring and did no justice to the book
0	this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in 96 ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .

1	words can not express how glad i am the adventures in motion pictures company made available matthew bourne 's swan lake on dvd . the cliché thing to say is it 's `` amazing '' , `` genius '' , `` sexy '' , `` masterful '' ... but it is all those things and more . you 've never see anything like this . to me this `` modern '' swan lake is now the definitive classic of a classic -- i ca n't nor do i want to imagine the swan roles as anything but manly now . the leads adam cooper and scott ambler are not only great dancers , they are great actors . their chemistry is enjoyable to behold -- and just as believable as the chemistry the traditional swan lake man/woman pair conveys . in fact , a male swan is more provocative *because* it 's not the typical sad , delicate princess from all other versions . instead we see something new and wonderful -- a true creature of beauty , power and majesty who utterly captivates the prince ( and the audience ) in every way . the male duets and solos in this show are just ... wow . i brought this dvd to my best friend 's house and i was unsure what she would think , she 'd never seen any ballet let alone one so un-traditional as this . my fears were put to rest in act ii . once the swan appeared she did n't take her eyes away the rest of the night . we both watched in silence as if mesmerized . it was a fantasitc feeling to watch it with someone else and see them be amazed . the music helped too , swan lake has by far some of the best music ever written for the stage . surely many people who are n't normally ballet watchers would appreciate this show -- its humor , universal themes of forbidden love , the unique way the swans look and act like real birds , and above all else powerful manly dancing -- definitely something for everyone ! share this with someone you love , quick ! !
1	this episode is a classic , and is one of the best in the series . it explores time travel and alternate time lines , and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed .
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars . i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy . there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging . it looks like a bad vhs transfer . i should have returned it , but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth . i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately , in my case , i have to add : buyer beware .

1	darkness ( for those who wonder what the title film means ) is not the only time of the day tenebre 's would-be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best-selling author 's latest creation . before you can even say what the -- , this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair . never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast . with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer-score to boost , tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must-see . undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento 's career. -- -- -martin bouche
1	a very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love , happiness and meaning . the film takes place on new year 's eve , 1981 , and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party ( which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through . ) elvis costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third . the soundtrack is great -- all late 70 's early 80 's pop and new wave . and the one who steals the show is dave chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point , dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way , on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to `` get booty . '' ( smiling at a girl is very important , as is avoiding talking about death -- '' everyone knows they 're gon na die someday , they just do n't want to hear it from you . '' ) ben affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor . oh , and courtney love was actually bearable . all in all , a very smart , enjoyable ride
1	eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate . conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness . it is also horrific to watch . i had heard the parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the president 's right ear . they should know , they were there right ? the film shows otherwise . if there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret , show me someone who can keep a secret . if the us government is hiding evidence why is this footage available ? no one can tell where a shot came from by the target 's movement . the answer to where jfk 's missing brain is here , the third shot pulverized it , turning it into a red mist . had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage . this is history which can not be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads . see for yourself

0	the first half if they had made movies back then , in 1871 , it would move as slowly as this . perhaps that date suits the film to perfection . the days of utter simplicity , with nearly nothing happening . where maybe days are filled with yourself . not distractions . after half an hour , all i could think was , if this was on tv , not only would everybody switch off , the sh** ( show ) would be axed . it may even beat so many foregin movies as the slowest movie of all time . but slow really means empty . the other half ( of me ) yet i have since come to learn , by others ' reviews , this is a movie which you must make , by the mood , or the feeling of dread others speak of . or else you are left with the feeling of dead . i failed to do that , and without that , the film fails miserably i reckon . perhaps because i am dead . so , therefore , i envy those creative creatures of subtle senses . or whether it was because they were so simple , or easily pleased , which means more modest , more modern . so , as in real life , it 's only the feeling which makes anything real . my first ( or worst ? ) half the other part of me thought that , the film being a feature length , they think they can just not try for half an hour , an hour . such is the problem with many filmakers , even today . when , being a torture , err feature , they should try much harder ! ! therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire . virtually nothing happens , and what does makes little sense , as any unconcious creation . my better half of the schizophrenic but the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine , and not being stereotype ; is pleasingly real . weird as suits the role . as are the others natural , with no hollywood posing . how often have i heard that story - good acting , bad film ? oh i 'm sorry , i did it again . the only thing exciting is the title . the whole my conclusion is : i do n't know which is my better half , and which is my worst half . . . ? so , all things being unequal , i choose both . i stand and fall by both my views . ( i guess that 's why god gave us 2 eyes . ) i was going to give it only one star* at first , but now i give it merely two** , knowing i 'm still mean . i see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one 's temperament . if you feel better than me , are supernaturally sensitive , or have the patience of a saint to me , add one , two , or three more stars respectively . i intend to watch it again , and then maybe i can give a before and after shot . please feel free to reject me , write negative comments about me , or scare me . or kill me .

0	i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular . it kept me awake but just on the verge . the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie . i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best . overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star .
0	sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.i 'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.nothing is moving , action is zero and filming is poor . we are very far away from dirty dozen , battle of the bulge , midway , enemy below etc ... . a total waste of time and money
0	i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen . we 're still friends , but i 'll never listen to one of his reviews again -- our taste must not be compatible . my wife , daughter , and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we 've ever seen . it 's the only movie i 've ever turned off before the end . on the plus side , watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema . i used to think i knew bad movies . now i know that most movies are at least pretty good , and it 's only a very few that are truly bad . this is one of those very few bad films . best in show belongs to a genre of `` comedies '' that i find boring at best , but often cruel and mean . other films of this type are `` waiting for guffman '' , `` bottle rocket '' , etc . if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you 'll appreciate this movie
0	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse , worst of the worst abc afterschool specials . if you had not read the book , you would be unable to follow what was happening . some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time . the original evil dead , with all its flaws , is a better put together film than this one . this movie is flat-out painful to watch . you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do . it all seems so random . read the book . if you see this movie in a rental store , just move along , please , nothing to see here
0	i have friends who might be into this stuff , if only because they like the old and the strange . me , i 'm just like -- is this `` it 's a wonderful life '' ? i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script . as it is , this just barely seems to translate into a movie , and -- forgive me for i have my own opinion -- '' city of angels '' was a good movie . too bad if you do n't like all this `` contemporary nonsense . '' i feel like it worked . my opinion : it 's long , it 's boring , it 's hard to hear . even if it has a message , i just ca n't relate to it . so maybe that 's my problem . your opinion : your own . keep it . you 're lucky i gave it two stars
1	i can not believe how mean and down-dirty elections can get when they get too close . does it tell us something about the election process . it needs to become kinder . democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it . it can be done ! it would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right ... the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it , like it was pushing an agenda . good awareness piece though .
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach . here we have a woman like nora ephron , a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries , she turns into a needy , desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies , one after another . i ususally love all of meryl 's movies , but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy , always pregnant `` homemaker '' . if i were a man , i would have run awary screaming , too
0	i love nature and cowboy movies . jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen . it is unforgetable . it was my favorite robertredford movie . he did very little talking talking in this movie , he just acted , his best performance ever . the movie deals with the american indian also , in a profound and touching way . this movie is engrossing and based on a true story , it 's simply the best . do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie , it is a classic . it truly is in a league of it 's own .
0	three years after the first mortal kombat film , fans could n't wait for annihilation to come out . unfortunately , the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it , i can see why . first , i will start with what is positive about the movie . kitana had more of a role as did jax , i preferred sandra hess as sonya a little over bridget wilson even though she did a good job with sonya 's character in the first movie , some of the fight scenes ( jax vs. cyrax , sonya vs. mileena , liu kang vs. baraka , sub-zero vs. scorpion ) were sequenced good , the dvd bonus features were nice , and the soundtrack was awesome . these positive aspects , however , could not save the overall film from disappointment . so what went wrong ? like the first mk , annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie ( mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3 ) . unlike the first mk , however , the blend was not successful . too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent . aside from that , only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return . what else went wrong with this sequel ? some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful . shao kahn 's character along with raiden 's character was poorly resembled . also , some of the characters did n't even get much screen time at all . one flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off ( i wo n't say who because it is probably obvious ) . while some of the fight sequences were good , most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous . this goes double for the animality sequence . sadly , mk annihilation does n't rank up with the first one . despite all this , there is some good news . after eight long years of waiting , a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie . plus , the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of annihilation
0	okay , so to catch up on this exciting new series , i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase . minutes later , i was watching the first episode , it came quickly , sounded great , and looked wonderful ... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end . forgiveable , until ... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video , making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing . but , this is a good concept ... unfortunately , amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so , until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds ... do not try and download season 1 , episodes 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ! ! ! 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , and 10 were the only ones that were 100 % complete for me
0	years after its release i find myself writting what i consider a completely biast review for this film ( being somewhat of a star wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before ) . let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film . for me , i grew up watching the original star wars ( now titled episode iv , a new hope ) . when the original star wars came out , it changed the way people looked at sci-fi . i saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets , props , costumes , etc . it was the best eye-candy of its time by far . substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of `` holes '' in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters . almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different . star wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even the lowest budget sci-fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at . effects do not make a movie and `` attack of the clones '' is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter . awfully silly dialogue does n't help it neither . in retrospect , i wish that george lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than c3po and r2d2 ( the latter even flies ! imagine that , more capabilities than in the future ) . this premise is even absurd for the world of star wars . according to the story , luke skywalker and his uncle owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old . as i 'm typing this review i can imagine myself typing it with a royal ribbon typewriter , that just would n't happen . it is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that lucas created but the movie is full of them . he does n't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years from now . in his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around . i , however have a solution for all these . george lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists . everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past . then , you could buy all versions of the original trilogy ( iv , v , vi ) . as originally shot , the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters , and the `` ultimate enhanced version '' to better match the second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing . then , you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling ( ie. , compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . the only reason i give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ilm still makes the film worth watching at least once . otherwise , i rather watch `` serenity '' which has a more star wars feel to it than this star wars film . the nickname of `` mannequin '' to `` annakin '' is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story
1	hey if you have all seen the works of argento and fulci then you probably understand how illogical giallo is . this was not always the case and some of them come across as quite alright in the end . i would actually recommend this argento 'primative slasher ' over fulci 's `` do n't torture a duckling '' - not anywhere near as good as its giallo hype , this version of the bird with the crystal plumage i watched was uncut and a lot more violent than the pg version that has less murder violence , but is still dark all the same . although i give this five stars , it is more of a three star movie , but this is the one that started a whole cult wave of stuff like this , and for that it is recognized and prized , but you have seen better argento and giallo , i recommend that you get susperia before this . i say stay away from `` do n't torture a duckling ''
0	i did not like this movie . i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity . nonetheless , i found it very disturbing : his lack of concern for his wife and children , how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional , and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have `` a bit on the side . '' and what about her kids ? apart from the first scene we never see them again ; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man . i 'm not a prude , really , but this film left a bad taste in my mouth
0	richard pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian . i consider him the best in the business . but his performance in live and smokin shows he 's still just a rookie . he 's nervous in front of the camera , and says so several times . his material is typically raunchy , but not very funny . you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience . buy this tape only if you 're a die-hard pryor fan , but do n't expect the side-splitting laughter you 'll get from in concert , live on the sunset strip , and here and now

0	to begin with the movie tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.this movie is produced in new york . the protagonist is michael dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.the situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.for the reason that he can not continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed by that time . so there is where dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous . he gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.in addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera . thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing . he has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he did n't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.the characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.the way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear women 's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent . because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work . the stes in the movie are really well done and i like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.the lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated . the costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting , there were not that much music but it was ok . this movie could be reall in life because sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job . i will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life .
1	in the mid-'50s , columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white `` monster '' movies : it came from beneath the sea , earth vs. the flying saucers and 20 million miles to earth . aimed squarely at the youth market , each of these films run less than an hour and a half , and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters . most importantly , each has spectacular special effects by the master , ray harryhausen . in the years before computer-generated graphics , monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons , or , in the case of harryhausen , a technique called `` stop action , '' in which models would be shot a frame at a time ; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly , frame by frame . this was time-consuming , painstaking arduous , and for non-fans , pretty cheesy . but the cheesiness is , in a way , more than half the fun . populated by such grade b through z performers as hugh marlowe , faith domergue and william hopper , these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe . these quick morality tales are a hoot and holler ; a campy , yet and faintly embarrassing , art form that demands the cliché `` so bad that they 're good . ''

1	to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement , but it certainly is a great idea for a film . gibson looks good , weaver looks good , hunt acts good , weir directs good , and the script is better than good . much . it 's a movie about ideas , which earns high marks these days , as so few flics can make that claim . sure , it stumbles a bit , and the ending is purposely frustrating , to carry forward the theme of white guilt and `` what then shall we do ? '' beyond all that , it 's sensual , and unpredictable , and pretty damned intelligent . seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill ? i ai n't . see it for yourself .

1	tangled is actually a really good movie . you have to pay attention or you 'll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie
1	i came to this film after rave reviews from friends , so perhaps i was expecting too much . there is much to admire here ; the acting is top-notch , the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted , and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one . for me , films are all about endings , and i felt in this area after life did n't quite pay off . i did n't really buy into the romance , and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so i could care more whether she gets the guy or not . i also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me . however , these are minor criticisms ; it is a film i will watch again , and recommend to japanese film fans , especially those who like the more slow-paced japanese films such as eureka , moe no suzaku and sonatine
0	the ones that are posted twice do not work . if they are posted once , you can try to download it , but it might not work . the video only worked for about a minute . shame , since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool . the one cent csi works , go download tha
1	i bought it on amazon a few days ago ( i saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it ) and got it today . the movie is awesome . nick nolte and martin short make an awesome team . the story is probably the best part of the entire movie . it 's about an ex-con named lucas ( nick nolte ) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by ned ( martin short ) . there are so many funny scenes on here . here are the funniest ones : 1 . they think ned ( martin short ) is giving birth ( he stuck a teddy bear up his shirt to make it look like he was pregneant ) 2 . when doctor horvath ( kenneth mcmillan ) gives his story about lucas ( nick nolte ) ( tells about the `` hunting accident '' ) and there are a few more . there is even a bit of drama in the movie , most of it involving ned 's daughter , meg ( sarah rowland doroff ) . this movie is perfect . i recommend it to everyone . if you have n't seen it yet , you must see it now . because if you do n't , you 're missing out
