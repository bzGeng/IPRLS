0	i 'm an amateur photographer and i use photoshop cs2 for most of my digital editing . i decided i needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that i have read on digital editing . i had to download an update of the software program before i could start using my spyder . this procedure alone took several hours because i kept getting `` error '' messages . i ca n't count how many times i unloaded and reloaded the program . i was eventually able to run the program , however , every time i calibrated my one year old emachine crt monitor , it left me with an orange color cast on my screen . i worked with colorvision technical support for many frustrating hours . the technical support person i was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me . they even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective . unfortunately i was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor . after several weeks of trying to get the spyder2 express to calibrate my monitor , i gave up . i just did n't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned . i really wanted it to work . i 'm back to using adobe gamma .
1	i 'm 9 years old and play this game frequently . i love to play it . it 's not frustrating at all and it 's totally exciting with many adorable animals . i did n't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then i bought a dresser and changed her outfit . the pigs are fun to treat ! ! ! ! ! they 're smart ! ! the rabbits are soft and adorable ; having my favorite animal being rabbits . i play this game for at least a half an hour a day and ca n't wait for the next time playing it ! ! ! ! get this game and try it out ! ! it 's the best !
1	i am enjoying the talk now ! learn bulgarian cd . great images , repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words , numbers , time , etc . easy . also , the games add interest . you can print out each section with photos and words in bulgarian . however , i would have liked to see the program come with the cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide .
1	i 'm currently learning how to use this product ; however , one of the first things i noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a service . now of course , this service was n't free and with only 4 employees , the last thing i wanted to do was expend $ 20 a month on a service . was n't that the point of getting quickbooks - so i could do it myself ? now i can understand that tax codes , percentages , etc can vary from state to state , but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks . see , i 'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts . simple would have been fine with me . as for the rest of the program , it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after i figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business . i 'm disappointed that a business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
1	cd installs easily , it even comes with a nice short instructional video . once installed , zoneaalarm is fairly unobtrusive , but seems to get the job done . well-designed product
1	i started with norton ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images . acronis true image backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well . i used it to re-image my son 's computer without any problems . it is a good product for the price . i highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
1	i was bought for my 13month daughtor . this is her favorite litte touch book because lulu is very friendly friend . this is worthy of money . we love it
1	it has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy . invoices in a flash , keep track of your expenses so easily . this program was the best investment and tax deductible ! very easy not complicated !
0	my boss asked me to get this , so that he check out the latin portion of it . what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is *latin* american spanish . the interface was underwhelming . i needed to guess at what did what , because the controls are mostly icons . what 's worse , there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program . apparently though , the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back . if you are learning the differences between us and uk english , its there ! i gave this one star , only because i could n't give it no stars
0	my last roxio product was `` easy cd creator 5 . '' when i switched to a mac i naturally expected `` toast '' to be the mac version of this product . i am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my ( many years old ) version of cd creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of `` toast '' which i unfortunately own . it allowed me to edit video clips , create several levels of customizable menus , customize the size of compression , and burn to a dvd which played on my standard dvd player . toast can create one uncustomizable menu level , has no editing , and locks up every time you drag a file into it . they ( in the product description ) say it reads mpegs but it 's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg . it does n't even read every mpeg reliably . the only thing i can find that roxio adds to toast that is n't in my old version of cd creator is more enhanced mp3 and music features ( which is n't what i bought it for ) . i may have been better off using `` parallels '' in combination with cd creator . i am sorry but compared to roxio 's cd creator ( which is basically the same price ) , toast seems to have been designed by total idiots . and i always thought that mac software was better for working with multimedia
1	do n't think about video capture cards , going into the operating system , or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power , plug dazzle 's usb plug into your usb port , and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on dazzle , install the software , and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting . excellent quality , and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like , say , if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r . the test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes , and your work is done . i really like the fact that the software is so stable , i recorded a six hour vcr tape using a 512 meg xp machine - not a moment 's problem . they also included software that makes editing these video files real easy , if you want . that is just icing on the cake . strong , solid , silent - the john wayne of vcr to computer file translator tools . as an aside , i have held onto some vcr tapes for years , one for more than a decade , hoping something like dazzle would come along . prayers answered . just shut up and buy it
0	i work for a software company so i know a little about the user interface concept . this is one of the worst packages i have ever used . i just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right . the automatic dimension builder did not work . i had to draw it , and redraw it to get the dimensions right . then i added a few windows and doors , and 2 porches . then i tried to use the camera to get a vertical view . the whole file blew up - ca n't find it anywhere . the manual is useless , and the tutorial cd is just an overview of each topic . what a waste of moeny
1	i have been a corel user for years . this latest version is a great improvement . esp for raster to vector tracing . i have always preferred to use corel over our illustrator even though i have both installed on my system . corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program . very powerful for anyone from novice to pro user
1	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine
1	great deal , great price , great product . emedia guitar method is by far one of the greatest computer learn to play programs out there . my order netted me a brand new , factory fresh product , securely and quickly shipped . thanks , again
0	the title of this product is a joke . it should be called `` not easy cd burning '' . roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is . it is way too complicated for burning simple cds
0	i contacted the program 's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what i did . i received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of january . mid-february i asked again about it as there had been no fix . that time they said it would be fixed by the end of february . i 've used their previous programs w/out problems , just wanted more variety so added this one . apparently not a good idea ... ..
1	this program is fantastic . it 's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc . there are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs . you can also make your own card without any help . the same thing for envelopes ! there are also quite a few additional projects included . you can create your own stationary sets ( paper and envelopes ) , awards and certificates , kid 's activity pages and more . i highly recommend this program if you 're a beginner card maker . i mostly bought this ( i was a beginner ) to save money on cards and in the 2 months i 've had this program , it has more than paid for itself . it 's much more convenient than going to the store , way cheaper and i really like being able to make matching envelopes .
1	i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end . i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck . once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills . lastly , you have to hit the `` f '' keys and `` esc '' to save and exit the game , not many program make you do that today . overall , i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program
0	never recueved the product . waiting for refund for over 6 weeks
1	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me . i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software . the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process . i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly .
0	i have purchased this product which i run on a dual core processor under windows xp professional . software is very unstable and crashes many times when i want to open a document from a url . scansoft solution is that one should save the document in once pc and then open it up . this is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a band-aid fix . customer service is the worst i have ever experienced and nuance/scansoft need to greatly improve this . i have submitted on various occasions emails which i never ever receive a response . when talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have never ever done so ! ! ! ! extremely unreliable service . i own many of their products and will never ever purchase another one of their products .
1	i have used works type products for years . microsoft works 7 is the best of the lot . it will work on almost any computer in use today and is definitely a best buy at the current price
1	i purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking ( which i usually never do , usually i just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing . ) i came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product . of course , you could acomplish this with ms paint if you really wanted to . one of the main ( and only , in my opinion ) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting . that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it . one downside is that this program , because of it 's many tones , uses and requires quite a bit of space . when i uploaded it on my laptop , it slowed down significantly . so much so that now i load it when i want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again ! xd overall it deserves about 3-4 stars . ^.^
0	i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $ 20 coupon inserted
1	i bought this for my four girls . they all love it , ad are learning lots . but the quality of the graphics , characters , and even theme ( or story ) seem to be low budget . we have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch ( and play ) . the overall quality in our other games is much higher . it is a lot like comparing disney cartoons to speed racer . but ... my oldest , who is 11 , still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything i write about here
0	the features of the program are great , but it crashes way too much . my computer system is fully adequate for video editing , so that is not the problem . i 've gotten to the point where i save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash
1	voice recognition software continues to improve . i 've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period . before investing in this software , though , check carefully the specifications of your pc . the faster the processor and the more ram you have , the better the results . the software will run on the minimum specification identified , but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us . this software is useful in many circumstances . many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type . the software can be used with a range of email clients as well as in word processing and other software . you can , as it claims , obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training . but for optimal use , and the best return on investment , consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software . this takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits . i 'll be buying a new pc before i look at upgrading this software . highly recommended . jennifer cameron-smit
1	before buying quickbooks you should google : quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition . this free version never times out . you can immediately download 400m or get the cd with no shipping charge . the big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors , so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs
0	office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word -- anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988 . another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997 . in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997 . apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them -- such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier
0	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security . now i regret buying one . since ive installed it , it slowed my computer , its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off . everytime im on the internet , i get mad and upset . its not worth all the stress . i definitely dont recommend this product . now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton
0	i was very happy with my quickbooks basics . but for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the basics version , so i was forced to upgrade to pro 2007 . it is much slower than basics , it 's more complicated to back-up ( it asks so many questions ) , also it takes longer to print a simple check ( again too many clicks before it prints ...
0	this program causes my computers to blue screen . trend micro has been contacted twice , but have not responded
0	i loved the 2006 version of this software , but when i received an email offering an `` upgrade '' to the 2007 version , i decided to improve what i had . i could not be more disappointed . the resulting product is a miserable failure and i 'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it . this version prints everything off center . i can play with some of it to center it , but not the hallmark logo , etc. , on the back . the result is a very unprofessional mess . i went online to report the problem saw they have a faq on the issue promising that `` soon '' they will have a `` fix '' i can download . three months later and still no `` fix '' . i 've written nova 3 times , they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response `` keep checking for updates '' . finally , after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them . when i received the 2007 edition , which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version , i threw away my old software . i 'm now thinking of purchasing it again because i found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes , add photos , etc . maybe some of these do n't have this technical problem , but just be warned
0	extremely difficult to unistall . endless loop . do not buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience . i will never use nav again
0	please see reviews of the previous version 7.0 . the adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software . too bad such good software is hampered by such a process . being in the software business , i do n't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much . you might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation ( and not bother you with notices of reactivation ) but that also means you open it for adobe to do their push marketing into their software . i have used adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them . too bad , they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing
1	i 'm an old school comic book collectors and i bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page . this is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art -- and i still find there 's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
1	kudos microsoft . my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version . at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface . the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore , confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly . the new interface is quite simple but very powerful . it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating . perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics . if you have not tried encarta in a while , check it out , there is much to like .
0	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc , so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive . after about 6 months of 'trying ' to use it , i finally gave up and uninstalled it . reason , most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it . twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch , but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup . now , the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image , but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups
1	this program does what it says . it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer , so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
1	used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton , mi ( in the u.p . ) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections ( lost signal a few times ) . this works best when you have two people ( driver and navigator ) as looking over at a laptop while driving is n't a good thing ! would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would n't expect it
0	everyone uses office . everyone is familiar with office . so why did ms change the interface to make it nearly impossible to get anything done ? i am computer savy ( i 'm an engineer ) and i find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating . worst of all there is no way to go back to the `` old '' drop down menu system . it honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they 've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons . ms claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you 're familiar with the ribbons . i do n't know/care whether that 's true or not . the learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new ui is immense . so much so that the time investment to become proficient far far far out ways any `` increase '' in productivity ... .not to mention that it 's overpriced . offce 2003 is a far superior product
0	after years of using symantec norton antivirus and related internet security products , the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier . that was until the install started . if you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up , it is over . following the symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows xp install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation . believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing symantec i marched forward . once xp was installed and current with the patches it was time to install symantec again . no luck , i was still receiving the 9999,171 error . now it was time to get someone on the phone for support . this is a good trick since symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support . the number by the way is 877-832-2810 . be prepared for a long wait on hold . during four support calls i experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour . support is provided by offshore resources in india so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier . the four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs , prep for install , reboot , reinstall , hack through the registry , and oh yah corrupt windows xp again needing a second reinstall . during the final call , the support rep finally gave up and indicated the symantec could not be installed on this windows xp machine . i have since moved on to mcafee internet security suite 2007 . the install took about ten minutes and i am now up and running again .
1	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5
1	i used paint shop pro to help build my website . i really like it and i 'm glad i bought it . my favorite part about it is the animation software . you can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects . because of psp 9 my website now has animation , buttons and a banner with bright colors and images ! i love it ! and anyone can use it ! i had no experience with psp or computer art and graphics , but this is pretty simple to use . also you can use psp for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs . this is great software for doing all this stuff and it 's so much cheaper than photoshop . if you 're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work , then maybe you want to check out paint shop pro
1	this is another great card making product but i do n't believe as good as hallmark . but ? i still use it a whole lot and love it ! i know you will too ! try it out ! and take a chance on a great product
1	if you have a mac , and are having difficulties with this dvd , here are some tips . are you opening it with preview ? if you just click on the icon on the disk , it will open in preview ... but this will not work properly . you must use adobe reader to see the pages without the watermark . install adobe reader from the dvd . make an alias of adobe reader and put it in the dock . click and open the dvd icon . click and open the decade folder . do n't open the year folder ... click and drag the pdf icon , ( such as ff_1960.pdf ... i have the fantastic four dvd , so substitute whatever is appropriate ) , onto the reader alias in the dock to open . click on year . click on month . click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size . i hope this is helpful
1	well presented , easy to follow along , and easy to revisit previous lessons . videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played . not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students . some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along . some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking , but again , these are okay for the beginner . the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes . i probably would n't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar ... .and i do n't think most people buying it would think it 's all the will every need to become a great guitar player . i 'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique . i 'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar .
0	i really dislike this software . i 'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way . first , when you initially select files and folders , your disk choices are `` c : '' or `` all '' . i have several disks and i want to pick and choose , but this program makes that really difficult . then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up . choose carefully , because you wo n't be allowed to change it later ! and if you want to do incremental backups , be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save , because you ca n't do it later . basically the entire job , future backups and all , must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over .
1	i am new at researching my family history . the v16 collector 's ed of family tree maker was just what i needed . as an extra bonus it has a 1 yr. subscription to [ ... ] to enhance the research capabilities . i would definitely recommenend this program
1	i was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program . setting up the query parameters is easy the amount of info concerning places of interest ( services , banks , transportation ) is substantial . about the only drawback i found was the quality of the help contents , which was not very user friendly . most of the time i was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated ( displaying data in technical equations ) or was not listed at all . however , calls to technical support usually resolved the questions . finally , i was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map ( ie : a listing of addresses for your push pin locations ) . other than that , the program is very handy , loaded with tons of great data the quality of the maps is superior .
1	it was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade word and excel , and to get virtual pc ( for access ) as well . i used them a lot on my pc a few years ago , and when i first switched to mac , could n't find software that did what they did . i had no trouble installing the upgrade on my imac g5 , nor did i have trouble installing virtual pc . the only thing that was disappointing was that i could n't find out whether accessing the internet from virtual pc would open me up to pc-type viruses , or if mac 's unix system would protect me there , too . i continue to be disappointed that the mac version of this software is not as rich as the pc version . but the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do
0	i ca n't even comment on the actual system works application because i never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install ! once i installed it , it asked for a reboot , then came back wtih `` load error ! press a key to reboot ... '' which just lead to the error message again , and again , and again . a chat with tech support ( after an hour wait ) revealed that there are problems with the goback files , so i had to create a bootable cd , and do all kind of things which i have n't been able to do yet since my burner software does n't have image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd . do n't buy it , do n't install it , do n't use it - uninstall everything norton/symantec and never go back . i 'll be lucky if i ever get my computer working again ... ..thanks symantec ! ! ! !
1	excellent product . the 'over $ 450 value ' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value . during installation , the 1 year free trial to [ ... ] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support . ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their us deluxe product over the phone and did n't ask for a credit card number for renewal . to me , that 's a sign that they 're a reputable company . some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation cd but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the gensmart software .
0	i purchased the upgrade since i 'd already bought both office v.x and virtual pc 6.1 last year . the biggest letdown is that microsoft 's promised support for the g5 is nearly non-existent . i have a dual processor g5 with an ati radeon 9800 card ( apple ) , and after trying to install virtual pc 7 three times , i can not get a vm to work . it did install ( and work ) flawlessly on my g4 powerbook . googling for reviews finds it 's very hit or miss , but if ( when ) it misses , you 'll regret investing the extra $ $ $ in an immature product
0	my daughter and another second-grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow . the controls are not very logical , and there is no animation to speak of
1	challenging and fun . graphics a fair compared to the mindless flashy video games . educational value is exellent , challenging and helps develop speed as well as accuracy . the challenge of having to think and get the right math answer in order to advance makes the games more challenging than the flashey graphic video games . if the animation was similar to the flashy video game adventures ( ie : jak 3 or ratchett and clank ) it might make it too hard because of all the distractions and tools obtained . it might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game . the younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled , multi-level , multi-directional with more mapping and varied spatial orientation than older people . my eight year old was able to gain more speed quicker on the game than i was
0	despite generally good experiences with microsoft products , windows live onecare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new lenovo pc running windows xp . i removed it and performance has improved back to where it was , now running mcafee for virus scanning etc
0	i did n't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world . the problem i had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it . i had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that i was in auto enrollment ! when i called to complain they of course had someone who could n't inderstand me and i had to spell my e-mail address three times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because i work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day ! i asked for a manager twice , the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if i was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine , and was put on the never-ending hold until i gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along . so i called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment . now i am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
0	i have used taxcut and turbotax on and off for years . turbotax tends to have less problems . this year taxcut was incredibly difficult . first it would not properly import the data from deductionpro . then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information . finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data . also , when i received the taxcut email that the irs had accepted my return i logged on to taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number . taxcut would not recognize that i had efiled and would not check for the dcn . i had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone . because of these delays i have still not finished with the state return . i do n't know if i will buy this product again .
1	i find turbo tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program . i really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version does n't come with state tax features . well , if you are going to shop online , you 'd better learn to read the specifications for products ! i came to amazon precisely because i knew i 'd be able to find what i needed , for less . texas has no state income tax , so i make sure that i buy turbo tax for federal only . thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest
0	i thought this would be a good product for my computer . i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download . during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove ( uninstall/delete ) all of your known antivirus , spyware , and firewalls from your computer prior to install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message . i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download . i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support , they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue . they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support , those that know the basics and those that know more . they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the `` teir ii '' agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over the next two weeks , all of them were outside of the specified time . i missed several of them because i have a career and a life . when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue . here it was , two weeks after i purchased the software , i still did not have what i needed . i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software . i called in several times druing the ordeal and the `` teir i '' agents just told me that i have to wait for the call , `` they 'll get to it when they get to it . '' i was very upset with the customer support , i have no idea how the product is , but the customer support is just horrible . go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the `` post your own thoughts '' page through member accounts , you 'll see that i 'm not alone in this issue . i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare . i did not have one problem with these installs . please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you can not download due to a problem with your operating system ( seperate from onecare ) . this costs an additional $ 35 ontop of the cost for onecare
1	this is the second generation of this software i have owned . it is a great navagation tool , better than most online sites and can be used in the car . i marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the lexington , kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth , with new streets and roads . the software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map , so you do n't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night . major points of interest are also on the map
1	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment . the product provides learning words together with listening , seeing , and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases . it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace . the product has been worth it 's hefty price . i do recommend purchasing a german/english dictionary to accompany the software . i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone , so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language , such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings
0	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have . 15 years of outlook and you ca n't print a single address label or an envelope with one click . ( or 10 clicks for that matter ) there is no function to easily print out mailing labels either . lets remember outlook is a contact manager ... next to many other things ... maybe outlook 2010 will be the answer .
1	thats really my only complaint with this game , every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same . being in australia , we had our own fast cars , the falcon gtho phase 111 , the hk monaro gts and who could forget the torana gtr/xu1 , ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the usa or england . but they where supercars in their day , that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik
0	i was required to purchase this with my new computer . i thought i 'd give it a chance at work . we have a dedicated wired network , which just requires that you register the machine 's mac address with our dhcp server . nice and simple , and very much like the lan in any home where the user has a nat router . i plugged in the network and tried to get the mac address . vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network . ok , i tried the wizard . it offers to let me setup pppoe with a username and password . that 's it , no other options . i asked for other options , and it only offered that i use a modem ( that i did not have in my computer . ) no options for a dedicated network at all , that i could find . i went to another machine ( on the 'net ) and searched google . none of the microsoft sites were helpful in any way . lots of pr posturing , but no useful information or troubleshooting . i gave up , found the license and install disks for windows xp , and downgraded the new machine . it was far , far easier .
1	i am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru , but based on my experience with this product i am very satisfied . i love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease . i have only used it for a month now and i still have to use some of the applications yet . if you have the money and will love to have a new office suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day , go for it
1	having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful . whenever i had some down time i always wished i had my bible . now i do at all times . it is easy to navigate . takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared , but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm , it works great . i have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses . great product !
0	i have been using paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions . after reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from nuance website , i can not justify upgrading my paperport software to pro given its current cost . i am pretty sure that a lot more people ( especially loyal users like me ) would snap it up if it was little cheaper . i will probably wait for some time for price to go down ... . it will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet ! ! ! ) and become compatible with vista . for those of you who got lotsa money ( please send me some ) , i would recommend paperport as a decent doc managment s/w
0	i agree with reviewer mr. dietz . i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for $ 24.99 . put it in and loaded it in . this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all . no help menu either . we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her . there is nothing here to learn chess from
0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language . it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word . in addtion , the micro does n't work well with ms word .
1	seems to do the trick . i do n't use it personally but mom likes it
1	worked as expected . a few hardware glitches but that was to be expected
1	a good product but like a lot of microsoft releases , not everyone outside of microsoft is ready for it . check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with expression web . that is a problem i have run into . in fact some hosting services that support front page , have n't even come to full support of front page 2003 let alone expression web . you could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
0	i think this product is highly overated and this claim of being 99 % accurate is false . once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100 % accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when you realise that the very next sentence is complete gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted what you have in that manner . i think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an american accent may get good results while a person with a british or an australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training . in summary i think the program is unreliable with an accuracy of 45 % at its present level of developement . it has plenty of potential and with future developement it could much more reliable but at its present level of developement i think the performance is mediocre .
1	it does the basic job well . the calibration runs smoothly and accurately . hardware looks and feels solid . my two completely different brand , size and age crt monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side . user interface is merely adequate . pop up help instructions are better than many i have seen . you will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work ( the hardwired buttons on the monitor , not software ) . in order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you can use `` back '' within the calibration , sometimes you must start over . also the separate `` profile chooser '' utility software , has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier . you can see it with windows display properties , but it may not appear in the profile chooser list . dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version . yes , it does dual monitors , but with an asterisk . it will create separate profiles , but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards . if you have a single video card with dual outputs , it will load the same profile ( the last one you created ) to both monitors at startup . this quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk ( and blames windows for the problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material , catalogs , or on the box . fortunately there is a work around ( not documented ) at least with my particular video card and running xp . after windows opens , you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor . you may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default . once it 's all set up , running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure , but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles . and check it after you open the application . i 've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .
1	quickbooks lives up to it 's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software . it does what you want it to do . i like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices . if you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
1	this software was easy to install . the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated . i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me . the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood . my one wish is that there were more varied games included ... . but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..
1	the engine behind this program is from chief architect , who , from what i understand , are developers of professional cad software . it shows in this program . while this program has one of the best 3d walk around and capabilities , i tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses . and this one has some good usable tools . like most consumer level landscaping programs , this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home . unlike other programs , the bhg software allows you to import and mask your own plant images . this is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use . all the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there . for now , and with the choices i know of that are available to you , i find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there . this design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial cd . it was easy to install and start using right away . i think most folks would do quite well with this one .
1	i purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal ( nonbusiness ) matter , so the noncommercial license was fine for my `` home '' use . good thing i checked with corel after buying it and seeing the `` home edition '' captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the `` wordperfect '' and `` quattro pro '' components ( inside front box folding cover with velcro ) . corel ultimately confirmed to me that `` certain components that are designed for the business customer , such as legal tools , metadata removal , document compare , quickfinder to name a few are not included in the home edition version . '' corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the `` home edition . '' i focused on the word processing application , but the quattro pro application is also captioned as `` home edition '' so it may be missing some features available in the quattro pro included in other suite versions ( standard , pro , student/teacher , etc. ) . the home edition may still be suitable for some users , but i 'm a strong believer in `` full disclosure . '' wordperfect itself is a great program . try setting point sizes with decimals in word -- you ca n't . try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in word -- there 's no direct control of it ( the microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get word to adjust the font size ) [ but remember , you need any wordperfect version other than home edition to get legal tools ]
1	i have used wordperfect and quattro almost from their inception , so i have seen both of them improve over many years . those years of practise have resulted in wordperfect office x3 , a really outstanding product . because many other organizations and people that i work with use ms word and ms excel , in the past i have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response . now , however , wordperfect and quatropro can translate word and excel , incoming and outgoing . therefore , i no longer have to maintain two office programs . many years of using wp office have probably prejudiced me , but i find it more user friendly than ms office ; however , the biggest difference is that corel is responsive and helpful whereas ms is almost impossible to deal with
0	contrary to the other review , they did ship the proper 3 user version . however , since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100 % of my systems resources and i can not find any setting to have it stop . evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage . what a mess of a product .
0	microsoft office can be handy to have . the files you can open , edit and create with it ( most notably .doc , .xls , and .ppt ) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it 's ( relatively ) intuitive . it has a pretty broad array of useful functions . it 's also obscenely expensive , considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc , .xls , and .ppt ; intuitive interface ; and functionality -- for free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i was looking for basic functionality , but i was pleasantly surprised ; openoffice does most of the neat tricks , too . ( actually , it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate : it 's open source , so it can respond to the needs of individual users . you just say `` add this neat trick ! '' and someone will likely be able to do it for you . ) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice does n't . but considering the price differential , i would n't splurge on this before checking .
1	i enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find encarta a useful tool . i 'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events .
1	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine
0	this is a good product , except it keeps shutting down when i have my outlook or when i have a web page open . my main goal for an antivirus would be to run when i search the web or get in new emails ! what good is it if it shuts down when these are open ! it did find a trojan on my first scan . this was one that norton missed . i will be getting nod32 soon . sorry this product did not work for me ! it was very easy to use
0	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole , and i , too , could n't find it . there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole ... except the jewel case which insists it 's there . i 'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out : i consider this a very bad start
1	the layout of office 2003 is better than office 2003 , which has improved my efficiency . for those who spend all day working with the outlook package , it 's worth the money to upgrade
1	this is my first review but i just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program . i bought this game when my children were in kindergarten and second grade . fritz and chester 's program is so engaging . there are rhymes and chants for each piece 's moves as well as for some other `` strategy-type '' moves . for example , `` a knight on the rim is ugly and dim . '' what a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play ! this program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies . i would recommend getting fritz and chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play ! my boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade . their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments . fritz and chester 2 is also great and my boys , now in third and sixth grade , still play it
1	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great . i have elements 4 and can see it got better .
1	i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something that really , really works well , in a highly flexible and controllable way ! what a relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , and other packages i have tried and reviewed . the key capability lies in the `` save as '' command , which includes `` optimized pdf '' as one of the file types . the `` settings '' there gives you the power to choose jbig2 and jpeg2000 compression , the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers . and of course , as pdf , they are easy for anyone to read . an example : two weeks ago , the world 's top empirical nuclear physicist , in japan , sent me a set of 24 1-meg jpegs for a 24-page paper . nothing i had would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix the pages and crop them ; in adobe 6.0 , they ended up being a readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out at work , and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( the copier was modern and `` intelligent '' . ) then , at home , in adobe 6 , it would optimize it to pdf version 6 , a nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got it to 940 k ( and better quality , to the eye ) in acrobat 8.0 , in a controllable predictable way . i had previously tried many , many other options ( including lots of microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i have seen ... i could have used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all that printout and scan nonsense ! the direct control in the `` save as '' command gets rid of the need to do all that . what 's more , i just reduced a 3.5 meg file ( from the best previous material ) to 1.02 megs . ( as best i recall , i used cvision before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better . ) if you google a lot on compression and comparisons , you will see some small advantage of cvision over older versions of adobe image capture and acrobat . but that 's misleading . in acrobat 6.0 , i could n't get to that better compression . ( maybe if i had a phd in adobe , i could , but i tried hard.. ) . with 8.0 , it was easy . and the results are better than cvision now , so far as i can tell . i certainly see no value at all in the new xps formats microsoft is touting , with vista , now that something so much better is available . one caveat : published benchmarks say that the djvu format may be better yet . i did not consider it , partly because of cost , but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going to my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again ... knowing what lies behind djvu.. we might figure out something even better ... eventually ... and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that !
1	it 's a useful tool . combined with another norton 's products ghost , you can easily perform pc maintanence using these tools
1	i enjoy using encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information . i use it in conjunction with britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information . i do prefer the interface and ease to britannica 2007 but the quality of information on britannica is always to be trusted . my advice you need to buy both
0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever . first , it does n't work . second , i can not obtain any support from roxio to find out why . they wo n't give support until you register , the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software , and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist , or is always down . thus , it turns out to be a complete waste of money , not to mention several hours of time . run , do n't walk away from this software and this company
0	norton is still the 800lb . gorilla of antivirus software , but i think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better ! the old days when peter norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone , and these days norton is just a mass produced product of symantec 's . customer service is through an internet database , and you must pay over $ 40 just to speak with someone even when norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in . the biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources . it is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on norton these days . i bought trend micro 's pc-cillin and have not looked back . there product is less expensive and includes free phone support , and they have received all sorts of awards for their product
1	i really love this bible . even for someone who is well-versed in bible scripture , this adds a new dimension to your understanding . i purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i purchased one for my mom for mother 's day .
0	i 'm sure it 's a good product for beginners , but i already had an older version of quickbooks ( from 1995 ) and the only way i could export/import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro . simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions
1	the software was just what i expected and very useful to me when creating publisher documents that need to be emailed to clients .
0	i 've used ms streets and trips for years with minor problems . this year i upgraded to a windows vista laptop and wanted the latest software for it . i have a gps and i use a pocket pc pda so i need pocket streets . after i got home i read the fine print on the box . it list support for no higher than the windows xp os . but , so far the program is running fine on my vista machine . the laptop has no serial com ports and s 2007 wo n't detect a usb port . the description of s 2007 which includes a gps indicates it uses a usb port but apparently it needs the included usb adaptor . i could not locate where i could purchase such an adapter . s 2007 no longer ships with pocket streets . nor could i locate where i could download a copy . i can ( for now ) use my old pocket streets program because 2007 does export pocket street maps . finally , within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90 's . the main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet s 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when i get directions i always end up down a dead-end road . i 've purchase many versions of streets and trips and this is the first time i felt i 've wasted my money . open software ca n't be returned from where i purchased it . i guess i 'll have to start researching other software packages .
0	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good . the user interface is quite honestly shameful . software companies got away with this years ago , but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces ( e.g keyboard short cuts are missing ) . integration with word 2003 is weak . numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow
0	i should have ordered thru amazon to avoid the confusion , since they state the vercsion needed , but where i ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement , and on the box cover , there is no stipulation about this , only a generic statement that a previous version is required . how hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work ? ? ? ? ? ? adobe customer service would not budge , so i am returning the product . of course , christmas is ruined for the person i bought this for , and i am out shipping and handling charges . thank you adobe . obviously , i ca n't recommend anyone buy from adobe at this point . it 's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish
1	i have used a few other genealogy products and this is the best so far . i am a novice and for me family tree is easy to use and has a lot more features than roots magic . the initial cost was more but the extras included made it a better value
0	i bought this to upgrade my previous version of mcafee total protection . the first install was on a laptop , when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my wap setup without notifying me . first of all it said that i did n't have any security set up on the wireless connection ( although i have it set up with disabled ssid , mac filtering , wpa protection ... ) , and after it was done it had changed the setup to wep ... also causing my other wireless pcs ( that do n't have mcafee ) and my xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network ... so i ended up deinstalling that part . second pc : regular desktop , after installing the software ( only select pieces : antivirus , firewall , spamkiller , privacy service ) my multimedia sharing to the xbox 360 no longer worked . contacting mcafee support never yielded any usable response ( 'reinstall ' seems to be the default answer ... ) . deinstalling/reinstalling did n't help , opening up the firewall did n't help , etc . etc . so i ended up reverting back to my old version of mcafee . i consider myself a power pc user , i 've set up and configured dozens of pcs over the years , built my own pc , and i can honestly say that i have never used software worse than this one . i hardly ever write reviews , but i had to write this one . be warned ! maybe mcafee will eventually get its act together , but for me it 's time to move on . one last comment : this mcafee software ( just like prior versions btw ) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory ) . not good if you do n't have ample memory
0	there are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the toshiba satellite m45-s355 . the hardware incompatibility issues w/ the dvd-ram drive , the gl910 chipset , and the soundmax integrated audio drivers are known to both microsoft technical service personnel and their counterparts at toshiba . i spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies ( both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as `` english '' ) . the amazon representative with whom i spoke was in new delhi . i ultimately figured out ( on my own ) which toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded ( again consuming hours of download time with a 56k modem ) , and i used an iomega cd-rom usb external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours . i was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install small business accounting 2006 . do n't buy these products unless you absolutely must . microsoft 's `` technical service '' is a euphemism more aptly meaning `` technically useless '' . there is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of microsoft xp professional . i should also mention that both the toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from amazon
1	av materials for catalan are very difficult to find . but catalan is certainly worth investigating , and this makes for a highly pleasant intro . now if only eurotalk would come up with a second cd
1	first , if you 're thinking about using these photos for print , you may wish to think again . most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height , or 1-2 inches at 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than that , and they 'll start to blur and/or get jagged . also note , that if you try to export/save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting , the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size , causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate . you need to use the `` use image 's full size '' checkbox when exporting images . if you specify a 300 dpi size , and do n't use that checkbox , you 'll get a stretched image . for example , the first image in the collection ( the pocket watch ) is only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the `` use image 's full size '' box , the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide . the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project . all that said , if you 're going to use the images for the web , they 're great . you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three `` photo objects '' collections , each of which is much more expensive than this single collection . the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20-30 % higher resolution ( i.e . the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide , but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects ) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background ) . for the price , this is a good collection . there are lots of shots with minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but for someone trying to get something just right , that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered
0	this was a huge waste of money . if you have plans to make a custom animation , do not buy this . anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters . you can not change eye color or hair color . if you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $ 10- $ 20 . their free ones are completly dumb . using their `` easy to use '' bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use . it took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure . ( which did n't work very well ) you ca n't even group anything unless you buy their $ 180 upgraded version . i spent hours trying to use this , and could figure none of the above out . it also took two weeks to get here instead of four days . i do n't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator .

0	while installing norton antivirus 2007 xp , a norton message flashed that i must delete webroot for msn . i did it , and it resulted in crashing the session . tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait . then ried the online chat . the wait went on for 9hrs , started # 245 in the queue and by now in lline at # 59 i realized this was not the norton i 'd used for so many years , i ordered kapersky anti-virus .
1	i have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it . it loads very fast ( unlike all other adobe versions ) , the conversion to pdf from doc or ppt files also is much quicker . i have not encountered any problems yet , but its only been 7 days since i am using it.. definitely worth the upgrade
1	i have been supporting quickbooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years . this year 's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer 's invoices , payments , estimates , - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list . no more multiple clicks to create customer reports . it is just plain easy , and the information pops up on your screen immediately . congratulations to intuit on a job well done
0	this concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible . my 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse . and we could n't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game . and playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels . and ... did they actually test this thing on humans ? what a waste of potential . it is a good concept
1	my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it
0	in wandering around the web , i find i am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing ( from photoshop elements 5 ) . when importing , lightroom `` thinks '' for a long time ( that 's fine , and they do warn you it can be slow ) , but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import . about the rest of the program ? i do n't know . too frustrated just trying to get it up and running .
1	the program seems to be much more accurate . i am still learning but i feel it was a worthwhile investment . i can write my e-mail much faster now . i highly recommend it and i feel it was worth the cost
0	i just installed autoroute 2007 . there is a feature in autoroute where you can display various places of interest on the map . in this version , for some installations you can not hide restaurants . this has been reported on the microsoft uk autoroute community website . i loaded the program on a second computer with the same result . both systems run window xp pro . this means for certain cities , like paris , at certain magnifications , the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant . microsoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of autoroute . they also say earlier versions were not affected . you may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show/hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed . i am going to try finding autoroute 2006 for sale
0	you can get mac os x for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the microsoft 's 227 dollar home premium which is the low end . buy mac and get all the functionality in one os . when spec'ed out the system are comparable in price , except apple does n't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive
0	acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram )
1	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp . it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform . but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels . just a matter of display preference , so it 's not that important to every user .
0	their approach might work for other languages , but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language , which rosetta stone never explains . it simply displays four pictures at you , with some incomprehensible ( to a beginner ) chinese near them , and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures . i 've taken chinese for two years , and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it . i either knew the words already , or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach . i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course , but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online
0	i 've been using quicken for windows for years . since i recently bought a mac , i thought i 'd switch quicken over from mac to windows . forget it ! the mac version is totally incompatible with windows , you must export your data and then re-import it on the mac . this works ok for simple checking / visa accounts , but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts . if you look on quicken 's support site , they say `` reinvest dividend , reinvest income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered* '' hello ? ! like i 'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions ? with most major products ( adobe creative suite , ms office ) , the same files work transparently across mac and windows . quicken 's inability to even import the data , nevermind actually opening it , reeks of incompetence . stay away from this product
1	at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991 . i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a `` cool '' os
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users ' favorite features , like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become . more than anything , version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely , providing complete control over your document , who can open , print , or even comment on it . but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade , as it cures many of the ills of the previous version . best of all , adobe has kept the price the same . very nice
0	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use . it lets you print cards of many sizes . the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program . the back of the box claims `` 4500+ cards and sentiments , celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions '' . that 's nice . the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program . it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments ? are you supposed to design them yourself ? i just do n't know . and certainly `` cards for all occasions '' means just that , does n't it ? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind . i guess you just need to buy those on your own
1	i had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7 . even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs . i can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes . this reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document . for these reasons i 'm quite satisfied with the purchase
1	excellent for the novice . i callibrated three monitors with the spider . prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other - after i was amazed how close the images were to each other . the process is so simple that even a cave man could do it .
0	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album . when trial time expired , i purchase the full package . i could not open the existing album with the new software . the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found . use something else ! ! ! i even e-mailed corel about this . its been 4 days , i have not had a response . do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a -2 stars
1	i initially purchased creator 9 to do the same thing this software does , but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the dvd . this software is pretty much easy to use , comes with two ( bibles ) manuals , plenty of information in there to creat some good videos . i recommend buying this or you can always buy creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one . you will be happy with the videos you make . you can make a video containing still images ( pictures ) , video from camcorder camera or from your computer , add text in the movies , add background music , its awesome . i must say again it wont hang your system . please get it , your family and yourself wont be disappointed .
1	i found the product to work very well for antivirus , spyware and spam . it is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance . i had been using norton 2004 , but it only did a good job on viruses . although it would detect spyware after the fact , it did a poor job of removing them . i had also used the ms beta , which although detected more spyware than norton , would not block it . i had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware . since i installed pc-cillin , i 've had no problems . i 've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well , catching about 80 % of the spam . i had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook , that probably only blocked about 40 % of the spam , so this is a big improvement . my only complaint is the rebate- i sent in the required info and it was rejected due to `` invalid/missing ups . '' i then sent a copy of the ups they indicated that was missing , but never got anything back .
1	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas . they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them . they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds . i am sure this one will too
1	it is a little bit clumsey . when i go to it , instead of my cursor being in the space where i write the word for a definition , i have to place it there and that takes time . the first one of these electronic dictionaries i had ( about 5 years ago ) was fabulous , it was called `` deluxe '' and had everything , but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again .
1	zonealarm by checkpoint is one the best programs for protecting yourself . it is better than norton internet suite
0	being a pc user for many years ( since 1985 ) i have come through all the versions of ms operating systems ( does anyone out there remember 3.5 ! ) ms has also piggy backed this `` robust '' office product for 20 years . their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar . this is no exception , but this time i like the tool bar ! as to ease of use , i use powerpoint and word often and my spouse uses excel . if there were an easier product available we would buy it but then windows xp would kill it on sight and vista would stop working altogether . why does ms think that everyone but those working in a professional since ( hence office for professionals ) needs all the junk they subject us to ? do those guys in redmond still think adult users of the pc like `` cute '' things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question ! i am tired of beta testing ms products for so many years but as a pc user i am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system , other than mac , we are all stuck with them .
1	maybe i 'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together , but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product . to accomplish the reports that i need , i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose . so , it gets the report done , just not as nicely as i had hoped . tracking work is made incredibly simple . rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
1	as far as gps software goes , there is nothing better available than streets trips and autoroute . there are dozens of features that you ca n't find with the self-contained gps units . it is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order , night-view is another great feature , as are the topographical maps . the new feature offered this year , of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map , is also a welcome addition . the only reason i 'm giving it a four is because of the following : 1 ) there is still no ground-level or 3d view of the roads for use in the gps function 2 ) they still have n't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them . 3 ) there is n't a lot of coverage for eastern european countries , most notably , nothing in russia . nonetheless , it is still better than any other gps software on the market
1	i love this adobe product . it works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that 's only a minor annoyance . overall it is a very good product
1	i like the product and bought it after having the individual versions on a couple of pcs . it was easy to setup and i love the feature set . the vsmon.exe file uses a lot of memory , though , and the pc seems to slow down some .
0	if , like myself , you have many dx and vst plug-ins installed on your system , then audition 2.0 is definitely not the choice with you . somehow , the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as waves diamond bundle . oddly enough , this was not a problem in earlier editions of audition , or its former incarnation , cooledit . but now , audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many vst and dx plugs ( except , of course , the ones made by adobe themselves . ) bottom line ? this software is crap . absolute crap . if you 're serious about audio production , go with wavelab . heck , even free multitrack audio software like kristal works better than this . if , for some reason , you absolutely need audition , then go with an earlier , more stable version , such as 1.5 . 2.0 is about as useful as a football bat .
0	i have a 2 month old high-end dell pc with tons of memory and disk , running windows xp pro . this game does n't work . period . first of all , when i installed it , it reset my graphics options . second , when i attempt to play a game , even at the settings that it chose , i get nothing but a white screen . after numerous tries , and killing the program with the task manager , i finally attempted the other activities options . clicking on them does absolutely nothing ! it does n't recognize my mouse clicks . i 'm assuming that the game was written for the apple mac , and ported to the pc . trust me , it does n't work . btw , we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them . now i have to figure out how to return this silly thing .
0	this software messed up my computer big time . it does something first of all , to microsoft word . word does not work properly after installation of photo explosion . it then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up . at first i only suspected it to be photo explosion . i had to have my computer sent back to hp . when i got it back i reinstalled photo explosion and the same thing happenend . be careful . product has big problems - which will give you bigger problems - i guarantee it .
0	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0 . performance is very poor , especially the organizer . it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are , such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera , compared to elements . recently , i 've been getting lots of crashes , though everything else on my system is completely stable . the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality , when it works correctly
0	1 . you ca n't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper . useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale . 2 . i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of broderbund 3d home architect . it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better
0	i have used both paperport 8 and paperport 9 deluxe for over a year so i am qualified to report . both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with windows xp pro . i can not really get version 9 to operate . everytime i try its like cold molasses . click ... wait ... .wait ... .wait ... wait ... and then lock up . i 'm very experienced . i 've been working with pcs since 1991 . every other piece of software i 've loaded works very well ... except for paperport 8 and 9 . in theory paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to pdf which is more or less a universal file format . however theory is a lot better than reality . support is nonexistent from scansoft . if you pay the $ 19.95 per incident , you still do not get a solution . the scansoft forum is always either not working ( another bad sign ) or it 's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support . unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives , but doqments looks promising . avoid paperport unless you have money and time to waste
1	i recently purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom . compared to other products that i have evaluated , punch ! interior design suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility , stability , and 3d . it includes many precision , dimension , and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs . using the split 2d/3d mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors . after i completed the drawings i showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as i had envisioned them . like most software i have used , this package does contains a learning curve . i by no means consider myself a computer guru and i had to put in a little practice time . you will find , however , a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project
1	i fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version . when ancestry updated this year i decided i had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on ancestry so purchased this version . i was very pleasantly surprised and happy . i am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info i have entered incorrectly but i would certainly recommend it . the online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome
0	the updates are frequent and expensive . good program , but it 's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading
0	i 've been a long time user of trend micro 's pccillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version i decided i did n't want to take a chance on it so i went looking for different anti-virus software . i stumbled onto this zonealarm ( piece of junk ) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews i down loaded their trial . it did n't seem too bad . after a few weeks i bought this 3 computer suite and installed it . i went a while longer and notice my computer 's performance was not as good as it was . i downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new . now after about a month my computer is practically unusable ( as well as the kid 's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start ) . this zonealarm is the worst software i have ever used . it hogs cpu and memory . it gets the cpu usage to 80 - 100 % and it does n't free it up . i shut down all programs and cpu just keeps churning away . the interesting thing is that at times i would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90 % but when you check the performance tab the cpu chart would be near 100 % ? go figure ! i finally said enough and uninstalled it ( and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry ) and downloaded trend micro 's pccillin . it 's installed and i got my old machine back . log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with za . cpu is back to normal . you could n't give me this cr*ppy software . i wish i would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $ 40
1	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product . i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events . i do have one warning however . provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen . the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use . my wildest expectations were exceeded .
1	i like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer . however , i think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form can not be emailed and how to address that issue
0	this upgrade is a disaster . first of all , in word , the view markups function is the default now , so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups ( most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way ) . however , if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you do n't know which version of word the recipient has , and you ca n't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again , view markups , reject the comments , accept changes , and resave . it 's kind of difficult to explain , and frustrating too . people think that if they ca n't see it , then the recipient wo n't be able to see it either . this is a good explanation from a microsoft help forum : *not displaying* tracked changes is n't the same as *not having* tracked changes . even when using word 2002 , the changes were still in the documents , and anyone could see them just by turning on the display . all that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic . the way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes . nothing you do with the view will be sufficient . if you need to retain a record of the changes , you 'll have to maintain two sets of documents : one with the changes , which *never* leave your office , and another that has been `` scrubbed '' and can be sent out . still , it 's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002 's version . also , outlook 's new default view is quite different than before . the panes are set differently , so you have to go to view/reading panes to change the positions . and then you have to ungroup items ( the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying ... most people do n't like that , although i guess some people think it looks more organized ) . oh , microsoft - ca n't live with it , ca n't live without it . almost forgot ... the buttons/icons are prettier in this version , and we all know that that makes a huge difference . yessss ! pretty buttons ! i can die happy now .
1	ok , sorry , i 've been vectoring line art since 1990 . my current machine is an amd athlon xp with the 333 fsb , 1 gig ram 80 gig hd shared on network a 40 gig hd for software , os is xppro , it 's 2 years old i think . i installed three cathode ray tubes , you know ; big boxy monitors , the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day . i read the reviews here and started `` quaking '' in my boots ! oops i said to myself , and i looked up my previous day 's purchases for the new artist i just hired . sure enough ; i bought cs2 for the new machine . so i downloaded the 30 day trial for illustrator cs2 upyours , i mean upgrade . replacing my old illustrator 8.01 these kids i 've been interviewing made me think i should take a look outside my cave ! so i got it loaded up and sure enough ; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy ; illustrator 8.01 , about twice as long . ( so leave it running ) ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i should have done this sooner , or should i have ? as soon as it was running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it 's adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this is just exactly what people have been complaining about . ******** the bridge is fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep the bridge open on the right monitor and i can drag art into illustrator cs2 at lightning speed . the whole time i get to see super big previews of all the artwork i need to work with . way better than xppro 's little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this is what these companies are using to sell vectored line art to printers like me . it is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now , took a human brain to see past while vectoring . ok , it 's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as ( full of ) myself , but for only about $ 160 or so , it 's like a gift from almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence from adobe once again . do n't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate the object oriented work bar thing at the top , wait , let me go look at what it 's called , hmmmm , still do n't know , well it changes according to what kind of object you 've clicked on in your artwork . also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work . that top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything can be transparent , wow , do you know what that means ? ? ? i got ta go use it some more , it 's just way to cool . ok , i 'm back , even fonts can be transparent , .tiffs .jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back and forth from photoshop to illustrator . but i do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware , operating system , and have at least a year ; full time with illustrator and photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that adobe has opened up for us
0	do n't buy zone alarm if you use aol ; they are not compatable . the pop-ups will drive you crazy and aol wo n't work properly . also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed . i bought it from amazon and had to throw it away in a month ... no refund ; money lost . norton is far better with aol
0	it seems that all previous quickbook versions will not run on windows vista and i had upgraded my system . so , i bought simple start as the least expensive way to get a quickbook product to run on vista . turns out simple start runs fine on vista but you can not load a company file from earlier versions . thus , simple start was simply useless to me . when i called intuit customer service they said that for another $ 100 they 'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature . by that time i was committed and had no choice . talk about getting ripped off ! !
0	looks nice ... but beware ! installed norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office . as soon as i did that our accounting system ( peachtree ) started to lock up a few times a day . even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up . i 've now uninstalled norton 360 on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem . i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security 2005 to 2007 ... never again .
1	great for managing your basic accounts and finances . easy to use . worth the price . interacts well with online banking services
1	my daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use . also , she likes the research tools that it provides . and , it 's easy to use . it 's very practical -- she uses it a lot
1	he trabajado por 14 anos con coreldraw ... .desde casi sus inicios ... para verlo convertirse en un programa realmente poderoso ... sin competencia en su area a mi parecer . en esta nueva version de corel ... el x3 ... les digo que no me ha desilucionado ... .no hay muchas herramientas nuevas ... .pero son excelentes , lo bueno es que se estan dedicando a mejorar las herramientas anteriores ... lo que es mucho mejor todavia
0	i bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant . well , after trying to use it for two years now , i 'm ready to burn it . it 's a great software for people who do their business by the projects , but it 's not good for retail sales . everything has been a hassel , especially trying to set up the daily sales so i can record detailed inventory of my daily sales . yes , i noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales . after i already invested in $ 300 in software and $ 100 in books just trying to learn this system . what a waste !
0	i read the review saying simple start did n't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version . despite the warning , i thought i could get away with simple start because i was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program . even for my simple needs , it was a bust i had to upgrade to pro for an additional $ 100 . if quicken is n't enough for your needs , get pro .
0	bought system mechanic 6 pro online , it repairs but reports problems but you can not get information at all . none of the modules report what is being done . if you need assistance forget it , all you get from iolo is go see the faq 's , i do n't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails . stay away from this company ! !
1	this program does exactly as i expect . i am very pleased
1	i 've been frustrated for quite some time now with having adobe reader and expecting it should do what adobe acrobat can do . i was especially interested in creating pdf 's ( portable document formats ) of word documents . although i have photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way , i was n't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so . faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook , aptly named , `` death by cholesterol '' , i felt justified in finally purchasing not only `` acrobat '' but also `` omnipage '' , an ocr ( optical character recognition ) software . with these programs in hand it made the project fun to do . now i have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page pdf file that can be read and also printed out by anyone i care to send it to over the internet . it 's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though i 've only used a small part of its capabilities . the reason that i 've only given it a `` 4 '' rating ? i 'm upset that i did n't get the full version , but i ca n't justify doing so . i 'm being petulant
1	i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook g4 1.5 . my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer . before tiger , my computer would hang when playing large dv files ( such as the ones i made in imovie ) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same . this tiger upgrade does n't include some of the apps ( games , quicken , etc . ) that my wife has on her new macbook , but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy
0	mutual fund basis calculations are broken , updates fail on the mac . not to mention no state in this edition . it 's absurd how many different versions of turbotax there are this year . it almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes . i 'm done with turbotax , switching to taxcu
1	the product did just what i wanted and that is to burn videos onto dvds from my camera . i had an earlier version of nero but it would not do this .
0	having had norton products installed for years including antivirus , internet security , and systemworks , i decided to replace the installed products with norton 360 and a non-norton password manager . obviously , it is critical to first remove all norton programs before installing norton 360 . the installation process proceeded relatively smoothly . my computing environment includes a 1.6ghz processor , 1,000mb of memory , and 6gb of available disk . the background scans and liveupdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire cpu at 100 % cpu utilization . one application that streams radio broadcasts now stops . i immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups , however , the cpu occasionally still locks . additionally , there is no way to transfer security settings from previous norton products to norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive . if you now have separate norton security products and are satisfied with them , save your money and renew the norton subscriptions .
1	i use my microsoft streets and trips software to plan my route , intermediate stops , and destination for any travel via automobile or truck . i am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which i may be unfamiliar . this is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find . i have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what streets and trips does , and i found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with microsoft streets and trips 2007
0	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money
1	i purchased fix-it primarily to correct a registry problem . it was rated very highly on the pcworld website . it did a great job . i had over 850 registry errors , corrected them and did a reorg on the registry . my computer is running beter now . the other utilities included work as advertised . i have been using norton systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price
1	i am average when it comes to design , but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it 's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it . i like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background . to get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already , and there 's a lot i am missing . i will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error
0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language . it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word . in addtion , the micro does n't work well with ms word .
1	it is the coolest game about horses . it teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses . it is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from mom or dad should be welcome , even though my daughter found things that i did not , it 's a team effort at the beginning . after that it 's just very pleasurable , and can go on for ever . according to my daughter it is very addictive ( ! ! ) and she has already dreamer and lets ride . ok it 's not high visual 3d as the others , but let 's face it , a lot more entertaining . in all it is a real cool game , and worth the 5 stars . perfect gift , and good for mom and dad also ...
1	i purchased this software mainly for web design . i am beginning in web design and found microsoft frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lot of interesting features to design a web site . i would definitely recommend this product
1	bought this primarily for my tivo set , so i could transfer and burn dvd 's from my tivo box . once i hooked up my mac g5 to the tivo box , toast worked perfectly . easy interface , fast transfer , easy to burn . it 's nice to know that tivo supports mac . a great product ! !
1	microsoft really got it right this time . it is the best of the best
1	worked fine for standard items . did not handle partnership issues completely . would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed ( maybe this is possible , but i did not find this function ) . in general , an easy , straightforward program that gets the job done
1	its a good software , it works good and keep the computer safe from spam , virus , and some others malware , try it
0	i purchased this program recently , and was very disappointed . the maps are very limited ... for example , most of the major tourist areas ( beaches , newport , ect . ) in rhode island are cut out of the ri map . i recommend buying ms streets and trips 2005 ( which includes pocket streets 2005 in the box ) instead : http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002doeam/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654 ? v=glance=pc=507846 with this program , you have the entire usa at your disposal , and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone . fortunatly , the store that sold me pocket streets allowed me to exchange it for streets and trips ( after paying the difference ) . the prices are very close .
1	it was easy to use . plus i could import my old tax info from last year , my bank info and my deductions . i electronically filed my taxes and had my refund within two weeks . i buy this product every year and was pleased that deduction pro was included
1	i recently purchased microsoft office , and so far , i have had the chance to use microsoft word . i am familiar with the product as i have had the older version before , with my old computer . i was pleased to find that i had no trouble with using my old files with this new software . i also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use . i was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning . i am also glad that it is n't very much different from the old version , so i was able to use the program easily , without much adjustment .
0	i received the bundle but there is no installation key for shade le . i noticed the someone else 's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so i figured i 'd post it again
0	you can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy . when you 're sure you want it , permanently activate it with the product key you get in your amazon package . the new version of excel has two huge advantages : 1 . it removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation . you can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows . 2 . excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer ( or you can restrict it to use only some , so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine ) . on my dual core computer , excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task . i 've seen no crashes , hangs , or hiccups . but everything else about excel 2007 is frustrating . the new `` ribbon '' interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases . bypassing the ribbon with the new `` quick access toolbar '' is problematic because ( bizarrely ) microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons , leaving them with identical green circles . right now excel 2003 costs more than excel 2007 . if the two plusses do n't help you , you may think that 2003 is worth more
1	i am not a `` computer person '' but found this to be easy , easy , easy
0	( this review is of the spyware edition ) nis takes 25megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one ( if you have & lt ; 256megs your lightweight cpu ca n't carry enough armor to make windows really zero-day net safe imho ) nis has most of the features i look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector , but half do n't work right , and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work . even after liveupdate this week , one buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded , and port 80 was open listening half 'naked ' on the internet . i replaced it , and at the first passing probe my rule was erased , autoreplaced , naked again . only after i stumbled onto the secret trick ( add a block all rule after the pass rules ) did it close it . it took 11 clicks ( ! ) just to add the block all rule - miserable ! the log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining `` permitted once '' 200 times , no actual info until i click on one of them . what 's worse is , none of them i checked were `` permitted once '' iirc . nis detected 2 trojan/spywares , but could not remove either . enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups , all suggesting i block access , but i actually do want ie to access the internet . running windows update brought a popup asking if 100 's more dll 's are ok. how would i know ? i do want windows updated . great feature in theory , totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented . if you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset , plan to either `` permit all '' or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand tcp vs udp etc . why no `` permit all local + dns + outbound port 80 '' choice ? that would mean 1/10 the work ! jetico lets me pick `` web browser '' ruleset , so its ui from hell gets used once per category . after spending all day and half the night getting it working , i discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them . i would be less furious if i had a fresh install of windows , but not much . all good , until a program autoupdates , and 3 more rules to write . too angry for words . jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig . i would not use nis if you paid me 10 times its price .
0	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop . my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too . the colors were spot on . after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse . my monitor appears dim , the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull . if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time . my hope was that it would make my monitor look better , not worse . i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it . instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online
1	i bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great ! my screen broke on my nokia 6102 , and i ended up buying a razor . i had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me . transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes . also , the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone .
0	two weeks ago i attempted to do my taxes on this software . however , it could n't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so i could file . i had two weeks until the update was available . i downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told i had a credit of $ 3,100 . however , it never added this number to my total tax credits . all customer support could come up with was `` start over from scratch , do n't even import your information from last year 's taxcut '' . never again
0	at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great . recently , however , many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines . users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages ( e.g . ms office ) . the word processor in works , for instance , does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch , scandinavian , turkish , romanized russian , japanese etc.. in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway
1	this game is great ! after buying mia reading i thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning spanish since we live in a global village . they game was easy to load , easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners . the high quality 3d animation will blow you away . even my husband who learned 3d animation at the vancouver film school was blown away . the best part is , that they love playing it as they think it is a game . they forget they 're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences . well recommended
1	i think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me . it gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination create new personal things each time you work . the only problem faced me was that it does n't support other languages , but it works with wordart
1	well its definetly improved version since the last one , but they still have a lot of things to do . the biggest problem is pages . if text has specific symbols , like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc , forget it . u 'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago , either funky symbols or underline dashes . keynote is much better . but if u r a scientist and not a sales man , both packages still have a lot of room for improvement . however , i 'm still happy with this purchase , because it 's apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future
0	i used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday . first of all the software takes up a huge amount of space ! like 1600mb . the program is so slow and i have a relatively new computer . after about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes . i had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone . all the work gone . the text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces . sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer . once it added bright green lines where i had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background . i had to redo it . piece of junk ! but what does print on a color laser - do n't try it with inkjet - looks great
1	the hard-copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries , now you can have all of that , with video , audio , tons of photos , and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original . for what you get , it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library
0	i changed from quicken to quickbooks and regret it . yes , quick books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but i have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards . i have also found it difficut to match transactions . to get a better handle on my expenses i am going back to quicken or try another program . online help and tutorials , `` dummies guide ... . not helpful either . you would think see they make quicken they would allow import of qif files . dissapointed .
0	i usually use adaware to scan my computer weekly , and like others , i would like to try the trial version spyware doctor to scan my computer . the result was , i had more than 200 infections ! i was amazed that my other virus scan programs did n't catch any of these infections , and my computer had been running properly . of coz , i would like to remove these infections and so i paid with my creditcard and got the license no . after entering the license no . and scanning , i continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught . before clickinig the remove button , i checked what i would delete and the files seems ok to be deleted . i had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections . i clicked yes to restart . from then , my nightmare began , i could n't start my computer at all ! ! ! not even displaying the loggin window ! my computer just kept restarting again and again . after 5 times restarting automatically , i smelled something burning from my computer ! ! ! i was so scared becoz there are some important files that i have n't backup yet ! endup , i reformat my computer ! ! ! i could n't login my old account again ! now , i have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have . luckily i was able to reinstall 70 % of the softwares ( you got ta know the serial no . for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall , and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them , and not all of them ! ) some of my important files could n't be opened again because i do n't have the softwares to open them ! i was/am still so mad about this ! the spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that 's why i could n't restart my computer . yet , i reinstalled spyware doctor again because i paid and only used it once . however , i could n't use it after reinstalling like other softwares . even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no . that i purchased , it 's just simply not working ( the website said i do n't have to repurchase and it should work ! ) so i paid $ 10 , only used the spyware doctor once , but i lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $ 400
1	i do n't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it . it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did ... .and realize that you forgot to select `` test '' at the beginning . also , it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise ' also ... ... not just the regular exercises . other than these two things , the program is very good
0	after being greeted with much excitement , this program would n't properly install on my not-so-fussy computer . the web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back . very disappointing
1	my five and six year old love this game ! it sparks their interest in things around them and now we play our own `` i spy '' riddles in the car , at dinner or out on walks . i highly recommend it
0	tough to upgrade if you have an earlier version on your machine . also , poor layout of controls make clicking on wrong button really easy . they still have not gotten it right
0	do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date . ( the receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days . ) you do n't have much time to return an item , and the company does not give any leeway for christmas orders . i am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room , and i ca n't exchange it for another item because he did n't like any of their products .
1	understand . i have a full ms new office suite that i got from work . but choose to use this product for the many items included which ca n't be beat . if you just want to use word and nothing else then get it alone . this is fine . but the other products are worth the discount and rebate also . cost is the lowest i found . if you have a reward ceriticate using amazon credit card . that $ 25 more off the price . so in the end it cost me $ 30 for it . shop smart and use any break you could get . right ?
1	... and i knew it would n't be the last . very very fun . do n't think nancy drew is just for girls , guys can play and love the game as well . i am living proof of that . the game itself really is n't that hard , it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky ( i do n't like puzzles ) and that is the only 'beef ' i have with the game , and most mystery games . now , back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline , suspicous characters and they all got something to hide . search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort , run errands , break into locked rooms without getting caught , disable alarms , and snoop.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg . if you like mystery games , nancy drew is for you ! her games are n't overly hard , and they are very fun . even if you are n't a mystery fan , try it ! you 'll love it . try them all ! you will become a nancy drew fan , trust me.. i did
0	the game is called fritz and chesster . fritz is the boy . chester is a rat . that girl you see in the picture , her name is bianca . she never actually plays . she just says things like `` well done , brave knight ! '' and asks stupid questions . at one point poor bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece , and fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father . the tone and context are extremely anti-woman , in my opinion . he also counters by saying that boys are smarter . it seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece `` she '' . to take the queen down a notch , they refer to a group or queens as a harem . to demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can . a male voice says , `` off you go , '' in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind .
1	the item was received promptly and worked perfectly . thanks for a great purchase . bo
1	the operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer . but , obviously , if you want a computer with more security features or networking features , you should go with windows xp professional . at the time that i am writing this , which is a long time from when i purchased windows xp , it is a time where windows vista is emerging . if you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer , i recommend windows xp home/professional ( based on your requirements ) . but if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast , try windows vista . but one word of warning about vista , the user account control ( uac ) is a pain in the butt
0	once again quickbooks dangles promises to us mac folk that just do n't add up . if you 're like me , your accountant and bookkeeper are on windoz - that 's why i was psyched when i thought i would really be able to share my mac qb files with them , and vice-versa . mistake # 1 - i give my bookkeeper a backup from qb 2006 before i updated to 2007 . big mistake . qb is not backward compatable . so when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in mac format , ( after spending hours updating it ) , i was not able to import it into qb 2007 . to me , this is nuts . but the helpful tech person we spoke with , suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between mac and windows versions is sort of a one time deal . this was n't intended to be a back and forth thing , between mac and windows . huh ? so what 's the point ? here 's my work-around : i bought a used xp box on ebay and am trading my mac '07 for windoz '07 .
0	i installed this software after getting it free after rebates , and i must say i am not the least bit impressed . it claims to speed up your system , but instead only slows it down . seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer , but it 's relatively new and has a gig of memory . as another reviewer mentioned , my internet stopped working correctly ( although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet ! ) and my system restore just would n't work . it deleted a lot of entries i needed to run my system correctly . the anti-spyware was an absolute joke the updates were large files almost every day . 8 mb a day practically . on a lighter note , fix-it utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find . i use zone alarm security suite and then use ccleaner to take care of the rest . i think they 're the best combination . no program beats zone alarm 's . fast , secure , and wo n't bug down your computer . i had to reinstall my operating system thanks to fix-it utilities
0	i wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool . this program does not do well with fixing red eye . software did not come with a manual . i am computer literate yet i found this software not easy to navigate . i found hp essentials which is a free download from the hp website to be a better program .
0	way to many problems with this version , if you want to replace all your printers , scanners , sound cards and so on , go for it.otherwise stay away
1	this is a good software for casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . on the positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . the level of details is good enough ( how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet ? ) . the fact that maps are digitally generated ( with vectors i believe ) makes all the labels clear at any scale . it has two advantages over its main `` digital '' competitor , ng topo . first , all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state/region cds from ng . and second , it is available . i could not even find ng 's northeast edition anywhere on the web ! one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations . now the few negatives . the exchange feature with gps is flaky . sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin . part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin ca n't make all their gps with usb in this day and age ) . in any case , regardless of whose fault it is , it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly . the second problem i noticed was with the 3-d window . it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing that window , since it is pretty much for `` coolness '' and does not add any real topographical value . finally , i had a problem with delorme 's service . i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer . however , a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code . the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake . they requested that i send a correct one , but with the code cut out and gone , how do they expect me to come up with one ? ! i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $ 20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it . i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem .
0	i needed a document management system . after looking for software , there only appeared to be paperport . i had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files . i guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least . this concerned me , so i called pre-sales at scansoft , and asked if it was slow with a large number of files . he was not sure ! so he told me to call technical . i called technical , and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me . i asked if he was reading the scansoft website and he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site for an answer , and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it . i got the software . basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software . it worked well , and i thought ok , expensive for what it is , when windows explorer and scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly do most of it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it was my machine so installed it and the pdfs on a new vaio 1.7mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click to view the pdf then hit the return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view a document , it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the paperport desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds ! ! ! completely unusuable ! if you have less than 500 files , it is maybe expensive software , but for more than 500 do not waste you money . it runs so slow you can not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files
1	learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 2 , continues where the first cd left off . like the first cd , this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do , and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game . this program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies . the cd covers some popular opening moves , middle game tactics like pins , forks , skewers and deflection , and mating strategies in end game . with practice on this cd , you can begin to win some games , and then move on to learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 3 , which is out in german , and is supposed to be out soon in english
1	love the program ... . hate the company ! i 've been using quickbooks for more than 10 years . i started with the basic edition since i am a very small business and use only a portion of the program , specifically customer and vendor lists , invoicing , a/r and purchase orders . overkill is an understatement ... quickbooks pro is much more powerful than i need . i do n't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting and many of its other functions . so why did i purchase such a powerful program ? that 's the `` rub '' . intuit is not satisfied with its quickbooks users being content with the edition that they are using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version ( edition ) of their program . they hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support of the product and i had no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition in 2005 . shortly after purchasing it , they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 basic edition and if i wanted continued support i would have to upgrade again , this time to the pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received an email from intuit informing me that my 2005 basic edition would n't run on the new windows xp vista platform and if i switched to vista i would need to upgrade to quickbooks pro . i upgraded to a new pc in february as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with vista , thinking that i could install windows 98 as a second operating system to run quickbooks 2005 basic . the second operating system did n't work out and , after seriously considering switching to microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i was very disappointed that intuit did n't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users ; but they never have in all the years that i 've been using their product . even microsoft , the shark of sharks , offers incentives . do n't be misheartened . i purchased the program from amazon and , with rebates and other purchase incentives , saved $ 60 over intuit 's price ; i could have saved an additional $ 25 if i had bought on ebay ( had i known it at the time ) .
0	h block does a much better job marketing software than writing it . i used the on-line version , had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later . after about an hour of painfully slow entry , sometimes just one item per page , most of the time looking at `` loading , please wait '' i had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save . no luck , repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error , and i could not save without registering . finally just left the computer on and left ; when i came back taxcut had timed out and lost all my data . by the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies . even if you select no you will get frequent e-mails from h block . i will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year . when a company ca n't get something simple like this right , it calls into question everything they do
0	i received this item today and was surprised 1 ) it was shipped from overseas ( uk ) 2 ) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought 3 ) no paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork , info , etc 4 ) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 ( according to sonic foundry 's website ) and sf no longer provides support 5 ) i ca n't get this to register online , which seems a little dodgy , but other than that , it seems functional . no huge library of loops , either . ca n't really say i got what i expected
1	i received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks . it is exactly as advertised . it is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly . i am amazed at the quality of the recordings . i would definately recommend this product
0	i always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous , now i 've seen the opposite . taxcut online seems totally not thorough , such as just asking for total of certain things , and not asking if special circumstances apply , which you do n't miss at all until you have one of them . i had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home . i moved half way through the year . i could n't find where to add an additional home office listing . `` nope , ca n't do it '' said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting , `` you 'll have to use another product . '' so today i start from scratch and pay the $ 99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners . i encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year . s :
1	maybe i 'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together , but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product . to accomplish the reports that i need , i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose . so , it gets the report done , just not as nicely as i had hoped . tracking work is made incredibly simple . rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
0	attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003 ... bad move ... none of my access 97 programs work now ... in fact i , i brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions ... nope ... the upgrade just did n't work ... ..had to purchase a full version to set things right ... save your money on this product..
0	we have kid pix 3 and my kids ( 4 6 ) played it all the time . we just `` upgraded '' to kid pix 4 , and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning . kid pix 4 runs in 800x600 resolution but it wo n't force your screen resolution to match that when it runs . kid pix 3 , of course , did . as we are using a lcd monitor with native resolution of 1280 x 1024 , we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution . so now we are faced with 2 options : 1 ) use kid pix 4 with a drastically reduced window ( the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top ) or 2 ) adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program . i find this unacceptable . customer support is non-existent : if you bought it retail , the learning company wo n't answer your questions and refers you to encore 's website . no patches are available and encore has no way to actually contact them . their faq simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to 800x600 . i think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release . boo to encore , boo to tlc for allowing their `` brand '' to be junked , boo to broderbund . do n't waste your time
1	i really like this program . i have purchased three different bible programs for my pda and this one is by far the best of the three .
1	good product but , it 's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required
0	buyer beware : this program will critically impair your system ! internet loading will be drastically crippled . expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes . there is no way to close mcafee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall . i am going to return this first thing next week . i gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades , but nothing has changed . if only i had read the reviews ahead of time . bottomline : if you do n't mind these side-effects , by all means purchase this program ; mcafee has solid protection . but there are easier ways to get that protection
1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint , this is a great value . before , you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price ( full retail $ 150 now ) . office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for $ 175 plus . this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn . also , do n't worry about file formats . you can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office .
0	i have used ms streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year . it has some map errors that i wish were updated . i read that the delorme street atlas was far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems . not only is the mapping way out of date ( many years ) microsoft streets and trips 2006 maps are far more up to date . on many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road does n't exist in that direction . it does n't even know the name of some very old roads displays ... '' unknown name '' while driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that i am driving 30 feet below . the program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a u-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp . i have used microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable . the delorme is very confusing and frustrating . i 'm sending it back for a full refund
0	norton is now owned by the huge behemouth digital river , who have n't a clue how to run support or customer service . they are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it , would n't consider it . norton used to be top notch , now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer . it interferes with everything . microsoft seems to have given up on them too , as norton has not bothered to interface properly with windows , a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic . i can only warn you ~ avoid ! ! ! a bad bit of software and a company that has n't any clue about what customer service is and does n't look likely to change . profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the norton family of software up to date and working well ...
1	over the last two years , i have found h block 's tax cut software to be simple to use to process an otherwise complex tax return . i would recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable tax preparation source without having to pay the accountant 's fees
1	i previously had nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me . i upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer to vista premium , and i was pleasantly surprised . everything i have tried so far has been flawless . it seems that different systems have different results with nero . for example some people say nero 6 works best for them , but on my old system it was horrible ( running on win2k ) . it 's complicated software though , so people should give nero a break . overall they do a great job . just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system .
1	i recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the pro version , which costs 150 more and gives more functionality . this is a fully functioning animation software , with lots of interesting features . i can see no reason that a novice animator such as i am would not be happy with this software . i would like to see more energy put into a manual , but you can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers , or google other places . with a more robust manual , this would be 5 stars , not 4 . it is really the reason i am reluctant to upgrade to pro , because i would want more lessons and tutorials to go along with the upgrade . if you have an interest in animating , this is the software for you .
1	i have the older version which was great but does n't seem to work on win xp . both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card . 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card , big plus . the graphics are nice and there are many choices . it 's a good deal at the price
1	looked at them all and then bought this software ... it can do a lot of things so , yes , it might take a bit to learn and get fast with . there is a reason it has been voted best for several years now . it does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying , `` garbage in ... garbage out '' 8- ) my wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she 's working on . anything this complete , is worth the learning curve
1	i 've been using turbotax since 1999 . we run two small companies and my background is in accounting . hence , i have a very hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do , since i really have a hard time letting go of the control ! ( i 've really got to get over that ! ! ) each year , it seems that turbotax does nothing but improve ! i typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on april 14 , and if it was n't for the simplicity fo this software , i 'd be filing extentions every year . really , gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part . this software does everything else for you .
0	i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem . so , i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista . it does not . the software crashes at odd times . it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report . it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day . i have set up my old computer , which runs xp , so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version . i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os
0	i just bought this cd because i am learning haitian creole , and that 's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd . when i installed it , i was unable to find anything on the cd in haitian creole , even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case . so it has been a complete waste of money for me , perhaps if i was interested in the other languages i could give it more stars . it also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language , but that is not possible either , u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source . i am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product . if anyone can find creole on this cd i would be happy to stand corrected . ps i contacted imsi and they say the cd 's were mislabelled , there is no haitian creole on the cd , despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
0	when i got this game , i was very excited to play it . but when i played it , i was very dissapointed . the game was very confusing , and hard to control . sometimes , i could n't get my person to go where i wanted it to go . learn from my mistake . do n't waste your money on this game .
1	there have been enough changes for the better to make this product well worth the purchase , installation , learning curve
1	i have a powerbook , an imac , and an emac at home that are used in different ways . the kids use the emac for school work , and my wife i use the other 2 macs for home business . although most school work was required in ms-powerpoint or ms-word , exporting from iwork '06 pages and keynote was very simple to do with 90-95 % accuracy . our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work . for home business , we use pages to do our proposals , bills , and receipts . and use keynote for presentations . one thing that i thought was amazing , is the fact that i can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my powerbook , while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see . for the price of the family pack , we were licensed to use iwork '06 on 5 macs on the same network . the cost fitted our budget perfectly . the only thing i wish was available in keynote was timed transition ( example : after 3 seconds show bullet # 1 , after 5 seconds show bullet # 2 , after 2 seconds show the chart
0	it is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company . i have owned this software for about 80 days . 1 . in 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice . 2 . i have called the 'support ' line 4 times . the minimum time i was on hold was 40 minutes . 3 . my initial 'support ' period is about to expire and i now will have to pay $ 200 to get more 'support ' 4 . you have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device . in summary : the product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them . save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
1	this works fairly well for me . it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money , the interviews are fairly straightforward . however there are a few areas ( like foreign tax credit ) where it should be automated but is n't . but on the whole it does a nice job , they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item .
1	first i would like to state that sooner or later every computer user will come in contact with some problem with an internet security program . they are human made and not 100 % fault proof . i study and work in the it field and was first introduced to pc-cillin through trend micro 's product housecall . soon after i tried out the trial and have finally bought the product . i love it ! i have used several of the other `` major '' anti-virus suites available and have had tons of problems with them . mcafee after one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that i had to completely reformat the pc to gain functionality again . norton to say was n't much better . if you are installing on a `` clean '' pc where these other software suites have not been , i have not had a problem . i have installed/uninstalled pc-cillin many times each time running smoothly . the software has been a valuable asset protecting my pcs by alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were not even on my network but on my isps network . as well as protecting my network from one single computer that received a virus by shutting off traffic to that pc . i can understand where some of the other problems reported with this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just unfamiliar with the framework of the software . but if you already have some experience in how to set this type of software up i really do recommend you give pc-cillin a try . it is a sleak program , easy to install , easy to customize , and really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks and threats . with all its competitors out there i would choose pc-cillin over the rest any day of the week
0	first of all , microsoft needs to come down on their prices ( not that this will ever happen ) . i build computers for a living , and i 'd say that 9 times out of 10 windows is the single most expensive piece of any pc i build . that being said , xp has come a long way . service pack 2 has done wonders for security . i also found it is the most stable version of windows i 've used to date . that 's not to say it does n't have it 's flaws . it still lets in it 's share of `` germs '' , stops responding from time to time ( hangs ) , and it 's very slow to shut down . the built-in cd writing software is terrible and remote desktop is not always a pleasure to use either . however , the biggest problem i 've had so far is with product activation . as a pc technician , i 'm always testing new parts . the most annoying problem i 've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes ( let 's say you replace a video card , a hard drive and add some memory ) all within a certain period of time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time . it makes you call microsoft , where you have to convince the representitive that you 're not trying to steal from them . then you have to read them a long number ( i think 41 digits ) and then they 'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in . it 's driven me to the point of using windows 2000 again to test my parts , even though this is n't always practical for testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel that i paid too much for this operating system .
1	money has built in value for the none accoundant person . with little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time . microsoft has a winner
1	i am amazed what this program can do . it is a big difference from ps 5.5 . it is a new learning curve but well worth it . what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes . amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from . it is worth it
0	i was very excited to get this product . it scans well , files well , is very sexy and promising . then i decided to search for a few files based on my keywords . oooops ! it wo n't search ! ! if you do n't know already , paperport offers you only one free tech support call . after that it 's $ 20 a pop . the rather surly technician i reached had me re-install my program . okay , but it still would n't search . then he told me to un-install windows service pack 2 . uh uh , no way . nada . that 's when i asked for a refund . i bought mycab for $ 40 . tech support is marvelous , within one hour over the internet . the only thing it does n't do is scan within the program , but then i can do that , ca n't i ? ak napa , c
0	i have this program on a 30-day demo . it might be ok if i did n't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried to run the system virus scan , as recommended , but after 3 hours it was only 2 % done because it was stuck on a file it could n't seem to get past . i skipped the file , but then it quickly got stuck again . the `` time remaining '' said it would take 4 days to complete , so i cancelled that scan . it has a learning mode that initally blocks everything . apparently , this program has no brain . for example , i have the live search toolbar installed in outlook . it had to ask me if it was ok to run that dll file . in fact , each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run . do n't even get me started on the quickbooks and internet explorer problems . which is what it would n't let those programs do , even after they had been run and i repeated clicked `` allow '' over and over . twice today it got so slow running ie that it finally crashed the computer so bad that i had to do a hard re-boot . if you have it checking ports on your computer , almost nothing would run or download on ie . so , i 'm going to demo a few more , but it 's probably back to windows live onecare , which i had the past year . it just does n't seem to do much ( no long list of features ) , but it also does n't jam everthing else up
0	i should have listened to the other reviewers ... i wanted to replace my c : drive with a faster one , and ghost 10.0 says it can do it , but do n't be fooled . even if you follow the extra steps from their support site ( which are not in the documentation ) , you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors . it will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site . a friend recommended acronis trueimage which i ended using instead . it 's much easier to use , copies about 2x faster than ghost , and best of all it works . i cloned and replaced c drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems .
1	i found it hard to work with and was disappointed that it was n't more versatile . my needs are not quite the same as a standard business , however , and i have friends with businesses who like this very much .
1	i did n't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files , chart spreadsheets , drawings , pdf documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools , overall this product was fantastic and i can not recommend this highly enough . the interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly . the other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which i use , there is a better edition which is the professional full product of adobe acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade ... ..
0	found the registration number difficult to read . had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time ! the i 's look like 1 's . tried it again ! i got it to load . my computer slowed down significantly ! certain sites i could not access anymore without re-configuring the software . i have used norton . mcaffee or whatever , and other suite type security software . this one was the worst . i would not recommend it . i got a well deserved refund
0	i do not have any recolection of purchasing this product , nor can i find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files . i have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from zone alarm . there is no hard disk no computer file . i am about to raise you know what about this charge on my credit card . i will challenge it if i do not receive for what i am being charged . i will also ask my credit card co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks . in the future i will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet . rehadik @ netscape
1	you can read it before buying the product by looking on the za site . i 'm going to make this hard and make you google it . i 'm not going to criticize anyone except to say if you have a question or problem , the za website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company 's products . there are some compatibility probs for example with yahoo mail beta . as soon as yahoo finalizes it 's mail server za will be compatible . simply switch back to yahoo mail ( pre beta ) . there are several other beta products but generally if you 're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs . za really is better at what it is suppose to do than other products once you have learned how to use it . kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar . i use the free stuff too , and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students , etc . but the za suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who ca n't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway . i know what you 're thinking btw ... but ask yourself `` is your private information , time and computer worth it to you ? '' if so go with zone alarm , learn how to use it and be safer on the net . john row in1ea
1	i first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting lps to cds . after a little research , i decided to try this product of the many that are out there . this software is not expensive and for me , it does what i expected it to do . it is easy to set up and use , and i am using it with an audio-technica pl120 turntable . the first lp i converted was stevie wonder 's innervisions , and with this album in particular , the songs run together , i.e . there is no separation between the tracks . this software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so i could access individual songs . i also cleaned up some background noise with the `` one click '' noise reduction , and the music from this old album sounds great . this is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately i can not compare it to others . what i can tell you is that it is inexpensive , easy to use , and it does what it says it will do
0	the program crashed during setup . when i finally got it installed , it crashed my machine every night until i uninstalled it .
0	if you have not bought this yet , do n't . if you have , but have n't installed it yet , do n't . i 've used quicken for years , and this is the worst implentation yet . the major problem , an issue known to the company , is that reports will not print properly on many printers . wait until they issue a fix before you use this product
1	really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now . the tutorial is helping a great deal . i am positive that i will find all the right buttons
1	microsoft office pro 2003 edition is a good product . it installed easily over office pro 1997 . i have n't had any problems with it ( yet ) . it relies heavily on online links , you probably should have a fast dsl connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links . update : i am using windows xp with office pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
1	great product , has more features then just cd/dvd burning , system backup , numerous audio recording , editing features , lightscribe and it 's also vista compatible . the only downside is it 's learning curve some features and options are complex , but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product .
0	i purchased turbo tax after reading the reviews here ... someone had mentioned a glitch , but someone else mentioned a work around . bottom line , if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop , you 're fine . but if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule 2 business aspects of your tax return , get ready for a huge problem ... it does n't let you back in ! i went to their website where they had both a work around , and a report that if you update your turbo tax ( very easy ) the glitch will be fixed . not so , it did nothing for me . then i tried the workarounds ... i got back in once but the next time i tried to use the work around a few days later , it did not work . i ended up having to call an accountant 1 week before the 17th and thank goodness i was able to get an appointment . also , if you have a business and do n't understand some of the tax workings , like depreciation , it is very difficult to translate your former accountant 's previous year 's work into the new turbotax . it 's not set up that way , so you need to know what you 're doing . i have a college degree and a lot of stick-to-it-ness , but i could not figure out and be sure that i was entering things correctly . and then , it did n't matter anyway , as i could n't get in to change anything in the end . finally , make sure you save , save , save as you go ! while doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already , i logged into their website to get some support . when i `` x '' ed out of the internet page , it closed my turbotax screen that i 'd opened on my computer . guess what ? it was all lost and i had to start from the beginning . that was before i was even impacted by the `` glitch '' later . this program does not remind you to save when you close , or ask you if you want to save , so be sure and save all the time ! so , good luck to anyone who tries this . for me , it was a huge disappointment and i am returning it to amazon for a refund due to the glitch . i honestly do n't know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem .
0	many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third , but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long , is so boring and offers not variety at all . this program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals , and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own . it does not contain essential grammar instruction , it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages ( french is not a translation of english , or spanish , or any other language ) . grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own ; this program claims to help you learn `` naturally '' but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar , culture , conversational structures , and clear understanding , not natural ! for adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts , adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children , sometimes even faster . i do not believe that `` learning a second language like a child '' is an accurate statement to describe this program , children are immersed in the culture , everything around them is the `` real deal '' , not repetitious pictures and recordings . children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly , and adults have greater cognition than children do . looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means , but there is not accuracy . it is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand . rosetta stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences , but i could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated , and overpriced program .
0	i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time . for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware . also when computers come in to be cleaned up , no one uses this program ( even though we 're `` supposed '' to recommend it ) . i would recommend xoft , pest patrol , or ms antispyware much much more .
0	eb own words : `` unfortunately , at this time the britannica software is not compatible with windows vista . we are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on windows vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months . please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the vista-compatible software . but , it is entirely possible that we will not have windows vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software . '' they do not offer a reasonable on-line subscription
1	taxcut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes . i have used it over the past several years . updates are easy to download and the software is great . this year the software arrived on a usb key . this is the easiest and best way to obtain the software . small , easy to store and is reusable . i will continue to use taxcut in the future
0	i use pdfs a lot and i must say that quite often i turn to free pdf software to actually do the tasks that acrobat fails to do . one area i have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so i switch to the free pdf software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use . however if you are a pro pdf maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then i recommend this product hands down as the best one . i just find that it is not always the best pdf software package in the world , but a good one all the same . i would not recommend buying this one just to make standard pdf files alone . if you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right .
1	my 11 year old daughter loves playing this game . graphics could be better but overall it teaches them a lot about horses and how to take care of them . great for any horse lover in your family
0	several years ago i used delorme 's street atlas with a usb gps receiver . the software worked but the interface was lousy . this year i tried microsoft 's streets and trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product ( that 's saying a lot ) . here are some of the problems : 1 . street trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a **com port** . are you kidding me ? in 2007 ? ? ? the delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software , but why is this necessary ? ? ? ( and it was not trivial to get it to work . ) 2 . the handling of pushpins ( identifying spots on the map ) , favorite places , and the like , is extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary to another review , you do n't to re-enter the information each time . you just save the file and reload it . ) 3 . directions are sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone to `` turn left '' if you do n't know which direction they 're pointing ( e.g. , when you 're stationary in a parking lot ) ? much better in such cases to say `` head ne '' or some such . freeway exits ( at least in so . california ) were often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance was identified as a `` local road '' , which at the time proved quite confusing . ) 4 . why does n't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you `` on-route '' once you 're off-route ? you can push f3 , but why is this necessary ? 5 . i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work . the online help was useless . i 'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it , but it should be trivial . 6 . in general , the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together . i 'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it 's cobbled together without much attention given to integration . it 's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it . given this experience , i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around .
1	when i tried this program out , i at first had some trouble running it . but then i went to the website at : www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select easyspeak spanish . they give you a link for the version of flash 8 you need to run . after this everything worked well . while some may have been offended by bathing suits . not me and not my kids . there is absolutly nothing obscene here folks . this program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly ! and it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios . very artistic and fun . you can go to the bank , the hospital , and several different places , learn a new set of words and situations . that you could really use in a foreign country . my hats off to the designers and creators of this program . well done ! ! bravo ! muy bien .
0	i have used this procuct in the past with great success , but ghost 10 is useless . symantec tech support is ( as far as i can tell , been doing computers since 1957 ) the worst . if you get the boxed version it says pc magzine september 2004 `` belongs in every serious pc user 's toolbox . '' think about it using a 2004 quote . in 2004 and 2005 i would agree . the 1st sys i installed ghost 10 is a dell xpx600 , boot disk will not work , backup will not work , blue screen when backing up . tech support directed me to web sites that do n't exist , and the sites that did come up did n't have the files nu tech listed . dell workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor , no games , 15,000 scsi raid , 4gb mem , 1gb nvidia , dual displays -- they crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled . system works 2005 expired i could n't use my ghost 9 backups , and i kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by nu , the systems were shipped to panama and were in customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer , but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me sys works was not up to date i reformated . i purchased ( in anticipation of setting up my computers ) boxed from amazon and download from nu ghost 10 , sys wrks prem , nu int sec ( 2007 versions ) but could n't install them . that was mid december 2006 , now its january 19 , 2007 and still not one answer from nu that works , yes all systems are pluged in to tripplite smart3000rmu tripplite line condidtoners ( 2 batery backup units ) , the computers lived in st maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime . panama weather , people , public offices are great ( driver lic $ 24 lic plates $ 30 for 3 years , st maarten driver lic $ 450 for 2 years , lic plates $ 400 yr ) sailing is better in st maarten . life in panama ( and i do n't speek spanish yet ) is good norton is bad . l read a lot mostly tech books , i purchase tools , electronic gear , software , computer hardware , etc without amazon it would be hard to live offshore , no need to go to borders , amazon is online 24 7 .
0	one thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings . this is my own experience and this may be the last year i use taxcut because of it . first of all , it would not allow me to e-file my state return but did n't explain why . i later discovered that for most states you apparently ca n't e-file a partial year return . then when printing out the state return it told me i had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program . i later found out that taxcut does not support all state tax forms ! i then had to get that form and fill it in manually , and then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains . and there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had . taxcut also advised me i could save $ 1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an ira . so i opened and ira and contributed $ 4000 . when i went back to taxcut and entered the details it told me i was n't eligible for any tax deduction . i was ready to be tied up ! this software is seriously dysfunctional . i 'm guessing by this stage you get the idea . bottom line : i will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year . oh , by the way , if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option , you can get a credit from h by calling 1-888-4taxcut option 2,2,0
1	i needed this for my new macbook laptop that will give me apple and windows on the same machine . the laptop works fine , the pocketbook is thinner . you do what you have to do
1	you can read it before buying the product by looking on the za site . i 'm going to make this hard and make you google it . i 'm not going to criticize anyone except to say if you have a question or problem , the za website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company 's products . there are some compatibility probs for example with yahoo mail beta . as soon as yahoo finalizes it 's mail server za will be compatible . simply switch back to yahoo mail ( pre beta ) . there are several other beta products but generally if you 're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs . za really is better at what it is suppose to do than other products once you have learned how to use it . kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar . i use the free stuff too , and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students , etc . but the za suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who ca n't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway . i know what you 're thinking btw ... but ask yourself `` is your private information , time and computer worth it to you ? '' if so go with zone alarm , learn how to use it and be safer on the net . john row in1ea
1	the fact that they call this premier is a little overdone . the reality is that this is the `` pro '' version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price
0	everything has been said about this product . when it 's working , you 're happy . with my 8 version , almost everything was fine . with the 10 version , it 's a bloody nightmare . i 'm giving up , throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd . never pinnacle again
0	installed this on my laptop and desktop computers . one installation was late in 2005 , the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006 . both have tried to fail . the laptop will no longer do automatic updates . i can manually download and install the updates , but it is a bit of a hassle . the desktop will no longer download the symantec updates at all . i attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls , wo n't do it . the only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers . because of the problems , i 've run into several problems , mostly related to .cab files when i attempt downloads . i 've switched to avg and zone alarm - both free and they work
0	although it says that this works for all versions of photoshop it does not upgrade from photoshop elements . i spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it
1	i 'm not a spider-man fan . i love powers , the ultimates , supreme power , planetary and other stuff by warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending a whopping $ 49 would be worth it . i wanted to read straczynski 's recent run of spider-man , but if i was going to spend about $ 20 on a graphic novel , why not spend a little more for the whole thing . and that 's just what you get . in addition to getting straczynski 's 4-year run ( which includes spider-man 's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up to june 2006 ( which is just like 3 issues ago ! ) . and all on 1 dvd-rom . true , the cons are that when it comes to crossovers , you only get the amazing spider-man stories and reading it off your computer is n't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that does n't compare to getting the entire run . it 's like complaining about getting a free ps3 , xbox360 and nintendo wii , because the box did n't come with it or you 're missing one controller . $ 50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $ 3 now , so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books , you get everything . and it 's true , you can just print out the pages if you want ( so if you want to abuse your office or school 's printer , go for it !
0	darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games . to make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy , basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease , and the darkbasic renderer looks very , very ugly . however , basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with . if you 're trying to get into serious game development , learn c++ and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx , or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source . and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math
0	i 've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in corel draw , the file was saved several times without error , the finished piece is 2.6 gb . i exported it as a pdf that is 4.5 gb . never any errors in corel draw . acrobat wo n't open the pdf . says it 's corrupted . now when i open the cdr all i get is a single page , and when i right click on the file and look at the properties it says it 's 0 pages . i 'm really upset , and now i 've wasted an entire day with corel 's software , if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures corel should warn people on the package . it looks like i 'm sol and i 'm guessing corel will never bother with a reply . hint : i think i 'll switch to adobe . sincerely , waitman gobbl
1	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times . i always shoot with nikon raw format . it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes .
1	this world renown editor is the best when it comes to editing and managing your digital photo
0	first of all , microsoft needs to come down on their prices ( not that this will ever happen ) . i build computers for a living , and i 'd say that 9 times out of 10 windows is the single most expensive piece of any pc i build . that being said , xp has come a long way . service pack 2 has done wonders for security . i also found it is the most stable version of windows i 've used to date . that 's not to say it does n't have it 's flaws . it still lets in it 's share of `` germs '' , stops responding from time to time ( hangs ) , and it 's very slow to shut down . the built-in cd writing software is terrible and remote desktop is not always a pleasure to use either . however , the biggest problem i 've had so far is with product activation . as a pc technician , i 'm always testing new parts . the most annoying problem i 've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes ( let 's say you replace a video card , a hard drive and add some memory ) all within a certain period of time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time . it makes you call microsoft , where you have to convince the representitive that you 're not trying to steal from them . then you have to read them a long number ( i think 41 digits ) and then they 'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in . it 's driven me to the point of using windows 2000 again to test my parts , even though this is n't always practical for testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel that i paid too much for this operating system .
0	since tax cut decided not to produce a mac version this year , i got stuck with turbo tax . their website promises that one may import data from the previous year 's tax cut return . then you buy the thing , and you find out that it requires you to load the turbo tax program and your 2004 tax cut data onto a windows machine , transfer there , then load it back onto the mac for this to work . so , like a chump i borrowed a friend 's windows machine and did all this . but , it does n't work . not at all . and it takes a lot of time to find that out . tried every workaround i could think of . nope . it does n't work .
0	it 's just too complex compared to print shop 21 and as far as i can tell it has very few added features . ray gawronsk
1	i bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in german . he speaks english at home with his mother . i think that this game will help him with his english
0	this is the worst software i have ever worked with , everything is difficult and some things are impossible to create .
0	the product was easy to install but there was a trick i noticed . a day after installing the software i ran full scan . to try the sincerity of the software , i downloaded same free trial . to my chagrin i was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15 . my question now is are all these gimmicks
0	freezes ie 7 and you have to close out and restart ... besides that , the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the `` print as image '' selection for anything that is scanned . overall it is ok , and with the vast price difference with adobe , i can live with it . but , make no mistake , this program is far inferior to the adobe product
0	this product simply does not produce accurate results . it skips entire lines , words on the same line , and misreads even the most legible characters . it came bundled with my scanner , so at least i did not waste my money on it . do n't waste yours
0	no support or response to questions , only 1/2 of the functions work , not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs . try cosmic blobs
0	this lame program is completely limiting . you can not even type in your own text . you are supposed to use the few quotes they want you to use . it is not at all user friendly either . i am so sorry i purchased this
1	it 's quite a bit slower than version 7 . but it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
1	this was given to my son who is going to be living in china this summer and presently knows no chinese . he 's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language . a microphone is a must with this program . only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used , like `` an old man driving a car ''
0	this game can get very boring . it 's very confusing and hard to control . it is sooooo frustrating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the instruction booklet does n't come in handy either . like some other people , i only got rabbits too . i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses . but , only rabbits came . buying this game was a big mistake . it is reallly no fun . do n't waste your money on this game . i gave up about a month ago . i 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since .
1	i put ms works on all systems that i make for other people . it has everything they need , and it dose n't break the bank . the only thing i do n't like is that there is no presentation software , or powerpoint clone . then again , if they included that , ms office sales would go down a lot ! !
1	product is excellent does what it says and then some . instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow ( a winner in my book ) . i had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo i was using in the fact that it did n't have outputs for audio so i was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the rca cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product . i converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software . used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks , actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off . i only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money , overall . i then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3 's with no problem . this is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp 's and cassettes . the sound is excellent on playback .
1	6.6 ultra is an extremely good cd/dvd burning suite . it even has an excellent schedule-able backup/restore utility that burns to disk . do not use the oem version - it 's like diet nero . and do not for any reason get nero 7.0 . you have less than a 50 % chance that it will work at all . ( i am speaking from experience here !
1	easy tax preparation and lots of information , videos , and help . i even bought stock in intuit because i also use their quicken product . awsome products ... no wonder microsoft had their eye on it before
0	i bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it . i have a mac pro running the latest version of mac os . i installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution , which is kind of silly in this day-and-age , but that works ok. what does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes . pretty unworkable . do n't bother buying this for a mac
1	i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers . it helped me see just what we wanted
0	this game was a little too hard for my tastes . despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out . i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back ( all the corridors look alike ) . so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft , gotten caught breaking and entering , been crushed by an elevator , frozen to death and been hit over the head ... i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children
1	a great program . pretty easy to use . you have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do . i bought it usedfrom a list on amazon and it was fine . really like the program . linda j johnso
1	wonderful game a true challange for any die hard friends fan two big thumbs up ! ! ! !
0	all i wanted was a way to identify some files , remember which ones so every time i wanted to backup , i would press `` go '' and the backup would start . alohabob was too `` smart '' for my use . first , it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up . i indicate that i want to select my own files ( which it lets me think i can do ) . then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no , no , no ... it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if i had selected the `` smart find '' . i then manually select my files ( great ! ! ) . in trying to save the `` template '' of what files i wanted to backup , it requires that i make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency ( yuk ! ! ) . i want to back up when i get to it ( about once a month , not when it wants to -- i am backing up to a dvd which i need to put in the drive ) . ok , so now i am over that and the backup begins - great ! ! ! upon returning into the application a month later , i can not select my saved `` template '' to `` run now '' , it will run when it is scheduled to run : ( so ... i need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up . i exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to `` add '' the features i described . oh well - it looked like such a promising product . now i need to find another that satisfies my requirements
0	i bought the mac version of turbotax premier , and i installed it on my mac with os 10.3.9 . after doing my entire return , i clicked to e-file and received a message saying , `` could not load attribute , '' this error box gave me the options to continue ( which just took me back to the e-file page , which led me to the same error message ) or connect to intuit online support . the intuit support site said , `` this error occurs when attempting to file electronically . if you are connecting through a router , try bypassing the router and filing again . if the error persists , it may be necessary to file by paper . we are currently working to resolve this error . . . . to be notified as soon as we have an answer , click here to sign up . '' i do n't have the technical know-how to `` bypass the router . '' i also figured that if intuit had n't solved the problem by march 26 ( the day i was ready to submit my return ) , they probably were n't going to , even if i were willing to hold onto my return until i 'd received word they 'd solved the problem . so i ended up mailing in my return . if i 'd known up front that i would n't be able to e-file , i probably would n't bought the program .
1	i purchased elements because frankly , i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada.i have found it to be pretty intuitive.lots and lots of options as to organization , photo-tweaking and such . i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos . i do have two other imaging programs , and with the addition of elements , i feel like i 'm basically well-set with zillions of options.plus , there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography , and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples , such as `` textures , '' and so on.very helpful . get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program . you will not be disappointed
0	the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was `` off route '' so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
1	i have a question about this . i 'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it . is that possible on this program ? cause my friend has acid pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it 's like $ 400 and i dont have that kinda money . wut i liked about acid pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that , so im wondering if you can do that on this program . if u have an answer for me , e-mail me at peepilott @ aol.com .
0	crashed the system every time i tried to use it ... gave me such a headache i tossed it in the trash ...
1	this always was a microsoft good program , who needs know how be and for where , this is a good choic
1	most of the world still runs on pcs and as a mac owner ( and lover ) , it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting . i 'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio , tv , video games and so on . as a freelancer , i need something to keep track of my business banking , credit cards , expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively , just like my mac . i used myob -- a mac accounting program -- but found it to be tricky and did n't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that i expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours . it could be that i did n't understand the program well enough , but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help , so no thanks myob . in fact , i put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until january 2007 because i dreaded trying to figure out myob again . then i broke down and bought quickbooks for mac . it did everything i needed it to -- a year 's worth of accounting in a weekend and i never even cracked the manual . it allowed me to save the year as a pc file to hand to my accountant on a cd . a few days later he handed me back a cd with a mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent . i ca n't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because i never got that deep into the program , but for my needs it 's right on the money .
0	this program is average to below average in it 's abilities . that said , just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio 's support bites ! you can not contact anyone online or by email for help ; whenever their dis-functional `` web portal '' [ web-based support ] system traps you in an endless loop . i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet . it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access . then burn patch [ s ] to a cd , or copy to floppy/jumpdrive . then `` sneakernet '' the patches to the pc needing them . no more . what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on my pc . [ ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc ] . instead of simply letting me download it somewhere , like to my hard drive , vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc , [ which wo n't work in my case as i 'm not using roxio , nor have it installed on my pc ] ; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process stop/end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page . when you need a patch , all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company . if you want to minimize human contact with customers , fine . but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going . do n't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely to a web server . that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem . it just does n't work . if a company wo n't provide access to patches , even after i have logged into their website with username and password , [ so they know is accessing their patches ] and they do n't offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option , then i sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies . [ though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that ] . when a competitor has a better product , why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality/features , when you can buy the other company out . thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella .
1	this software came with a scanner i recently purchased and i decided to upgrade from the `` se '' ( striped edition ? ) that was bundled with the device . considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value . by simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day . i was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews , but decided with the 30 day refund policy i could try it risk free . i 'm glad i did . the software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye ( and i do n't need or wear glasses ) . i 'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish , but when i scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the ocr worked great ! try it and if it does n't work then return it .
0	i recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive ( hl-dt-st rw/dvd gcc-4482b ( 1.00 ) i have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times . no response . i did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to roxio . needless to say , i am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software . i have a new gateway desktop that came with the above drive .
1	the product works pretty much as advertised and i received it in a fairly timely manner
1	super simple to install , and easy to use . this program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money . i created a `` personal '' account company . it does n't have to be for small business only , but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future . the price was just right for our purpose .
0	there is no excuse for norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as zonealarm before installing the software , especially since previous versions have been compatible . once opened , returning the product can be a problem , perhaps that it what norton is counting on
0	i had a problem at the end of the process in that the program indicated no errors , but when you went to print the return , the message stated that there were errors on the return . i contacted turbo tax directly , but they had no explanation . they simply said that they had received a couple of calls about this problem . that was it
1	this is unbelievable -- -it can tell the importance of the stuff on my pc . and i also can set a weekly backup task on my pc . this is fantastic . it is so straigh forward and easy to use . i will definately recommend this product to everyone i know . well done , alohabob ! ! !

1	inport , excellent job , i love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone . i 've had several hundred lps sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now i 'm rediscovering that music all over again as i transfer the lps to the digital age . the quality of the transfer is very good ( imo ) . for example , i was playing back so . central rain ( early rem ) in itunes and noticed that i had purchased the song on itunes about a year ago . except for an opening click on the lp version , its very hard to tell the difference between the two . my only minor negative ( or really , feature request ) would be for lpripper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that i do n't have to type them all in .
0	i recently purchased an hp laptop that , to my regret , came with a pre-load of win vista . some of the bad things about this package are : 1 . the help files are all on line . if i 'm not connected to the internet , i ca n't access the help files . 2 . hp does ship it 's laptops with the vista install cd 's . instead , a cd to purchase an upgrade to the next version of vista is included . 3 . for the newer laptops , hp is not producing drivers for any other os except vista . 4 . vista is less user friendly than xp or even 2000 . 5 . and yes , vista looks familiarly like os x , but is harder to work with . i have owned several apples and looks are deceiving . just because it looks like an apple does n't mean it works like one . 6 . all of my instructional software no longer works . i use a lot of software to teach information security that no longer works on vista , such as : a. cyberciege ( an information security wargame ) b. boson ccna network simulator c. visual studio ( not everything works ) 7 . also , some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on vista . i do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server . many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their vista support . i could go on but what 's the point ? i ca n't even dump vista to go back to windows xp or even 2000 if hp wo n't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop . linux is out for the same reason , no drivers . so i 'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor . if you plan on purchasing a computer , make sure that if you plan on dumping the os and going back to xp or changing to linux , the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the microsoft vista conspiracy bandwagon
1	4 different methods to learn the language , i am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new . the only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer . just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language . very user friendly
1	these are a favorite in the home . even though we have all of them , they are each different and provide hours of entertainment . skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals . great source of fun and learning . also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game
0	i 've been using quicken for over a decade , and i have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management . but i had no reason to upgrade from quicken 2004 until intuit decided to `` break '' it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features . quicken 2007 for mac 's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version , much less 2005 or 2006 , and is certainly inferior to quicken for windows . that 's bad enough but quicken 2007 is also way less stable than my prior version ( i 'm using the r2 update ) . it crashes frequently . bottom line , intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market . i for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there
1	adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business . it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user . there is , however , a plethora of texts , tutorials , learning guides , and even video 's to help abate the learning curve
1	i purchased this software for my brother to use for his daily reports . he works for a police department and the old documents transferred over quickly and easily
1	i have every single ( that i know of ) math blaster game out there . my kids love them all . i saw this one and could n't resist buying it . my 12 , 10 , and 7 year-olds all play this version . ( it 's too simple for the 12 year old , but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so i 'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills . ) my thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs , and that 's ususally right where they 're at . yes , there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and can not move around ( i do n't play them myself to know well ) but i would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much . i think every family should have math blaster geometry , algebra , and all grade levels . if you can make math fun , and use it as a positive reward ... that is called a `` win win '' ! :
0	after purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my presario running xp home all i get is a message that ssp6 has unexpectedly quite . i emailed tech support w/ the info , but so far no response after 10 days . there is no # to call for support . maybe i overlooked something . also , i submitted the rebate form which came on the package , but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and i need to check w/ them . i did and they said they shipped what vcom had provided them , which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade . not very impressed w/ either the software or the company . would never buy another product from these guys , even when the price after rebate is 0 . lof
0	3d home architect is a complete crock . i have attempted to use it many times . after hours of reading and playing with it i am still unable to perform the most simple task . i own v1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years . i also spent lots of time trading emails with broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and i got nothing . so henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $ . sorry
0	that 's exactly where my cd went . in the garbage . that 's where all the other roxio software i 've ever owned has ended up . at least i never had to spend extra for their junk . it 's always came as part of a peripheral or pc software package . no printed manuals are ever provided and it 's always an issue trying to download one from the roxio website ... which i would then have to print at my expense . i could live with the on-screen manual if the software was n't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support . i ca n't believe that this company is still in business . i guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and pc manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software . be advised ... ... do n't be fooled by their slick packaging and website . read the reviews here and elsewhere
0	this year , instead of renewing my subscription to norton system works 2004 , i thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date . i purchased norton system works 2007 . the 2004 version worked fine for several years , while the 07 version could not be installed on my xp professional pc . the norton `` consumer firewall '' worked perfectly . they make it very hard to get effective help ( unless you want to pay them $ 9.95 per call ) . several sessions on their complementary `` live chat '' system proved useless . in the end , efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend . i returned the product to norton for a refund . their return procedures indicate that i will wait six weeks to get my money back . just wonderful
1	my daughter loves sims so i got this to help her improve her spanish . it is fun to play for adults , too . the complete immersion method is more effective for learning a new language
1	( review written by my wife , the user . ) i 've happily used the quicken checkbook program for many years . when we changed operating systems from windows xp to windows vista , i was unable to get the quicken 2002 version to work in vista , so i purchased quicken basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program . the only feature i use is the checkbook program and as far as i 'm concerned , it 's perfect . i 've never used the download from bank option because i prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives . i use edit preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and i could n't be happier . the price is reasonable , too
0	i am a little disappointed in the upgrade to microsoft office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version
1	we bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year 's old sun to learn how to play because i did n't know how to play and i could n't teach him . as a result of this purchase 1 ) my sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that i could n't imagine 2 ) i ( his mom ) learned how to play too . it is so much fun to learn it that i would recommend it to anybody . it worth it every penny i spent . i like everything about this game . kids will love it 100 % .
0	we purchased this software to map retail locations on a region . it is missing too many features to be usable . for instance , when you import a custom graphic pushpin , the software does n't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program . you can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they do n't resize either . we highlighted our specific region but the software does n't let you print just that region ( called 'territory . ) we searched the help files and their word 'territory ' is not even listed . you can not save your map graphics in any standard graphics format , e.g . jpeg , pdf or ai . we tried printing to a pdf generator , but map point 's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings . after wasting a lot of time , it 's apparent we should have tried google maps/earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works
1	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but i found the new features to be very good . for example ... the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used . it was catching junk from the very beginning , and has missed very few things . i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email . also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version . and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use . installation was seemless . i think it might be a little overpriced , but considering how long i will keep it , it 's not too bad
1	i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product . i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall ( zonealarm ) in my case . that is the only negative i have found so far . the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far
1	i have got a virus that cause files `` comment.htt '' appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus . i tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective . so i try kav and it works ! also kav does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus . autoupdate feature is cool . we do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable
1	works fine . like several other office packages lacks database program , access
1	adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to cs . if you are a quarkxpress user , you 'll find that in indesign cs2 , you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner . the tools and tool palettes are where you 'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen . small touches like being able to save your workspace , like you can do in photoshop cs2 , are great . i tested the integration between indesign cs2 and some of its counterparts in the adobe creative suite premium . i created different graphics in photoshop cs2 and illustrator cs2 and i found it was really easy to import them into indesign cs2 and use . you can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in indesign cs2 . no need to go to another program . with the control palette you can also resize objects too . this palette functions with transform and stroke features for graphics , and it includes paragraph , character and table features for text editing . what the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text . i imported some formatted text in from microsoft word 2003 and two different tables in from microsoft excel 2003 . i was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from microsoft excel . the tables imported easily . with indesign cs2 , you can now automatically style microsoft word files on import by mapping word styles to indesign cs2 styles as well . an issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with indesign cs2 . now , adobe `` bridges '' that gap . bridge now comes as a part of indesign cs2 and the premium suite . so , viewing any adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do . using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well . adobe bridge is a standalone program . being a web designer and using adobe ( formerly macromedia ) dreamweaver 8 , i was familiar with using snippets . these are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else . now , indesign cs2 offers this snippet capability . you can export objects as snippets . these objects can be shared or reused in other documents . simply place or drag a snippet into a layout , and indesign re-creates the original objects , their formatting , and their relative positioning on the page . no more wasted time redesigning , just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit . indesign cs2 also now has an info palette that is just like those found in photoshop and illustrator . size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the info palette . this is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area . it 's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working . sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work , you have to move objects . when this happens , your structure can often change in different ways . indesign cs2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts , pull quotes , margin notes , and graphics to text . you can now precisely control the positioning of anchored objects , apply text wrap settings , and more . as with other adobe products , it is very easy to export your finished work in pdf format . indesign cs2 works so well at exporting to pdf , it even maintains the layers in acrobat 7 . you can pre-define your acrobat export settings as well . indesign cs2 also supports specialty pdf formats like pdf/x-1a and pdf/x-3 , which are used in workflows . it also supports high-resolution cmyk output and color-managed workflows . if you are familiar with previous versions of indesign , the upgrade to the new version is easy . indesign cs2 is even backwards compatible cs . you will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased . loren elks , group manager d-mag.or
1	this software is easy to use . it 's like tax software , it ask questions , you answer . has everything i wanted it for and a lot more . i would recommend it.cheaper than a lawyer
1	i have been using adobe acrobat for a few years now . i 've used both their professional and standard versions . now , adobe has released acrobat 7 . in this review , i will be discussing primarily the features of the standard edition . however , these features are also available in the professional edition . outside of the fact that the professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features , these programs are the basically same . i have noted any features available only in professional in this review . first , what is pdf and what can it do for me ? adobe 's pdf is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - adobe pdf files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security . not only that , but you can share the files with anyone , whether on a pc or a mac . each pdf file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file . the user of the file does not have to have the same font set , nor even purchase adobe acrobat , because the reader version of acrobat is free ! new features in acrobat 7 * turn ms outlook email into searchable documents . this is a great feature . it allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal pdf format . acrobat 's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate . * attaching source files . previously , we have been able to create pdfs from spreadsheet and other formats . now , not only can you do that , but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the pdf ! * improved browser . acrobat 's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier . if you are familiar with the adobe photoshop browser , you 'll like the new upgraded browser in acrobat 7 . * searching improved . the search feature has been improved when you are looking for files . it is easier to search for files , because now adobe has made the feature more friendly . you can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies lan or wan networked drives . more about acrobat although many people are familiar with the acrobat reader program , they are not as familiar with acrobat itself . i consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what acrobat 7 can actually do for their business . just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time ! another great point about assembling the documents in acrobat is the compression factor . with acrobat , users are able to compress the original documents , thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads . this new version can now also create , and save `` pdf/a '' files for archiving and it allows users to scan paper documents directly into a searchable pdf file saving space and time . many companies around the country are making the jump to the `` paperless '' environment . acrobat 7 can definitely help . in fact , i know of an attorney 's office making great use of acrobat . they have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using acrobat because of its form creation , reviewing , commenting , approval and signature features . in paper document storage space alone , this office is saving thousands of dollars per year . even legal documents can be approved , digitally signed and verified in acrobat . anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear . acrobat 's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital ids are terrific ; no matter if you have pdf documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files . for professional users , adobe has added a new feature called e-envelopes . with the new e-envelopes , user can package their pdf files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email . for company networks , adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called lifecycle policy service . the granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing , copying , pasting and so on . many people are also surprised that acrobat is n't just for static documents . users can create interactive forms ( professional only ) as well . in fact , i know a client who is an attorney . they have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using acrobat because of its form creation , reviewing , commenting , approval and signature features . in paper document storage space alone , this office is saving thousands of dollars per year . for cad and graphics professionals who work with 3d files , acrobat 7 ( professional only ) can now convert these into pdf format for ease of viewing , whether in electronic or printed format . this will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3d object in the universal pdf format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file . another feature is the new licensing capability that adobe has added to acrobat 7 . you can install the program and activate it on two separate computers , which is great if you work at home and at the office as well . need to install it on a third computer ? not a problem . the transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer . to do this , deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command . if your computers have internet access , the change happens right away . this feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software . summary i would highly recommend this product to anyone in business . the easy of use and versatility of adobe acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool , whether you are a legal professional , an it company , accounting firm , healthcare company or anyone else in business . this is one investment where the roi will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use . the ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets , paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company . testing setup to conduct tests of the software , the following hardware was used : pc compatible system ( 2 ghz athlon processor , 512 mb ram , 30 gb hd ) epson scanner/fax/printer hp laserjet 8150dn printer for software tests ( conversion to pdf format ) , the following software was used : ms office 2003 ( word , excel , outlook ) photoshop cs loren elks group manager , d-mag.or
0	i have used turbo tax for about 20 years and have loved it . in the past it was user-friendly , efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms i needed - ready to send to the irs . as usual , i purchased it this year . the format changed and is n't nearly as user friendly as in years past . you have to manually select the walk-through feature , section by section and it 's very easy to miss sections . when i got to the end , it would n't let me do a review for errors until i updated the version . but , i do n't have internet at home and could n't update . it crashed my computer 3 times before i skipped the review totally . ( god only knows what else i skipped in the process . ) when i went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated . again , i skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms were n't updated and could n't be used . i ca n't use these . i ca n't send them to the irs . so , i have to find irs forms and manually insert the information myself . so , why did i spend money for the software ? ? why would they sell a product that you ca n't actually use ? yes , it 'll `` prepare '' my forms . but , what good is that if i ca n't print them out ? why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you ca n't use it without contacting the company for another version ? absolutely - run - do n't walk - run run run away from this product . do n't buy it because it simply does n't work . i wo n't use turbo tax again . they have lost a faithful and long time customer
0	systemic mechanic 6 seemed to be helping , since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well . however , the `` repair broken shortcuts '' function does not work properly . for a variety of reasons i use a large number of microsoft word shortcuts in my folder/ file system . system mechanic `` repaired broken shortcuts '' on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target . now i am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which i have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual , correct target file . this has had severe productivity consequences , since i have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut . contacting on-line help was of no help whatsoever .
1	heard other poster said v10 has been available , so searched and found it is true . v10 is available at the maker 's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here . btw , i planed but have n't buy the product yet . but i have to assign a star number in order to post this message
1	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program , it is a must have for them . however the learning curve here is extremely steep . this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale . there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements .
0	i really thought that office was better proir to the whole xp upgrade , but that i will leave to other discussions . this product is your standard microsoft office products . i am fairly sure that most have experienced their products . there are no surprises and the added bells and whistles are n't worth the upgrade unless your are a vba programmer . now , having gone through all of this , i do not rcommend that you purchase this product , but purchase the student version . same product - hugely different price .
1	i 've been using studio for years and while i definitely had reliability problems with studio 10.0 , 10.6 has been very reliable , and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better . i tried premiere elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things , and it was much slower burning a simple dvd image , and it simply does n't do hd which i 've started playing with . i 'm sticking with studio and i make a dvd just about every week with my kids ' videos . i do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean
0	i had two new fully operational g5 computers with panther operating system already factory installed . i was contacted by apple that a new operating system was available , faster , yada yada yada . i took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system tiger . the software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers . i returned them and told them i wanted my mony back . they refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free . the computers never worked right since . we were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet . it was a nightmare as it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc . we were already out a week with down time due to their negligence . when the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system . another four hours standing in line . we got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work . we took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that 's what the cause has been all along . he told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty . if this were the case why has n't it been a problem for the past 12 years ? and what am i supposed to do ? only use the computer in an operating room ? the dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why did n't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench ? bottom line.. i 'm tired of buying new programs and computers that do n't work . tired of standing in line for hours . tired of companies not having a complaint line . how handy is that ? no wonder they keep saying your the first one that 's had a problem with this . that 's literally impossible since i work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers . they all are avoiding tiger because of known problems as well . apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence . instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her i-pod to a bowling ball , they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers . total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00 . i ca n't imagine how much is being lost nation wide . something needs to be done about this . they need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.to add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially . there comes a time that if they ca n't fix them , they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money . we need a lemon law that applies to computers . then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold . i know i ca n't get the money my business had lost back but i want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they ca n't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers
1	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood . much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program . my ear is now tuned to the language . i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses . my vocabulary still needs to get stronger , but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french , that is only a matter of practice with the language . as advertised , this program is painless and progress is rapid . try the demo , you 'll see .
1	i became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business . after weeding through too many option that did n't apply , i knew i just needed somthing simple -- a good way to monitor money in , money out . this program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake . i highly recommend it , as it is exactly as described
0	slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud . went back to free verison
0	cakewalk '' s advertisement saying something like ... '' no experience needed to operate this software ... '' is , in my mind , mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most . i 've had it now for about three weeks , work on it most days , usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it , and still cant get anything out of it . all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work ... blues , pop , country ... .so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up . i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen . beware ... unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed .
0	as another reviewer says : `` but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd-rom package . turbotax instructed me to get them by using `` one-click update . '' well after i update and attempt to restart the software , turbotax refuses to come up at all . '' exactly . i 've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens . i 've used turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this . after spending hours entering in my data , there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage . with four days before the due date , this is disasterous . their support site offers no hint of a fix . mac users , stay away
0	i bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use . i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy ! it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke ! i would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you 're a professional architect/ computer genius
1	i 've only just started . but so far , i am very pleased with this language program . my only regret is that i do n't have enough time to keep at it . the various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program ( aside from taking a class ) that i 've used which does this . i recommend it
1	i think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough , am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program ca n't be beated ... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling , one more thing the mask in corel `` container '' is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks ( u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it ) do you want more i have a lot to mention . am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country do n't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator . i do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid ( first in available in corel ) creating layouts , realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
0	i bought two of the mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed . class . i bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother ( caregiver ) passed away . the storyline of the game is that mia has to save her gravely ill grandmother . then she gets mugged by a rat ! i feel this is a little to noir for small children . the math game ( which i am returning unopened ) is about her house burning down , and if she could prevent it by going back through time . i feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects . i am returning both games
1	i have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software . i appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given . since i am not a lawyer , i am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure i made the correct choices . i did complete the healthcare directive and it compares well with others i 've seen used in my state . i need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask . my only complaint is that i declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so i would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney . it did not arrive in a timely manner and i was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms i wanted the attorney to look at . it is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $ 1000 for a basic package . i decided to keep the cd anyway ( when it finally arrived ) just in case i have a hard drive failure .
0	i agree with others who said it crashes the system . overall , i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth -- even if it were free , it 's not worth all the time and effort . besides all the crashes , downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours . be forewarned . in the end , i returned my copy to vcom , though to date i have not yet received a refund
0	this product offers much to chose from and i really liked the photos . however , i have yet to get this program to work right . i am able to view the photos but when i go into the the export wizard to save the photos , the photo has a transparency over the top of it , instead of in the background . i tried bypassing the export wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving . this also inserts the transparency over the photo . i called hemera in canada and they instructed me to call encore usa in ca for support . encore usa said they could n't help me . encore 's technical support is `` limited to crashes , error messages and lockups '' . i also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or faq 's . there was very little about this software and no help to be found . i wasted my money on a product i ca n't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control .
1	this program does what it says . it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer , so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
0	i bought taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership . for the money i guess i 'm satisfied with the partnership results , but that 's where it ends . taxcut for federal taxes is not integrated with taxcut for business ... ok so what do you want for cheap . but , it also is n't well integrated with the massachusetts state tax version , leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls `` special '' situations ( unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks , for example ) . overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if i override calculated data i can not e-file ( not that i would trust it to e-file my taxes ) . form navigation is hopeless . i can only imagine what someone who is n't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess . i filed for an extension ; now i 'm probably going to buy turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns . with a deep discount , i would probably purchase taxcut again for the partnership taxes , because it is slightly easier to use than the excel spreadsheets i 'd been using ( but only because i do n't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms ) . honestly , you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional taxcut without the overblown , fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads turbotax alternative
0	i `` upgraded '' to norton 's 2006 version of internet security and virus protection software online . included was norton systemworks . i have used norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems . and yes , i always remove my previous version , before adding new software . even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna , it took almost two hours for the product to download and install . then when i rebooted my laptop ( a new high-end sony vaio with windows xp ) , it froze up during startup . i wo n't go into all the hassle involved , but after three removals and downloads over a period of several weeks , it became apparent that there was something seriously wrong with norton 's 2006 product . it caused crashes on almost a daily basis , and updates always took an excessive amount of time . customer service was no help at all , and the company refused to refund my purchase price . i 've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer . after this experience , i will never use norton products again . the only reason i gave this a 1-star rating is because it 's the lowest rating available . it should actually be minus 5 stars for the aggravation and time and money wasted
0	i have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys . they wo n't talk to you on the phone , do n't let you get support until you register your product with a serial # , which , if you lose and need to re-install , you ca n't get without a login and a serial # . that makes no sense . i 've had technical problems with true image home 9 and 10 , and just ca n't get them to resolve it . very unhappy with these guys . the product looks good , but if you have a glitch , prepare to wait a week or more for tech support to respond by email . check out their web site and try some numbers - you 'll find there 's no way to talk to anyone unless you want to buy something . this is not one experience with them . it 's feb 07 now , and this charade began last august ! buyer beware
0	i 've owned this software since it 's ridiculously overpriced $ 500 1.0 inception . even at it 's latest 1.5.1 $ 299 version apple should still be ashamed of themselves . i use final cut studio and own 3 recent macs , so i 've been devoted to apple to say the least . i am a professional wedding photographer/videographer . i have been more than patient with this software . it looks great , up to apple 's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs . and unless you pay apple laughable amounts of money ( much more than the cost of the software itself ! ) , they will not provide support on anything except installation ... even if there software update is the source of the issue . as someone who has been such an apple fan , i feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and download lightroom from adobe .
0	i just purchased the hallmark card studio 2004 ( ... ) . everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card , the first side printed fine , but when printing the next side i keep getting the `` this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down '' . i have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far . i have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed . i am running windows 98se . i will probably be returning this to the store ( if possible ) . it looked to have some nice cards on it , which is basically all i wanted it for , but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer .
1	the only problem that i had , was loading the actual program on the three computers that i have.you had to delete your old norton antivirus 2006 before starting.also i have one more problem that after i loaded the norton antivirus 2007 - 3 users on the last computer i still get a error that i need to down load the latest updates , which i already did
1	my 12 year old daughter plays this game for hours at a time . she is a horse nut and loves it . the player gets to groom , breed and train horses . i would definetly recommend for any horse crazy kid
0	i was a private beta tester for the new os . i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it . if you depend on stability for your existing software , you are out of luck . the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible . many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista . you are better off upgrading to a mac . after all , microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers .
0	do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done -- in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop `` right click '' menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us `` printing '' to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g . through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's `` option '' for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the `` convert to adobe pdf '' button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose `` this feature will not be available '' from the `` microsoft outlook '' option under `` acrobat pdfmaker '' under `` create adobe pdf '' . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used `` convert to adobe pdf '' and `` combine in acrobat ... '' entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( `` adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally '' ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the `` improvements '' in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )
0	i have been using this product now for almost a year . the only reason i insist using it is because i feel really bad for wasting my money . first , this is not worth $ 300 bucks . there are only still pictures and sound . no movies or any fancy graphics , so why the price ? second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences . third , the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all . you keep memorizing thins like `` the boy is under the airplane '' or `` the ball is on the boy 's head '' . initially i thought , well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad . but then i took a look at the last lessons ; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue . i can not recommend you another course because i spent so much in this one that i do not want to try again and get disappointed . do n't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like i was . this is definitively not worth 300 dollars . it is not even useful for basic converstion . i have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library . ah , and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..
1	i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use . reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave . not available in word . i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12. , like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems . the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12 . i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12 . if an earlier version is working for you , i see no good reason to upgrade . b
0	this version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect . microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ( $ 59-79 depending upon timing ) . it is worth the price if you have a laptop . pocket streets is disappointing . by the way , it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so do n't get a ticket ( they allow a normal gps but not a laptop serving as a gps ... go figure ) . by the way , microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price
0	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return , and it calculated that i owed the state $ 550 for underpayment , as well as a $ 230 penalty for late payment . i tried working through the program several times to find the error . i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem , which i was not able to resolve . in frustration , i went to [ ... ] and filed my return easily within an hour , with a $ 140 return from the state rather than a $ 780 penalty
0	i tried to like this product . as previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations . if you only need a 2d floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less . the object libraries that come with the tool - furniture , fabrics , etc . - are really lame . this limits it 's value as an interior design tool . i did not attempt to return it so i can not comment on their return policy
1	this is the most technically excellent racing sim i have played . the physics are perfect , the graphics are pleasing , and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars . the learning curve can be very steep , but you can adjust the ai to suit your needs . you can also turn on traction control , steering aids , etc. , which will get you into the game faster . after a couple months , you 'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven . there is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing . if you want a realistic racer , buy this game
0	turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040a to file , but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region . not only that , but if you have complications with trying to file , good luck . it looks as though i will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed . ttax is worthless
0	i am very disappointed with this product . using the features of it are very difficult ( red eye , sizing , etc . ) in addition , digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen . i expected more from it but have found i have less . i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
1	in my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches . that means books , tapes , tutoring , and experience in a country that uses it . i have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix . i highly reccomend it . if you 're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it .
1	this is a great program for using a bible on your palm . the only issue was that i had to return the first cd for scratches and the 2nd was also all scratched up . it worked but ... .
1	excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use . product well packaged , arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition . scansoft responded with an email in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it 's progress . but you know rebates ... .they take forever ! pdf converter 4 is not my only scansoft product . i also use paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that . my buying experience has always been positive with amazon.com vendors , never a problem . john mc laughlin daytona beach , florid
1	some existing programs , such as norton system works , are not compatible with vista and norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version . other than the compatibility issue , windows vista home basic works fine for me . larry leika
0	unlike versions up to no . 6 , this version require authorization . this means that a single use version ca n't be loaded on multiple computers . adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough i am only using one computer at a time . this version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install . when i found out that my legal version could n't be used , it forced me to reinstall version 6 , this took almost an hour to install , reboot , un-install and reinstall the orginal version . why is adobe the only company that forces this ? their program installation do n't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next . they force you to type the dashes between the numbers . if you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6
1	i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now . i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift . it 's a pretty good method . sometimes a bit difficult to work with , but you do learn some things . i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp . so make sure you have all the right equipment , and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who 's taken guitar lessons .
0	i guess i 'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children . this game has an enormous amount of `` story '' ... it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television . interaction is confusing and frustrating . i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation , which is top notch . i just would n't classify this as a learning game .
0	taxcut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete , nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand . many terms of art are not defined at all . most disturbingly , when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $ 54.95 for both state and federal filing , but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file , the only options listed at checkout time are $ 29.95 for federal and another $ 29.95 charge for the state filing . this bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for h block , unfortunately . i called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $ 5 . i told them that i thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal , and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice . finally , the program crashed several times while i was using it . although the data was always saved , it was quite obnoxious . i run a high-performance , well-maintained mac powerbook , so i 'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly . next year i 'll go with turbotax .
1	it was an excellent purchase . fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality
0	normally i might wait to install a new software upgrade , but i just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use office 2007 with the new vista operating system . i was wrong . you would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software . but after a month of using office 2007 , you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release . microsoft should be ashamed . i do n't know the root cause of my problems , but i have to stress that i am running a clean install of office 2007 on vista , so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues . so what are my issues ? the list is long : -- my biggest concern is that ms word constantly hangs and stalls . it can making editing a document very painful . i suspect the problem is when i put images or visio diagrams into a document . but that is something the old ms word was able to do without an issue . oddly , if i have a colleague open the document and save it out in word 2003 , the problem goes away ! what ? ! it 's killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut and paste from an old document , word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds . and often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire . i keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things . this never happened in the old word . this is another time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me that it can not display my email folders . uh oh ! i have to completely restart my computer to see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess . it is because outlook 2007 does not render html correctly since it uses the word engine , not internet explorer to display email . i have no idea why microsoft did this , but they have got to fix it . -- many of the issues in the old word 2003 still have n't been fixed . if you place an image , it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly . why ca n't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs have the new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 do not . so you have to remember how to use two interfaces . could n't microsoft find the time and money to update all its programs ? give me a break . -- on a few occassions in visio 2007 , my files have failed to save correctly . at first i thought this must have been my fault , but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence . a few times i 've gotten an error message and lost my work . ug . -- word and excel 2007 use a completely new file format . so anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed ( which is n't likely the case ) . to get around this , you can save it down to a 2003 file format , but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format . what a pain ! also , there definitely seems to be an issue with office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could be the cause of many of my problems , but there is no way i can avoid using old files . they should have worked harder on compatibility . there are good things about the new 2007 . i do like the new interface design and the new features in outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar . but i do n't think it 's fair that microsoft released a product so full of serious , serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work . i did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer . surely they can afford to do better !
1	i have tried a few other photo editing products but i always come back to adobe . easy to use and excellent results
0	this software might be recommended if better utilities were n't out there . this one gives the user a sense of security , but when my system crashed , fix-it could n't . i dutifully put in the rescue disk , booted up on it , restored my earlier system , exited and rebooted . nothing . before i 'd been able to get into safe mode , but now nothing . so when i manually restored my system , guess which program got yanked ? and it freed up a lot of system resources , too . ( had i known how much before , that alone would have soured me . ) my system now runs faster and does n't lag while typing . another small criticism : even though fix-it has automatic update for virus scans , i found more often than not i had to go to the vcom site and manually download the anti-virus files . no reason was ever given ; i 'd just get a message telling me to do it . very inconvenient . also warning*warning : this program has strict activation . you can only have it on one computer , so forget putting it on your notebook computer . finally , be careful when cleaning your registry . look at every entry this suite wants to delete . if you run it on default , it may remove critical registry keys and settings . in fact , i 'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones . fix-it has some great features , but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system . ( not to mention the anti-virus problem ) . try system mechanic instead .
1	it is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again . i read them as a kid , but did n't get to read the very beginning . i hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on dvd . i will buy more
1	i have used this anti-virus since 2000 , i liked it then , and i love it now . if your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet , this is for you . it can be a pain on older computers that have less ram , but it still gets the job done . now the cons , i had 3 experiences with customer service , and 2 were postitive , and 1 was negative . i 'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water , although i wanted too . the woman was extremely rude , to the point that i contacted the corporate office . in the end i did renew my subscription . i had no idea how easy it is for exe programs , and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks . this software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed . for 20.00 how can you go wrong !
1	though it may lack some of the integrated tools of quicken or other financial software , ms money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money . particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on-line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs
1	i 'm just learning , and this bible is wonderful . it 's written in language i can understand ( much easier than the king james version ) , and the commentary brings everything into focus . there is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand . the book comes with a concordence also , which is a god-send ( sorry about the pun ) . i 've been so engrossed in reading that i have n't even looked at the cd-rom yet , but i 'm sure it will have great information also . if you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material , this is the right book for you
1	after using 7.0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet . the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous . i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7.0
1	i bought this niv study bible and really enjoy the options it provides : daily memorization . morning and evening meditation and many different ways to `` read the whole bible in a year ... read `` ot nt ps and pr . in a year '' . n.t . in six months '' . `` daily light on a daily path '' . etc . there are many ways to approach your daily study . easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors . i would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your palm pilot .
