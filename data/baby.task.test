0	it 's flimsy ... breaks at the slightest touch ... it 's a pain to open and close ! my 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens ... i found this out when i was putting groceries away ... i went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top ! i ca n't say enough bad things about this gate . it 's worthless . if i could rate it minus stars i would
0	my almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller ( she 's tall , but still gets tired sometimes , especially if i take her shopping ) . i researched the options and picked the maclaren volo . my first stroller before it was chicco capri , and it always bumped against my legs , which was annoying and uncomfortable . when the canopy broke , i got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings . the volo seemed great - light , handsome , convenient , and highly rated by parents . i ordered the stroller and , upon unpacking it , was quite pleased with its appearance . i read the instructions and learned to use it . the stroller seemed sturdy , well-made , and easy to maneuver , not to mention chic . the washable seat was a good idea , i thought . i liked how large it was ( perfect for an older child ) , and how easily it moved . when i took the new volo around the block , i noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly ( one was higher than the other and did not rotate , which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound ) . then the other set stopped rotating when one ( ! ) pine needle got stuck in it ! i had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street . needless to say , that 's not the quality i expected , since every parent i know raved about maclaren . the canopy kept sliding off the rails , as well - something you would not want at the airport , with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow . when i got home , i looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them , but to no avail . they were flimsy ( i could dent them with my finger if i wanted to ! ) , way too small and just poorly designed . i immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to amazon . i was very disappointed . one would think that for such a high price , the wheels would be usable - after all , they are the most important feature of any stroller . i will stay with chicco and order a c6 . at least i know that the wheels are great , and you ca n't beat the price
0	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work . the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed . my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better
0	my wife purchased this toy box at our local toys r us . it went together fine , but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like wet paint . in fact , we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room . little tykes makes this unit , but they were of no help when i called customer satisfaction . they told me just to return it and that they 've never heard of this problem .
0	i bought this carseat ( different color ) because i liked the features . however , everytime i put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward . i have tried everything , from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks , to trying to push the base down so it does n't sit up so high . do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn 's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking . not good graco , this carseat could not have been tested before . i had an evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem . i am truly disappointed . can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away , i am all ears . i know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue . i have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem . help ! ! !
1	used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt . purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here . i liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions . while using the wrap is n't intuitive ( ie watch the dvd ) it 's easy to learn . my back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap ( tummy to tummy ) than in traditional front carriers . i wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise . only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so i have to hold baby 's head while i rock her to sleep . would recommend this product , great price too
0	i 'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product . my wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory . unfortunately , because of the collapsible design this `` bath '' tub does not hold water , it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together . there is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in , but it is useless . the sling is useful for bathing an infant , and the removable ring does it 's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit . unfortunately , by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk . i guess they call it safety 1st as your kid ca n't drown in a dry bath tub
0	i did n't like these for a few reasons . they take up too much room in my freezer . they take too long to thaw . i do n't care for the avent isis pump . i have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and i can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker .
1	my little girl loves this play space ! the colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that i can get dinner on or help with home work . the only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes .
0	i think the floppy seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor , my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area ; this way , i can pad him in and he 's secure . however , i find it very difficult to manage . i see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- i say kudos to her because i find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb . baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other ! the elastic keeps it on when it 's on , but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart ... i challenge you to do it with one hand ! also , i think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous . i am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other ... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out . all of that being said , once baby is properly `` installed '' , it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles
0	i was initially very happy with this product . we purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed . however , the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use . since i liked the product , i thought maybe i did n't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one . it , too , broke ; so i 'm now looking for a sturdier alternative
0	after 5 boys my first daughter just had to have a pink highchair for her princess 1st birthday party so i retired the boys trusty blue graco ( still in great shape after 4 years ) into the basment and ordered this pink one . after what we paid for it ~ i do n't know how to tell my husband i want the blue one back ! ( maybe i can fnd a pink cover ? ! ) my daughter is 12 months old 20 pounds and can not reach the tray without dropping food into her lap . there is a 3inch gap between her the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap . the thick padded seat is adorable comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up . the base is very large her food falls down onto it after every meal so i am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well . the buckles are awkward impossible to do with one hand . if you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you
1	this bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble . it is a great buy for the price . you ca n't go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together
0	the monitor is ok , but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new `` channel '' and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby 's room not on the parent unit ! ! ! also , we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static , broken signal ( only to be reset by changing the channel ) and no signal . overall , i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly ... and i am goig back to my old one
1	absolutely love this product ! ! wish i had had one for my other 3 children . we live in cold and windy north dakota and this is just so easy to use . there have been times my little one has gotten too hot when i over bundle him in it . i recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months .
1	this is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters i ca n't believe we did n't buy it sooner . it 's easy to clean and does n't slide off the chair . our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy . it even has a little carrying bag to take on trips . great vendor with quick delivery too
0	we have switched bottles with my daughter more times than i would like to admit . she 's had gas and discomfort with all of them . i decided to try avent bottles ... i bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas . but they leak horribly . sometimes it 's a few drops . but most times it 's like a continuous stream of formula . a couple of times i was n't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter 's bib , her sleep sack , her onesie , and my shirt . the entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it ... the leak was that fast ! i tried every suggestion given to me : mixing the formula in a seperate container , mixing it in the bottles , and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle ; heating before adding to the bottles , heating in the bottles ; wetting the nipples , not wetting the nipples ; making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring , etc . i wrote a letter to avent and called twice about this issue . each time , the customer service rep spoke down to me and said i must not have read and followed the directions ( which i had ) . do n't waste your money on these expensive , poorly designed bottles ! ! ! these are the worst on the market in my experience .
1	we got this for our cruise and it worked great . it was very easy to carry and load onto the train , bus , and car when it was needed . the material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty
0	in our pursuit for ultimate baby items , the infant carseat topped our list . what 's more important than the safety of your first child , especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving ? our search led us to this graco carseat , and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a christmas gift , just before our daughter 's birth in january . the seat is fairly attractive , but its good points stop there . it 's a bear to install . not because it 's complicated , but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man ( or a woman , unlike myself certainly ) to install the base . we ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might , and then huffed and puffed and told us `` that should be in there real good , now . '' we examined it , and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car , and he replied , `` oh they all do that , that 's normal . '' unsure , but with the safety rating to back it , we continued to use it . throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment . lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat ( we have 3 4-door sedans , a 1992 subaru legacy , an 80-something oldsmobile , and my mom 's 2006 saturn ion . with the seat already in the car , it 's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me . my husband simply ca n't put her in with the carseat already in the car . not to mention that , the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable , with the exception of my mom 's ion , which has the latch system . of course , the drawback of the ion is that my 6'1 '' husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he can not move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard . then , in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we 're driving . literally , go around a curve , look back , and her seat 's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car . my daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat . we 've checked the belts that secure the seat , pulled with all our might , and the seat continues to malfuction . this is a safety issue if i 've ever seen one . with enough force , she could end up directly on her side , say the force of a side impact in an accident . upon closer inspection , i should n't be altogether shocked . the base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits . sort of like a wine glass , i suppose - so it 's top heavy , and likely the heavier the load on top , the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation . needless to say , we 'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately . as for the snugride , i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it . i 'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system , and i 'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system . in hindsight i wish i had shopped around a bit more .
0	i never got to use this sheet . i pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as i 've done with all the baby clothes . i later saw the label said to air dry , which seems ridiculous for something that 'll be washed so often . anyway , it shrunk and does n't fit over the co-sleeper mattress . if you have time/space to air dry it , it 's probably a fine product .
1	i bought this product because it has two most important things i am looking for : portable and the splash guard . my son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last august when we got it . the parts are all plastic for easy cleaning . the cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece , unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment . so that 's very easy to clean . the entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out , no hard to reach spots . the seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best , unlike a lot of potty i found with a circular small opening . the seat can be put on adult toilet seat which i started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl . the only thing i wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl , then that would be even better !
1	we bought this stroller for my daughters : 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds . we were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again . i was looking for a stroller that would n't make my older daughter feel like `` a baby , '' but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall , zoo , park , etc . this stroller was the answer ! the front seat is perfect for our little one . the tray swings open ( and comes completely off , if needed ) to get her in and out easily . i was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because i did n't think a 5-point harness was necessary . the tray is large and sturdy , as is the foot rest . my older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines , but we have absolutely no problem because of it . she walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break . the parent tray is great and something i really missed on our last double stroller . we can store keys , snacks , cellphone , etc. , plus two cups/bottles . the basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access . the side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be . the stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily . it takes very little room to store . the steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push . the stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant . the price is fantastic too . you ca n't beat $ 120 for a double stroller like this ! i wish we had bought this a year ago
1	easiest purchase . just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost
1	hi this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs . some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child . some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over . this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble !
0	i thought this cover was horrible . it does n't cover enough area of the cart . it 's difficult to put on because of all the ties . i could n't even get the harness to fit right . try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic , you can put them on the cart with one hand , and it completely covers the cart , even the big ones at costco
1	i bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles.they were to fast for her .like the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that did n't gag her . great for little babies that ca n't control their flow control
0	every single time , the reading is way low - around 94.9 or something like that . it is extremely unreliable . do n't waste your money
0	i received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is . i have a large baby . he was almost 17 lbs at four months old . so his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age . he also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs . he did n't seem very happy in it . it may work better if you have a smaller baby , but the chubbier ones will never fit for long
1	i bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below , and i was thoroughly satisfied . my only complaint was actually with my luggage , as the handle on my bag was a little short so i had to stoop a little while i was pushing/pulling it . everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever , especially other moms traveling with kids . the strap is so simple it 's genious - just strap on the carseat and go ! it was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security , but everything is a hassle at security . just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it 's fine . this is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze . bravo !
0	we loved this toy when my daughter received it for christmas . she loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself ! this morning i looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty ! the water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections ! it 's not exactly fixable , so we will move on to another crib toy
1	we registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby . upon receiving it as a shower gift , i knew this was going to be great . i love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in . it 's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag . this is a must have for every new parent
0	worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all . i 'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister . yeah , ouch ! ! ! the stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried . i realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think about it . horrible product especially for baby boys .
1	great , safe and nice looking bumper ! i would recommend it without hesitation
1	our second one ( for a second child ) . we use one with a back ; one without . easy-to-use , comfortable , solid . a good choice for a booster seat at a good price
1	i bought the smaller version `` diaper decor '' ( as opposed to the larger `` diaper decor plus '' ) about 18 months ago . although i believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago , i have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local babies r us or on-line here at amazon . i highly recommend the diaper decor . i do not have any experience with the diaper genie , so i can not compare . i have not had any odor problems with the diaper decor . it is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess . my foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers , but this has not been a problem with me . i just open the lid manually and leave it open while i am changing the diaper . i would recommend the diaper decor in the plus size
1	i bought this monitor so i can hear what goes on in my sons room who is upstairs . i have crystal clear reception and i also have another monitor in the house for another room and they never get interrupted . it is extremly sensitive , every breath is heard . awesome monitor , no problems yet so far ! ! !
1	bought 2 different monitors ; this one has great features such as the motion sensor , auto and scan settings . the night vision is weak but daytime looks great . better reception than the other video monitor i bought but not having good night vision is a drawback . i really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom . none of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear . it is the best one that i 've found on the market
0	i love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is . i also appreciate how many colors it comes in . what i am disappointed with is the durability . i have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year . they are totally falling apart at the elastic . now , keep in mind that we use disposable `` chucks '' ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) on top of this terry cloth changing pad . it makes it less messy ( especially early on ) and does n't require washing as much . i also washed them in cold water with baby dreft detergent , hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have . while it is a nice product while it lasts , i just expected them to be more durable .
0	the `` sticky '' pads that are supposed to hold the organizer do n't even stick , so every morning i would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table ... and this was with absolutely no items in it . the organizer does n't come with any information , so i had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not . this is a great idea , but it is very poorly constructed .
0	this was the worst monitor we have ever had , and we have had several with our kids . it says the range is 600 feet , but it does n't even reach 200 . our cordless phone reaches twice the distance . the light makes it very annoying at night . it beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently !
0	i bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats . i like the scalloped edges , the pillow and the colorful pictures , but i am disappointed in the playmat overall . the pat mat leaks so bad that i ca n't use it . the playmat is cute , but it is n't functional , not to mention , way overpriced . the arches have netting which i think freaks my son out . he has never liked this playmat . i have a square one that he seems to enjoy more
0	this was the worst sunshade ever ! ! ! do n't waste your money . it is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all . we used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies . i do not recommend this product . i only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option
0	we can not get the refill bags into our diaper dekor plus . are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit ? the lady in the store said no so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills . now we cant use any of them . what should we do
0	i bought this chair because of the great reviews , i hesitated at spending so much , but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years . pros : i like that i can roll it around to the table , or to the sink to clean up after meals . the height adjustment is easy and convenient . the cons : folding it up did n't quite work as i thought it would . it did n't lock into the folding postition ... and did n't really save that much space . i would prop it against the wall , and hope that no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . the toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son , as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger , by the time he was older , i did n't really need them . the battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it 's been running for a while . he did like it ... but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger . my son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher , so we do n't use that . he 's 13 months now , and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair . i washed the seat cover per the instructions , and half the time did not use the dryer , even though it said it could go into the dryer , and now the seat is bubling and cracking ... i have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son 's legs . if i had not spent $ 90.00 on the chair i would not be as disappointed ... but he 's only used it for 7 months .
0	i bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant . i wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat , watch tv , or drink his sippy cup . this chair was the perfect height , design , and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky . the problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip . the fault is in a joint . i bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when i packed . but then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two . that joint is really weak . too bad ! it 's such an adorable product
0	this thermometer is not very accurate or consistant . whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and i knew that it could n't be right . we would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice . i even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1 ! we got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate . it has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best
0	we received this thermometer as a baby shower gift . for a few months it worked very well ... easy to use . after about 8 months it started acting strange , giving us inaccurate readings . the final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the er at midnight only to find out our son 's temperature was n't even over 100 . the thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital .
1	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons . we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding . they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them , if not a little softer . for the record , we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes . they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting . anyway , i 'm just writing the review to offset the bad review . there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received , and they do what they 're supposed to do -- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table
1	these bibs are the best . my son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out . when meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch . must have for any new parent
1	i am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath , its getting him out that 's the problem . with the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas . personally i think these are some of the best tub toys ! my suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet . you can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler , it also makes a great place to color . be careful to wash everything off before it dries .
0	we bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets . my husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping . i thought i would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast . typical toilet at einstein 's bagels . i had a hard time getting it to stay , lifted my son up and placed him on the seat . he let out a horrible scream and i lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor . he was bleeding . the primo folding potty seat cut him on his behind ! ! ! ! ! ! this product does not fit on toilets , the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him , it hurt him . we will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on . do not buy this ! ! !
0	this diaper pail is certainly the worst i have used . it works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week i was ready to get a new diaper pail . it does not keep oders in much at all , and i do n't even put poopy diapers in it . after about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it does n't do any good . yes , a plus is the using regular bags , but so does the diaper champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this . i 'm definitely going back to the diaper champ ; i only bought this one because it was the only one at my store , now i know it was worth the wait for the diaper champ in the mail
0	i think the mobile is very cute , but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly . i tried attaching it in several differnt places . i am going to return it .
0	i loved the idea that this car seat was . then after i bought it i have had problems with it . the handle realse has broken many times . then the gray handle part has came apart also . this is has not been safe at all . i went to return it and target would not return or exchange it for me . i think it was a waste of money
0	my hsuband and and decided that i would nurse hailey her entire first year . i work at a school and was able to pump twice a day . i did n't like doing it in school though because there was n't space for it . so i would go in my car and do it . all i had a first was the battery pack . i would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week i would loose strength/suction . once i got the adapter i never had a problem again . we could go anywhere and i would always have access to power including when we drove from va to ga. my husband would drive and i would pump . it is great..
0	i love this product in the fleece , but this is so light-weight . it defeats the purpose
0	cons *wo n't stay in place i 've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place ( and baby is out of view ) i even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck . *why a remote ? tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located on the mirror and then if you do n't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride ? *the irritating song too short and plays over and over and over ( teeth gritting ) *learn what ? i 've also noticed in the teaching mode it does n't light up the right item with what the voice is saying . my poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car ... pros *now i have $ 39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds i gained..
0	i hate , hate , hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on . my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying `` here you go '' . it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty . there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning . maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy
0	i thought i would love this but just returned it . it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time ( 10 minutes ? ) maybe i 'm too small ( 5'2 '' ) or my baby ( 5 months and 18 pounds ) is too large . either way i still find the bjorn much more comfortable . i would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the bjorn , but i could n't stand wearing ! very painful
0	we bought this car seat ( and the snap 'n go ) based on good reviews ( not the ones listed here ) . it did not meet our expectations . i give it 2 stars just for the safety of it . otherwise , i have a hard time finding positive things to say . it is way too heavy . our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days , it was heavy to carry around . now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months , it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time . the adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work . on most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop . when you do clip it on to the cart , the front end is suspended in the air . i just put it sideways which is a pain . also , the handle bar is built to be easier to carry ... i do n't agree . it is still awkward- i end up hooking it under my arm . lastly , to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult . you have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release . i 'm sorry that i do n't have any others to recommend . i had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he does n't need the support in the grocery cart -- -that is really the only reason i still use it
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child . not only does it give additional padding that was not intended , nor tested with your safety seat , but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that `` after-market products '' should not be used . it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description
0	avent makes the best washable baby bottles around , so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good . well we were wrong . of the five cups we had , all of them leaked and have since been thrown out . the cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces , which makes them harder to wash , harder to put together , and more pieces to lose . as far as sippy cups go , these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands . we have had great luck with greber 's and playtex 's . please avoid
1	i have had two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that i ordered a babytrend flexloc . at first i was seduced by the high safety ratings , but even after that consumer reports article was rescinded , i still liked a lot of the features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy is twice as long as my evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely - the canopy stays in place ; it does n't fall forward or backward behind the seat - the tightening mechanism under the baby 's feet is easy to reach and very easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing - the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust ( the shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible . the flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn -- it 's a breeze . - the seat can be transfered between cars without the base . it can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the latch system if your car has it . - the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position - this carseat is lighter than my evenflo - the cloth is very wipeable , not as absorbant of spills and stains as my evenflo cons : i found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat , and one that might ( depending on how i can resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - the release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat . it 's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing . - as others have said , the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff , but not horribly so . i was prepared for them to be way worse . - the handle is thinner and does n't feel as sturdy as my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it has n't had any problems -this is the one big one that i have to check with babytrend on : twice when i have turned a corner sharply , the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle ! i have tightened down the seatbelt as much as i could , putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i 'm still not doing it right . the base is narrower than my evenflo 's was , so maybe that 's why ? so i need to contact babytrend and see if they have any suggestions . until then , i guess i 'll take the corners slower ! overall , i have felt like this seat was a major improvement over my evenflo and even over the graco snugrides i checked out at the store . it was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows . i would recommend it for sure . just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the latch system if you have it
0	like you , i read all the reviews i could of bottles , travel systems , baby swings , cribs , etc etc etc . i loved the shape of these bottles ( very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding ) , and the concept of the `` ventaire '' system made a lot of sense ! however , 2 months into using these bottles , i became fed up with having to wash all of the different parts , drying them thoroughly ( it 's a must with these things ) , and having to `` activate '' both the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal ; wasting valuable time and energy that should 've been spent with my family , catching up on laundry , cleaning the house , cooking , and grabbing naps in-between ( i also work a full-time job and did n't get home till 6 pm every night ) . the worst of all of it is that if you do n't install the vent juuuuuuust so , it leaks ... the person ( below ) who said it does n't leak if you screw it on right , has n't met me - i 'm 34 years old and do believe i have learned how to screw on a stupid cap ! it 's a `` hit or miss '' deal ... sometimes i would go a whole week without a leak and then out of the blue ... water everywhere ! ! ! ( and they 're slow leaks too , so it 's not like you would notice right away ... it took like 30 minutes before showing ) then i called playtex to ask them what the problem was , and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material ... so , they kindly sent me some new ones . well , yeh , that did n't work either ! ! ! it is a great idea , but very bad design ! ! ! i finally threw my hands in the air ... and purchased evenflo 's version of the `` angled bottle '' and now i am in heaven ! ! ! do yourself , and your time , a favor and do n't waste the money
0	did not stick to tile . sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner
1	i 've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason i 'm still nursing my little girl . i went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day . at first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session i was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast , suction is n't enough . then i got the easy expression hands-free bustier which has solved that problem . i can now do e-mail , talk on conference calls , etc . while i 'm pumping so i do n't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk . i 'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer medela bottles into the small cooler , with the ice pack so i do n't think the cooler is too small . also , i do n't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack . if you do n't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there 's no problem with storage in the backpack . i also reccomend the medela micro-steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work . also , i do n't think the suction is too hard ... yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced , but it is by no means painful . pain is what i experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth !
0	i just bought the knobs and they are terrible ! ! ! ! i have so much trouble opening them . do not buy it ! ! ! ! it 's a waste of money , it 's better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it .
0	this product is a good idea however : 1 . the fill hole , is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray . 2 . ca n't be put in the micro . 3 . extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean . 4 . extremely hard to open and close ( i and my daughter have to use a butter knife to pry open ) . 5 . not good for a grandmother 's hands that has joint problems . 6 . does n't keep food warm for very long . perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product
0	i bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the `` tear resistant '' cover material . all she does is sleep on it !
1	this mobile is amazing . from the time she was 6 weeks old , my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music . she loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile . although it can be noisy , it does n't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds . a must for any nursery
1	i purchased this item ( not from amazon ) and my child loved it ! the puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great , not the usual 'kid-drivel ' that usually is part of any kid item . some hbb 's come with contemporary music and i will be picking up one of those soon . highly recommended
1	these are the greatest invention in bottles ... ever ... ..these bottles helped my daughter so much ... .no more gas , no spills or leaks ... the only downside is they are hard to clean..but who cares ...
0	i wish i would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these are flimsy , thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter . i 'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad . fortunately there are other products that work better ... if this was the only option , i might as well not have a sheet on at all .
1	just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and `` practice '' . so far so good ... ...
1	i was given these wall hangings as a present . i love them and they make the room look great . we also were presented with the problem of how to hang them . there is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back , but that seemed too complicated to deal with . therefore , my husband and i attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top . my husband then used a finish nail in the wall , and used the safty pin to hang over the nail . the pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on . it was easy to do , and the wall hangings look great ! i thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight , but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed . i hope this helps others with this problem . i still wonder though , why on earth the company did n't foresee this problem in the first place
1	a good friend has this for her daughter . i fell in love with it when i saw it . completely adorable and works like a charm . bought one as a baby gift as well , but i 'd kinda like one myself ...
1	we have the one with brown trim , but i had to write a review here too because we just love this blanket . it 's super soft , the perfect size for swaddling , and nice and light and still warm for baby . we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son , but does n't cause him to wake up sweaty . it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it 's completely worth the money ! i 'd buy another in a second
0	i loved this mattress pad when i first opened it , it 's made of soft , natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby . however , after washing it , i found it 's too small for the crib mattress , which is a standard size . i think they just skimped on material , or did n't pre-wash . it 's a good 2 inches too short ! it does n't have much stretch to it , so i 'm afraid i wo n't be able to use it all ! very disappointing
1	my daughter plays with this toy at grandma 's house . theses `` instruments '' are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with . the bright colors and different noises definitely interest her . she loves to shake them and make noise . they are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you 're on the go
1	i just love our snack trap cups ! my 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys `` doing it himself '' . they 're great for shopping , driving , or anywhere ! absolutely no spills ! highly reccommend this product ! -happy mom of 1 so fa
0	i was so excited to buy my son a potty seat . he is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months . he picked out the pooh and loved it and i love the splash guard . unfortunately , the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor . he is not leaning over to the floor , the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor . this seat is quite tipsy
0	i received a swaddleme as a gift . the first problem i discovered was that even with the small size i had received that when i wrapped it around my son , the velcro pieces did n't meet . in other words , the wrap was too large . i attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight . the next problem i ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby 's feet like a womb , my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed . in fact , he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top . a friend recommended the miracle blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it . it is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well
1	i bought these strap covers : 1. because my daughter 's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her snugride , and 2. because i could get them in pink and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time ! this product solved both problems . when i took them out of the packaging and realized how big they were i was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft . luckily , she adapted easily to them and i think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat
0	do not order this item ! i ordered and returned this item four times due to cracked pieces . storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage . i refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture . what a disaster and diappointment
1	i used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son ( that does n't overlap the mattress ) and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times . i remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that i was panicked and thought he had suffocated . i was extremely happy when i discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed . she is now two and i have n't had one problem with it . i at one point had three on her bed . i went down to two as i pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open . i have not had one problem with them . i take them off her bed and use them when we travel . i can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween . i wish they had these when my son was younger :
1	b.o.b . rocks . bob is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use . we 're a little attached to bob in our house . let me tell you the revolution is the stroller to get . we bought it right after our baby was born , choked up $ 40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since . even in the mall , department stores , etc it 's great . baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it 's agile and almost effortless to push . i see hundreds of bugaboo strollers around and i must admit they are nice but b.o.b is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him . our other seldom used stroller is a graco something or other and i do n't even know where it is . however i 've used it enough to compare it to bob when collapsing it and putting it in the car . i must say bob is easier and faster to fold and go . one downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers . however , bob is built like a tank . we travel with bob a lot through airports ( yes bob fits through most airport xray 's while normally collapsed but sometimes i have to take off the back wheels which is easy ) and we hang stuff off of bob 's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car . our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller . this get 's interesting because i do n't see us doing the duallie bob revolution since it 's a no-go in the mall , target , etc . the phil ted 's e3 buggy and double buggy are looking tempting but i do n't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. they ca n't see anything . what i wish b.o.b . corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the phil ted 's ... .. but a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet !
1	i am so greatfull to this pump ! i was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each , while working full time , taking vacations ( without the kids ) , etc . i also have the car adapter which is awesome , i was able to pump to and from my work , ( which is over an hour away ) , while driving . i only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros ! the warranty is only good for a year , but mine is now three years old and still going strong . we are expecting our third child and i hope my pump holds up for another year , if not i will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one ! best of luck
0	i 've bought this tub thinking that i can just fold it up and store it under the sink . but that 's not how it works . it take many steps to fold and unfold it , one of them ivolves inflating the seat ! the mechanism for snapping it in place when it 's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times . also , the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things , probably not very pleasant for a little baby . i am returning this item
1	my 6 month old got these for christmas . they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in . she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg , but it broke . i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite . they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks
0	this was way too quiet , even on it 's loudest setting . my infant did n't benefit from it at all . the sounds are fine , and not too repetative as with some machines , but even in a small room ( really small ) i found it too quiet to be effective
1	we originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house , and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much . but , since my 2-month old still `` lives '' in our room , in her bassinet , that part has not yet been an issue . however , we keep this basket in our living room , fully stocked , and we do n't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper . ( sounds lazy , but if you already have kids , you understand ! ) the sides of the liner have pockets , which we use to hold hand sanitizer , diaper rash cream , a thermometer , baby brush , aspirator , baby nail clippers , lotion , a couple rattles/toys , and some chapstick and nursing pads for me . we put the diapers , a changing pad , and a wipe holder in the `` main '' center part . i also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle , and my baby loves to look at them while she 's getting her diaper changed . ( i put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them . ) the basket itself is well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart any time soon . ( in fact , we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers ! ) we have not yet had to wash the liner , but it appears to be well made , and i have no fears of it falling apart , although i am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle
0	i thought i would love this , but it just takes too much time and energy . germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva . then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then i put it in my car etc . i just do n't see the difference in that and not using it . my hands touch it , baby 's hands touch it etc . i have enough to keep track of with a bag , baby , wallet , cell phone ... .i just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material ! my grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and i wipe down the handle bar ... .that is far more effective against germs . you are better off buying a $ 3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky , ineffective cloth
1	i own this seat for my son who is age 6 . it is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8 . the seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable . the headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck . the price is decent too . the only issue i have with this seat is the cupholders . if you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car , the cupholders are n't very usable . additionally , the cupholders do n't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat . personally , i leave the cupholders pushed in . i have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat . i wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such . furthermore , with booster seats in general , i think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat . my son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium . i would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the latch loops for the older child . not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side . as far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt , this is a nice option .
1	this is a thin sheet but it fits my full-size pack n play bassinet perfectly . i would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often
0	i have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time i reached home .
1	i shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach , for my sons first visit . i found this one , and let me tell you , it was perfect ! it was so easy to set up and take down , and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds . i saw a lot of other tents/cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best ; both price and durability wise . excellent find and buy
1	i wanted to respond to the other review . if you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere , please know that the curtains are a darker stripe ( not the tan plaid ) . but they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker , the border on the wall hangings and quilt , the trim on the hamper , etc . it is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern
1	our son has an especially strong startle reflex , and has to be swaddled to sleep , at all . at 2.5 weeks , he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did , no matter how expertly done , no matter what blanket we used . so , at 1 hour of sleep , he 'd start crying and we 'd have to go in and start all over . we searched online for actual `` swaddling '' blankets and based on reviews , chose this one . what an utter miracle . we are in such debt to the dad who created this ! our son is now 12 weeks old , and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep . he was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks , and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks . we would never have this success without this blanket . we 've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it , but his reflex is still so strong that he needs it . it took a little `` getting used to '' the method to get him wrapped up , but in no time we both were experts . and the price on amazon , with free shipping , is way better than what we paid directly through amb . i wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents , especially new parents .
1	when i was looking for a thermometer for my baby girl i wanted something easy so her father could use it and fast because shes one not to stay still very long . i found this one and fell in love with it . i use for it for everyone in my family . yes , i did have a problem finding the covers but that 's not a reason to not to get this thermometer
1	i am not an expert in anything . i am an emergency room nurse though , and i hear stories of babies dying from sids . we thought we 'd try this product as the reviews are great . we love it . the sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration ! i would highly recommend this for every baby , as sids is a risk up until 12 months of age . i feel so much better , knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing . we plan to take this with us when we travel . it is easy to use and it really works . if you buy the one with the two parent units , you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead , or as well
0	we bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents . however , he is a very large boy ( 35 '' and 34 lbs ) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably . so we took off the tray so he could sit at the table , and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food . we went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy . we use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable , but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food
1	i loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart . the velcro worked really well as it gave `` room to grow . '' swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two , she just totally outgrew this . it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift
0	i 've heard avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself . i just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and both link . not just a littler either but with every use . my daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases . i find this odd b/c the 6mths cups do n't link at all . i think these products are very hit or miss . you may get a leaky cup or you they may work great . ?
1	no more worries about being too short and missing the bowl . yea ! ! !
0	unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub , this wo n't work . the side pad wo n't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat wo n't go deep enough . too bad . it looked great !
1	this seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean . i am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads . it 's almost porous ! if you get this changing pad , plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean .
0	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it . i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing , and now it is starting to fall apart . they just do n't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure .
1	i love this bra ! i have 2 , so that one is always in the wash . it is the most comfrotable thing i have ever put on . i bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in . it was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra . i felt so much better after i put it on for the first time . i felt like i could breathe again
1	this bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed . it feels so good knowing he 's so close . its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps . oh yeah , and its really cute
0	unfortunately , despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway , i have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards . it was not sturdy at all , returned it
1	i bought this sheet for my graco pack n ' play and it fits great . it 's very soft and looks great wash after wash .
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement . i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt ( i have a small frame and it is big on me ) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done . very friendly , amazing customer service , that 's hard to find these days !
1	love this tub . the hammock attachment works well for small infants
1	i got this for my baby girl and both she and i love it ! ! ! she does n't slip and it is really comfortable for her . she really enjoys bathtime . and , if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby ... you will really enjoy it . i wanted this prior to my baby being born , but i read some of the reviews and i did n't buy it for her . after the first month of her using another tub , and having trouble with the product , i decided to buy this aquarium tub that i wanted in the first place . caution : please use the hammock as directed for your baby 's size . this tub is perfect if you do that ! the reviews that i read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when i actually read the directions before use . please read the directions . both you and your child will appreciate that you did
1	we really enjoy this travel system . having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car . being off of work for 3 months , i did n't have to feel cooped at home when i could easily take my daughter to the store or the park . as big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers , we still prefer to take it , because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath , the seat-back folds down ( allowing sleep or diaper changes ) , and it has three cupholders , 2 side pockets that can hold other items ( burp cloth , bottled water , toys ) , and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone . the basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot . the stroller fits in the trunk of our compact saturn 4-door , or if necessary , in the front passenger seat ( upside-down to fit in the wide wheels , which are anyway relatively easy to remove ) . the loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand , so i can push it if i happen to be carrying my daughter . the stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street , on paved park paths , and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach ( it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand , if you go backwards ) . in her car seat in the stroller , she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies , although i found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow . we took the whole system on a 10-day trip , which included a flight out of town , and i felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born . at 6 months , she has just outgrown the car seat ( but she 's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight ) , but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up . drawbacks , all fairly minor : not easy to close stroller one-handed . wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top , so i 'm always banging the wheels on something . it takes a few minutes to remove/replace washable carseat cover , but this is probably necessary due to the straps . as with any carseat , we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car ; we had many questions on installation , particularly since our car lacked the latch system . we purchased a second base so we did n't have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter 's car
1	absolutely love it , and it 's a great quality too . for this price ? ? ? ? i just ca n't believe it ! !
1	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old ; she 's now 2 1/2 and we 've never had any problems with it . this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall , park , etc . the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too . we 've never used the rain cover , so i ca n't comment on that . it does n't have a storage basket , but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do . for longer trips , we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option . i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light `` quick outing '' stroller to keep in the car .
1	i bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great ! now i do n't have to switch the whole seat when mom takes the baby . i am very happy with this purchase
1	this item is a godsend and one of the most useful things i received ! i can not imagine my day without it ... my daughter loves it !
0	while sometimes this works well , i 'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that was n't there when i went to bed . it does n't matter what channel it 's on . i also get a random drumroll sound frequently . if you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap , then i highly recommend this
1	i think for your money you get a great value for this playard . it comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this . it also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with . the mattress seems very comfortable and i bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others . it has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops . the mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars
0	i bought this chair because of the great reviews , i hesitated at spending so much , but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years . pros : i like that i can roll it around to the table , or to the sink to clean up after meals . the height adjustment is easy and convenient . the cons : folding it up did n't quite work as i thought it would . it did n't lock into the folding postition ... and did n't really save that much space . i would prop it against the wall , and hope that no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . the toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son , as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger , by the time he was older , i did n't really need them . the battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it 's been running for a while . he did like it ... but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger . my son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher , so we do n't use that . he 's 13 months now , and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair . i washed the seat cover per the instructions , and half the time did not use the dryer , even though it said it could go into the dryer , and now the seat is bubling and cracking ... i have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son 's legs . if i had not spent $ 90.00 on the chair i would not be as disappointed ... but he 's only used it for 7 months .
1	i like this because it is a nice construction . i bought the white and it blends in nicely . i just wish it was a little higher . we have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now .
0	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago . a week ago it just stopped working . i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore . so i went out and bought the exact same steamer . i used it for 2 days and then on the third day , yesterday , it would n't turn on anymore . i 'm taking it back today and getting something else
1	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front . i broke down and bought this . this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty . but it 's beauty is its simplicity . he is able to sit and do his business , carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself ( he was not even 2 yet ! ) . i would highly recommed the potty training book `` potty training in less than a day '' . it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on [ ... ]
1	the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful . . . animal images are unusually cute . i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall . the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up
0	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range . well , i have problems similar to sara 's . when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps , i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used . when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear . that 's why i gave it a 2nd star . this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor
0	do not like this product it is very hard to get rail under bed pops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac
1	i am a new grandma . the size and portability are a plus . i was surprised that it came with a mattress . i had n't read that in the description
1	i bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down . i loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it , as a friend told me so i gave it to my mom to use . i knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones . i am a very price sensitive , i shop at consignment shops , etc and i still feel the money spent is worth it ! the reason i like this stroller : 1 . you can guide it with one hand . 2 . there is a spot for bags , etc underneath . 3 . the cup holder for mommy and child . ( this is an extra accessory ) 4 . it 's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily . 5 . the five point harnes
0	these breast pads are sooooo different from the johnson johnson product . they do n't absorb your milk , which means it still gets all over your clothes . the do n't have adhesive , which means the pads move all over the place . generally , just a waste of money . you might as well use toilet tissue : ) .
0	i purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago , and i have used it all of two times . it creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted , and i really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized . i am terribly disappointed with this product , and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind
1	this sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty on those cold san francisco nights . it is really easy to use to move from the carset to the stroller . i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides , but it 's the best thing around we 've seen .
1	this is a good quality item for the money . i love that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets . i just bought a second one for grandma 's house !
1	my son was a very fussy bottle eater . he would never finish his bottle until i switched to a faster flow nipple . now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater . he became frustrated that the milk was n't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect . he is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed . now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
0	i ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken . the first two times i ordered it through walmart.com because it 's cheaper , but they would n't replace the part . the third time i ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part , but i 'm still waiting on it . this is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set , but it 's a major pain . i originally ordered it in july and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months . my son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser
1	i bought this pump when i was going to a concert and knew i would need to pump while i was out to avoid discomfort and leakage . this pump fit in my purse and was easy to use . i just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped . it was silent and no one even knew
1	i love how wide they are . this makes them much easier to clean and to handle . since they are shorter i can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when i use the stopper caps on them . i can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short . my baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles . her arms do n't have to stretch as far . i have n't had any real problems with these bottles . i was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem . i went ahead with them because my sisters said they did n't have any problems with them . they have leaked twice but only because i did n't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet . any bottle will leak if you do n't screw the lid on sufficiently . i have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when i watched my twin cousins . we tried three different brands and were n't ever really happy with any of them
0	how annoying to pay $ 25 more here than at walmart . same price at babies r us . is it really the same exact thing ? very frustrating .
0	this is not a good product unless you 're willing to screw one of the parts into your door , which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door ; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so . as a result , the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off . you ca n't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person ( large or small ) trying to open the door . it just is n't going to hold up . it 's a nice try , but in the end was a waste of my money
0	i bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car . i thought the lights and music would distract him . after about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing , i have decided that i would really rather hear my son cry . it is far less irritating . the remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work . what genius engineered that ? also , it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes . do n't waste your money ! !
0	i agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had i come to amazon first , i would not have wasted my money . i got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and , being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight , he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove . so we got and installed these covers . within minutes he discovered them -- and became even more fascinated with the stove ! he immediately began spinning them around on the knobs , and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward , the cover and the knob come right off together ! now he had a fascinating new `` rattle '' to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain . our solution ? we took the real knobs off the stove , period . we keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook . as for these clear covers , they 're are still in the closet -- maybe i can use them to display insect specimens or something ? useful as knob locks they are not
0	do n't waste your money on this high chair . by the time your infant can safely sit in it , they will have almost outgrown it . you 're just paying for the name brand , not the quality . stick w/ a graco instead
0	an ok gadget , but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well . it does not have an automatic shut off , so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil . must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this
0	i thought this product would be helpful for sleeping , since it was recommended from a friend . however it does n't work for me . i took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag . after trying it for 5 minutes i decided that i did n't like it and tried to return it . the company would only issue store credit because i `` opened '' it . what a rip off
0	the product is flimsy , the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on , the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine , and the seat is too large for a toddler . my child does not feel comfortable using this potty
0	i bought this for my daughter and i too had one light that worked , my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work . i am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus . my daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on . needless to say i am very disappointed with this toy
1	the fabric is soft and cushion , and what 's most important it provides good support for my baby . she loves it
0	i really thought these were the cutest bumper pads , but after hearing over and over again how you should n't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication , i decided it would n't be worth the risk to put them on the crib . i do n't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one , and even if there were i would n't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them . she has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these . again , cute for the nursery set up pre-baby , but i would n't use afterwards
1	my daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks . she got very used to being swaddled , but after 4 kids i still can not do it right . this blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old . when both the blankets were in the wash she would n't sleep that long . she was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held . thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep
1	i will admit that i had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way ( boiling water in a pot on the stove ) so when i saw this product over seven years ago i bought one immediately . i loved that it was so effortless ! pay attention to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage . no one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child , so read the instructions . i also purchased another when my second daughter was born because i gave my sister the first one . my only issue is that because of its small size ( it has to fit in the microwave after all ! ! ! ! ) , you have to really stack the bottles , nipples , etc . in a way that utilizes all of the available space . once again , the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack . so , if in your sleep deprived , hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache
0	even though it comes with instructions , it is way too complicated to use . i was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing . not to mention , it shrunk 2 feet after i washed it ( following the instructions , mind you ) . now i have to tighten it in the back versus the front . it 's now destined for the donation pile . the baby bjorn is easier to use .
0	my son hated this mat at first , then he played in/with it for about 5 days ... after that , it got old ! mighty quickly . my son is now about to make 5 months old , and he does n't even want to look at it . waste of money for me
0	i was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training . well i opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment ! my son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time . it 's too small and pinches . i tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable . no positioning worked . if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it , otherwise , skip this one
0	this was the second pump i purchased . i was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand i bought . this pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the ac plug in is much weaker than the other side . the motor died out after 2 weeks of use . this pump is not meant for everyday use . i just bought a medala and i hope to have a better expeirence with it
1	i bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son , and we never had any problems . easy to clean and firm ; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months . when we were surprised at the news of a second , i bought this from amazon on sale -- the fabric design is different ( blue and white checks ) , but otherwise it seems the same to me . but one comment : if you do n't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $ 20 . it depends on what you 're willing to pay for convenience
0	i bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it does n't fit at all ! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but do n't get it for travel as it does n't work for that
1	this pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited . i even use it at home when just watching television . it creates a natural relaxing position , it is a must have
0	i got this as my older son , 8 , had the regular type of wedge . this one does n't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back , nor does he stay at the same height on it . every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges . this to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard . i was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it , but have been very disappointed with it 's performance . also , the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month . there 's an indentation where i laid my son .
1	so many convertibles car seat to choose from but the britax marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum . i was very pleased that the marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness . no other seat that i reviewed offered this feature . i also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap . my son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his peg perego primo viaggio . ( ... ) they offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color i wanted in stock . i believe i made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments
0	the thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper . but it is very blunt ! ! ! and the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible , unless baby 's nail is very very long . if i wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing , my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head . i end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy . that worked much better .
0	there was a crack down the side where it was put together and nicks in the wood . we did n't have time to send it back and they only offered us 20.oo for a discount . very dissastisfied ! will never order form here agai
0	i chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews , and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks ... no leaks ... they worked well , until recently . my son is 4 months old and they all leak . constantly . i fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it 's empty . they are n't very durable , the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now i 'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take ( i hate the liners ) ... and they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all . do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months
0	we received this toy as a gift when our son was born . it was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries . when i went to put it back onto the crib , i noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break . i need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all . also , like other reviewers have stated , the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that 's when my son started interacting with it , so it 's a little age-inappropriate . i contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement ... i 'll repost if i hear from them .
1	this product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home . while others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes , i found that i could keep it velcro 'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom . my daughter really liked this , but quickly outgrew it . at just one month old she did n't want her arms tied down , so the usefullness of the product is limited . for a baby who loves being swaddled , this is an indispensible item . i 'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs . you never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled
0	the freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea , but the plastic is very flimsy , and when set in place , it just barely reaches the floor . it 's a pretty unstable situation . a separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better
1	i tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us . we actually came across them when walmart stopped carrying the parent 's choice anti colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design . these bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she 's feeding . this is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth . she also has reflux . i ca n't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds . however , i have to think they 've helped a bit . they are also comfy to hold for me . i 've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking . i had this problem once and that was because i heated the bottle with the valve system in it . so , i learned to not do so and have not had a problem since . they are a bit pricy , but i believe that you get what you pay for . lastly , i do n't think that the small parts are difficult to wash . yes , it 's a bit more time consuming if you do n't have a dish washer , but for us , it 's been well worth the extra time
1	our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it ! it does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys . the sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub . easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or i need to use our regular tub
1	i love this shade ! i am the mother of 2 girls , alice 7 and samantha 22 months . i never had anything like this for my oldest . it makes such a difference . the little one wo n't go out without it ! even though i always used sunblock on alice , her skin is still so much darker than samantha 's ; i really believe it is because of the shade . i looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and i think it is the best one on the market . the others are made from nylon/lycra and i do n't think that would hold up as well as this one does . thank you protect a bub
1	these wall hangings are lovely . the different textures are very cool . maybe mine were different than everyone elses , but they came with little ribbon loops on the back , and i do n't get why there 's an issue hanging them . they 're very very cute , and look adorable in the room .
1	i have n't been able to find the sizing info . for the sleepsacks on this site , so i called the right start ( they also carry them but for $ 24.99 ) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds . just thought i 'd put this info . out there for everyone - hope it helps
0	recieved the gate with parts missing . when i notified amazon , they indicated repair/replacement parts were not available and i would have to return and reorder the product . as my wife needed it , this was not possible . this is not a reflection of amazon but on hte manufacturer
0	for some reason the product was not delivered , ups returned it . this was send for charity . after many emails and phone calls , the company refuses to respond or refund the money . shipping was more than the product
1	i have used many infant tubs and i love this one ! it folds so nicely i keep it in the kitchen pantry . it fits in the sink , and i keep the faucet running like a little shower , and i can rinse her with fresh water . i actually think the angle is great for an infant , but with a newborn i use one of those `` yellow bear sponges '' in the tub for extra support ( but i use one with all the infant tubs i have used ) .
0	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same . other covers i 've seen just slip on , this one has to be tied on . also , it does n't cover the entire cart . there is an opening , that my baby 's fingers always find , where he can touch the icky cart handle . not a great product . spend the extra money and buy the better one
1	this bag is great for a short trip . it has enough space for a few pampers , up to 2 bottles ... it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space . im a pro . with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me !
1	the base seems to be high quality . it is sturdy and easy to install . it is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat . other than being pricey , there is no complaints
0	after seeing the latest consumer reports article on infant car seats , i immediately replaced my britax companion with a graco snugfit . the britax had previously been highly rated , but the latest test trashed it . we were surprised , becuase it is the first seat we have owned ( on our 3rd kid ) , that really was rock solid snug once installed . i bought a graco snugfit , and i have nothing good to say about it . no matter how tight i got the straps attached to the latch in my 2006 honda odyssey , i could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort . for now , i 'm sticking with the britax
1	this stroller is the best 250.00 that i have spent in a long time ! ! we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters ( aged 16 mo 's and 3 ) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood . depending on weather and moods sometimes we 'd do 3 laps . it was such a chore pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills . plus , i can actually jog or even run ! ! ! i ca n't tell who loves it more , me , the dog , or my girls . it 's light , easy to steer , worth every penny . plus , i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls . oh , and it was incredibly easy to put together
0	do n't bother , it does n't fit at all ! ! ! ! ! ! plain and simple ... just do n't bother
1	this item is worth more than the cost ... it is a most have at home with a new born baby ... ..expecially 1st time parent like me ... ..i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep ... and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house ... ..worth more than trhe cos
0	i bought this for my 4month old for christmas , i liked the pretty , bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when i put her in , but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support would n't fix , and a pillow under her feet . she was n't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise , all of those things she would grow into though . the part i could n't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were . she tried to chew on the see-saw ( teething , everything goes to the mouth ) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her . it was a pitiful sight . poor baby . i do n't know why they did n't allow just a little more tray space and curved that silly bar out more so they would n't bump their heads . i think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy , but as it is now i think it 's just a little too `` rough around the edges '' . i took mine back to the store and then bought an evenflo , she fits in it much better and so far she loves it .
0	the third time i wore it , as i tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand ( other arm is carrying my 14-month-old ) , the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke , and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable . i do not recommend this product because of its poor construction
1	i had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before . needless to say fabric does n't protect leather very well . i ended up with deep depressions in the leather . hopefully the leather will go back ( fingers crossed ) . the firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up . and both of the carseats are as secure as ever . i have the rear and forward facing models .
0	i also had the older diaper champ and it broke so i got this new one , `` new and improved '' ! i do n't know if they 've ever tested this product . it 's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the diaper champ . it 's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it , it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips ! it 's absolutely horrible product . new or soon to be moms - do not buy this ! !
1	a snap to install , my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate , it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again . **problem** forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house -- one remote will opena ll of them ... pretty stupid design . :
1	limited space in our townhome , and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us . this is our `` highchair '' . make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table . the chair arms ( attachments ) may not clear the lip . strong , sturdy , easy to clean . knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about . great travel drawstring bag . great price ! ! ! great product . if you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that should n't be forced , this seat will work out for you . something for the manufacturers , if they read these comments ... personnal prefrence . the harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat . very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat , and its 5:00 in the morning
1	i love this sack . and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads . before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !
1	ok so i purchased this when my son was 4 months old . i always thought it was pretty neat , but figured he would n't sleep in it , because it seems to glide too slow . my son would n't sleep in anything , but his swing . i wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that i know he 'll sleep in . so based on reviews i got this product . at first i was a little disappointed , because at night as soon as i laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else , except his swing . i just figured maybe i should have bought it a couple of months ago . but , what i did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know ? he sleeps in it more than his swing now ! i guess it was n't as cushiony as he wanted it to be . i kind of noticed that too , when i got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony . another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting , so i do n't even use it . aside from that it 's great . the motor noise does n't seem to bother me or my son . it is n't very loud to me . but anyway he sleeps in it , which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night . i would say my money is well spent
0	i really do n't like this high chair at all . my little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she can not sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach . when sitting on the regular seat , she is so low that she can not get her arms above the tray to feed herself . this is a huge pain because i have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of ... out to clean . a 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair . i have had her in friends high chairs that are a graco and she fits perfectly . if i could do it over , i would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly . do n't buy this product !
0	i was very excited to try out this tent at the beach . we got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun . everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him . one of the supports had broken . it was the first time i 'd used it . i was very disappointed
0	i 'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump . now i 'm looking for another one . it 's difficult to pump if you have large nipples . you have to buy extra sheild which costs extra . it 's noisy . it loses suction.the milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.i clean the parts everyday . i have contacted medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor ( great customer service ) . it worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening . i guess it works for some and not others . now i 'm in the hunt for another pump since i want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year .
1	there is a place for everything in this drying station . i use wide mouth bottles and it 's a little tight on space , but it works great for me . it 's convenient on the counter when i have to grab a bottle for the baby .
1	great buy . my daughter loves this stroller . i like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though . your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back . i would recommend this stroller . maneuver really well , i can do it with my 1 hand , fold one hand . great , great stroller .
1	i have not gotten to use this swing yet , but i just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after i had it all put together i played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever : ) i highly recommend
0	you really do get what you pay for . i got this for around $ 53 but i did not like this product at all ! the bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made . the comforter is pretty cheap too . the only thing i saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup
1	my son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie . i simply can not imagine putting him in the infant seat without this . it keeps his entire body in place- not just his head . it provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm ( we havnt used the other side yet . ) my only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny . once he ; s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
0	$ 52.00 less weighted down by cash , and i was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local target . surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like `` clear reception '' and `` no interference '' i would be able to hear the baby 's every move from every household location and beyond . we hooked it up in short order , turned it on , and *screeeech* . apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever . we tried shutting that monitor off , and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away . no screeching , but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can . totally distorted , useless . you could n't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom . we 've packed it carefully back into the box , and are hoping target will take it back without a fight . needless to say , i 'd steer clear of this one . our $ 20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg
1	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months . we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in . we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped . we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often . at just 14 months , she could jump with both feet off the ground . it is a quality product at a reasonable price . would highly recommend
0	maybe it 's just me , but i can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature
1	bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room . the entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly . works well , looks good and feels solid . highly recommend for this use
1	this is a super-cute bath toy . my daughter enjoys putting her toys into the `` sink '' and then pulling them back out again . she also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this . love it
0	it worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time , he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his cheerios everywhere . i tried it a few more times after that and got same result . the lid is way too easy to remove .
1	i really like this -- it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature
0	terrible , terrible , terrible . the first one broke within 5 uses ; the second one lasted about 15 uses . there have got to be better ones out there
0	lucky for me i did n't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me . i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps . what a waste of time . you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked
1	i like this car seat . it is very soft for a bab
1	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby . i 'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold . very good quality product
0	i received a box as a shower gift , and they worked okay , unless i changed them a lot though , they ended up leaking . i was resigned to just living with wet spots , until someone gave me some of the lansinoh pads to try . i have no idea why babies r us does n't arry them , but they really need to . these things absolutely do not leak , they hold tons of liquid
0	i would not reccomend this product . it was cheaper at amazon.com than walmart , but it took forever to get . it took two weeks for us to get it . when caption said ships 5-7 days . than when we did get it , several pieces were broken . major pieces . when i called the company , ( which i was on hold for 30 minutes ) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken ( 5 ) that we needed to return it . i told them no , it 's over 100 lbs and i am 7mth preg . they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks . another mth . so it took almost 2 mths to get this product . it is not worth the problems . plus , nothing was labeled , and you had to figure out what pieces were what . plus , the shelves inside the unit are white , the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white . i called the company and they said this is true .
0	i just received this product after much research , and i am really disappointed with it 's quality . the mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby , and the sheets provided are like an emory board , scratchy and stiff . my baby is too long for this , so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres . i just thought it would be much better than this . looks like i will be returning it . my daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair , tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce
0	this item is packaged horribly . if you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price . received changing hutch and tower , crib and toybox intact . very happy . ordered this dresser twice , both times damaged . good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks . my suggestion is to order two dressers , take the best pieces from each , and return the rest . believe me , you will be glad you did
0	i only have the turtle and the fishing net . turtle : the turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it . i dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months . i finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water . there was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle . i tried washing it with bleach water , but more kept coming out even after repeated washings . i finally just gave up and threw it out . i had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem . fish net : the paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use . the fish themselves are fine .
0	pinched my daughter 's tush ( even though it was opened all the way , it bent as she was getting on ) . she never went near it again . have to be very careful as child is sitting down .
0	the suctions are pretty weak , dont stick well to the tray . also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up . the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face . when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick , as soon as my son would touch it , it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face . they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time . i took this back the next day . i bought the sassy fascination station instead . it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose , even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray .
1	we have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights , as well as on many car trips at home and abroad . it is great ! it is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars . on some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom , but the cushioning is adequate , my son has never complained . he seems very comfortable in it . `` baby bargains '' recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby , and i am online ordering one for my daughter right now . if you expect to travel , this seat is an essential . it is light enough that lugging it around airports , cruiseships and such is not a total pain ( although as with any seat , it is nice to have a bag , we 've done it both with and without )
1	its definitely a practical way to carry the essentials for a baby or a kid or whatever .
0	what more can i say ? these bottles leak all over the place . i switched to dr. brown 's , and they have been great . no leaks , and my son spits up less . do not buy avent bottles and nipples - they leak like crazy , and cause a huge mess
0	i ca n't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review . we have 10m twins , and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months . it 's terrible . problems : 1 . no sun protection . the visors are locked in place . unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back , it will be beating in your babies ' eyes , and you 'll need to buy a non-peg perego sunshade accessory . 2 . hard to steer . it gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt . if the sidewalk buckles just an inch ( common from tree roots ) , the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks . it 's hard to steer in a straight line , so it 's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks . 3 . it 's flimsy . the bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use . it now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it . the cupholder broke during the first week . 4 . hard to unfold . it takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position . do n't even think about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands : you need both hands free to deal with this thing . 5 . bad customer support . the stroller comes with no weight/height/age suggestions . when we first tried to put our twins in it , they were swimming in it , and could n't be upright . when we called peg perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely , the support rep said `` do n't know . '' yes it 's lightweight and folds up nicely . but the light weight is actually a drawback ; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that 's difficult to steer . my advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers . even if you are n't an active parent -- i 'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand , dirt , and grass that you will encounter . if stroller size is the most important factor to you , look at `` stadium seating '' strollers .
1	i bought this chair for my third child and wish i would 've had it for the first two as well . it is easy to assemble , easy to use and easy to clean . i like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age . i love the wheels because i could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner . the one hand release on the tray is a dream for moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems to enjoy the toys , too . i only wish it came with extra trays
1	we got this seat in a different color for our first baby . we feel very secure with it . easy to install and a little hint , they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars ... you do n't need it , you can fasten the seat without the base . the directions for it are on the seat . i like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it , and that it 's transportable to our stroller . ( bough seperatly ) it comes with a head `` brace '' whatever those things are called to cradle the head . those never do anything , and are pretty useless , but the seat itself is great .
0	this mirror really is n't worth the money . you 'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby , that 's about all this thing does . the remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror , kinda hard to do driving down the road . also , the music is n't very loud , atleast not loud enough to get baby 's attention when upset , which is what i was hoping for . and the lights are n't very bright . really ca n't see that they even light up unless it 's very dark out . also , the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards , but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat , it does n't stay in place that well . you could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror
1	so far i have n't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies ( also we have n't run into issues to need it ) but i have used the nose aspirator and it 's great . it 's soft and i do n't fear hurting his nose ! i 'm very excited to use the rest of the products
1	i replaced my baby 's old bumper with this one when she became mobile . it works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats . the only complaint i have is that the `` short '' section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby , thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib
1	i think this is a great quality product , and i love the idea of it . however , i find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it . it 's not very soft and it 's just so big for him right now . i can get him to sleep in it only if he 's completely zonked out beforehand . i think the mini co-sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning . the original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it . i do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many , many times
0	i 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son . i just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable . he usually cries when he is in it . he fell asleep in it once , but he looked so contorted . it 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way . and the pocket is so deep it closes over his head . and i know i got the correct size . i 've given up and am looking for a better sling . right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day , and he loves it , but it 's a little cumbersome , and i want him to be able to recline .
1	this product definitely saves space but i 've had a hard time cleaning the tray . yes , it 's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that i end up hand-washing it . there are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that i 'm always finding places that i misseed washing . trust me , the baby will manage to get food there too ! this product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing ( i 've seen this on some highchair models ) .
1	my baby is now 5 months old , and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night . this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
1	i love my fisher-price infant toddler swing . i have two of them for my twin boys . they love it and i know it is safe . also is it easy to get them in and out of . lynne ambros
1	i purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care . it has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other . the picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - i can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house ! i would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children . it will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along
1	i actually got the snug tub deluxe . this version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post . it also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it . i used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play . my only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping . i put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up . this was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping . i 'm glad i bought this instead of the eurobath
1	i love this gate one because of the height . it is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble . i also like that i can operate the gate with only one hand . that is great because like other mom 's my hands are often busy with something else . i would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate
1	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping . the crib arrived within a week . assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable . it 's attractive , but my only complaints are 1 ) it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint ( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint ) and 2 ) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps . overall , i 'm very happy with the crib and the price- ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may
0	i received this steralizer as a gift . if i had to do all over again i would have never put it on my registry . the steralizer is messy ; everytime i lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere . in addition i have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out ... there has to be a better way
0	i was happy when this product arrived . it arrived in great time . i like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets . it states that it should be used in the last trimester , i am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat . i have even went to my appointmets with it thinking i am using it wrong . it will pick up my heart beat , but not the babys . i ca n't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as i mentioned it says to use it in your last trimester . the greatest thing about this is the cd 's i play them for the baby every now and then
0	i was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes . the ad said `` universal fit '' . well , it fit , but second size up car seats are taller and kind of lean back . when you attach the canopy , it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun . a hat better serves my child then this aparatus . it now sits in the garage with all the other failed baby devices
0	my daughter placed this crib on her registry , mainly because of the price . she did n't want anyone spending $ 500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for . i found this set up at a `` depot '' store and it was beautiful and sturdy , but did n't come in natural . so i went home and ordered it online . it arrived 4 days before the shower ( 8 days early from eta ) but it was shattered . the first 3 pieces we looked at were split , chipped crushed . quite a surprize considering the box was n't in bad shape . we decided to return it and buy a more expensive model ( at a local specialty store ) . amazon 's return policy was amazing , a click on the mouse and the next day ups picks up . no packing labels to print , no lugging big heavy items to post office , very simple . amazon gets 5 stars , storkcraft - 0
1	this has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born , and the results will effect them for their whole life ! it felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day , and near the end of my pregnancy i was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly , but i am so glad i pushed through . my daughter is amazing ! i am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement . baby plus did everything it promised and more ! here are some examples : at birth : eyes wide open , hands open , instant excellent nurser , slept 4-6 hours at night , very calm and happy , cried only when hungry . at 1 month : smiling all the time at everyone , sleeping 8-10 hrs . at night. , recognized mom and dad 's faces . at 2 months : laughing , holding head up at 3 months : pressing buttons on toys for 6mos + , rolling both directions , holding own bottle at 4 months : sitting with support at 5 months : sitting without support , drinking from sippy cup , singing , saying first words at 6 months : puts self to sleep , pulled self to standing position , creeping ... and now almost crawling . i am completely amazed at her advancements . people mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is , and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known . i am totally sold on baby plus
1	i had my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes with just some toggle-like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through . but my baby comes out of this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time . and we 've had a few days this winter here in the northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face .
0	i got this sterilizer because of the avent name . my main complaint is that the lid does n't lock into the base when closing . you have to use alot of power for it to close . i have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock .
1	in terms of pre-natal resources , this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven . i can not think of a reason not to buy this product . every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child . this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born . you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting
1	this stroller holds up to 55 lbs. , unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs . i love the raised handle bars . they cause less strain on your shoulders and back . there is a roomy basket under the seat , which is a great bonus . the 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass . once my son was able to sit up on his own , i have used an umbrella stroller exclusively . this is hands down the best one i have ever had . it is also very modern looking in black and gray
0	we just learned in parenting class ( and i checked with my pediatrician ) that you do n't need to sterlize bottles , nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher . so save some money and do n't get this !
0	there is no need for this item . it is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed . i hated having a wall between my baby and me . when i woke up to nurse , i had to take her out of it anyway . co-sleeping is intuitive , naturally safe and easy easy easy ... please do n't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement .
0	this cute turtle was terrific for about a week . my toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options . unfortunately , the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use . i was the one pressing the button when it came off , and i was n't being rough or using excessive force . we had to shake the turtle to get the button out but could n't re-fasten it easily . for a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle , but then the rubber sensor fell off as well . with no way to turn the thing on , we threw it away . my toddler was sooooo sad , but it was worthless to us . since this is overall a popular product , i suppose we just had bad luck . i would n't buy another one , though
1	this stool is great , right size for young child to seat on the potty . it is narrow and does n't take up a lot of room , plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty
1	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless . i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly , and i do not miss that . i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry . it has always worked well , and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately . the picture is clear , the sound is excellent . you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in , but the cords are all generous in length . we would go nuts without it
1	this is an awfully cute bedding set and i 'm very pleased with it . it arrived quickly , and is good quality , though the fitted sheet is a little thin , it will still be a good backup .
1	my son is [ ... ] and aside from getting too big for his crib , my sister is having a baby and needs it . i was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his `` crib attachment , '' but this bed made it easy as pie . it 's adorable , sturdy and fun . my little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we 've never had a problem ( we 've had it for a month ) . he loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying `` choo choo . '' it 's just been great ... .i 'm so glad we spent the money
0	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected . the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but i do n't quite get how to adjust this . it also says that there is a blanket . maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here . i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does . at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1/2 inches thick . i 'm pretty disappointed . i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems
1	this is the best product we have ever used for our little girl ( yes that includes swings and bouncy seats ) . i stumbled across it when they had just come out . she was sitting in it at 4 months . by the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it . however ... i see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding . i recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child . it allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster ( which is a double edged sward ! tough fro parents good for kids ) .
1	my husband and i just had a wonderful baby girl ( apr . 9 , 2007 ) and i simply could not live without this item . my daughter loves sleeping in it . it is light ; therefore , it can be easily moved from one room to another , as needed . you could easily travel with it ... . from hotels to the `` grandparents house . '' it can be folded compactly and easily stored ; and , there is also a handle for carrying . the light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well . ***obviously , do not leave your child unsupervised in it ! ** it is excellent and i highly recommend it to all parents
0	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out , sort of , but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips . then when it comes time to change the film , the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors . my sister-in-law told me to register for it . why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund
0	same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son 's toy . the turtle cup came off after the first use ( and within 20 min ! ) . my son is 8 months old and it ca n't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old . and a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off . luckily we noticed it before my son was injured , unfortunately i had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son , who no longer had his toy to play with . i would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts . i would recommend that you do not buy this item . i now have to waste more time returning it to the store
0	this is a great product for a few weeks , then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out ! i go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out . no matter how tight i make the blanket , the velcro comes apart . i encourage you to buy their other swaddleme blanket with the larger velcro flap .
1	when registering for baby needs i laughed at the idea of wipes warmer - i thought what a waste ! after my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes i rethought this . this product has been a life changer ! baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great . easy to use , the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out . remember to purchase the pop-up wipes however . great product . i would give as a gift .
0	i would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks . the walker seemed great for the price , it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it . unfortunately , the design is terrible on the sounds n'lights feature . it began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it . after much frustration trying to get `` to '' the battery compartment to replace it , we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all . the internal battery is soldered in place . once it loses it 's original charge , you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby
0	i was very excited to finally recieve this stroller , but after i put it together ( which was pretty simple ) , it was very heavy and bulky to handle . i was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon . i bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution . i was not able to load it in the back of mt suv due to the size and weight , and it is very long and hard to steer . anyone considering the ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney . it does not accomodate my evenflo carrier either , so i would have needed to also purchase the graco carseat . i am returning the stroller to amazon today
0	i bought the avent breastshells because of my sore nipples , and a way to collect leaking milk while i was not nursing , and relieve some engorment . 1 . it is very messy when removing the colleting cap 2 . my nipples are still sore 3 . and the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump if i would have known about these factors i would not have purchased this product
0	this monitor did n't work for us at all ! we heard a lot of static , and the alarm would go off too . it would n't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen . the alarm was always going off .
0	i have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and i were asleep . a couple of good , hard yanks by your child and this device fails . this might me a good product for infants and toddlers , but if your child is over 2 years old , try something else like the lock release fridge latch by safety 1st ( but be aware that even though these are by far superior , you 'll still have to place about 3 of these safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them . that 's what worked for us anyway . i 'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination .
0	i thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that i have clean nipples for my baby . unfortunately , when you read the instructions for most latex nipples , they are n't dishwasher safe , and you are instructed to hand wash . so , having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless . i use mine as a container that i can airdry my handwashed nipples in . do n't waste your money
1	the item is so much cheaper than the alternative , which is $ 200 . it was easy to use and easy to store when not in use
1	i love this containers . first of all , i am a big fan of the isis breast pump , so these containers are perfect for me . i express into these containers -- freeze them -- thaw them out -- replace the sealing disc with the nipple -- warm it up . then my husband is ready to feed the baby . it 's one of their times together , and i get to spend time with my older children . perfect
0	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet . the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both
1	i purchased this to put on the changing table . i was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers , wipes , lotions , etc . i purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then i found this one . it fits perfectly and holds the wipes container , several diapers , lotion , hair brush , etc . i love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over . this allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby . the price was also reasonable . i was looking at buying one from pottery barn for twice the amount . this basket is a great buy
1	my husband and i received this changing table , along with the 4-drawer chest and the monterey crib , as a gift from our parents . we were skeptical , because we wanted a nursery that was affordable , yet not too flimsy . we were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together . the pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery , and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood . and the nicest part is that you do n't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery . my friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are . * the only reason i rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled . it was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks , took 5 minutes . bottom line : if you are looking for a beautiful , quality nursery that is affordable , this is a great choice
1	excellent value for money . our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we would n't have managed the holidays without it ! this seat is strong and stable , yet easily assembled/dis-assembled . it folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family . we purchased this on 19 dec and it was delivered prior to christmas - well done amazon
1	this potty seat is the only toilet training item i have bought . i highly recomend it ! my daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty . you need a step stool for them to get up on their own . i like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb . 3 ft. 2 yro . climbing up situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal this product i feel helps get to that goal .
1	when our first child was born , my wife purchased the lower model from medela . with the second child and her having to go back to work sooner , we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied . she uses it everyday when she is at work . the price might be higher than others , but think about all of the money you will save on formul
1	i was a little apprehensive about ordering this product , as i read all of the negative comments . i ordered it anyway , because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son . when it arrived ( earlier than expected ) , i noticed that it was easy to assemble , and that because it is not made with very thick plastic , it probably would n't be a good idea to order this for big children who are potty training . my son is 18 months old , and 22 lbs , and it is perfect for him , sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty . he really enjoys climbing up himself , and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process . i let him look at the box , and we talked about how the little girl was going potty , and he liked seeing the little girl on the box : ) using the potty , `` just like him '' . so if your child is very big , or potty training at 3+ years , i would n't order this , they do n't need it . i would just get a stool
1	we have gone through a few packages of the table toppers and we love them ! our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down ... .she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive ... .and she does n't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating . we finally found the shopper toppers at toys r us and i was so excited i bought two packages ... .and they do n't work worth anything ! the adhesive on those is down the sides , not across the top where it should be , to stick on the shopping cart handle ... .in fact we 've decided that the table toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart . also , with only a shopper topper in our bag while out for lunch recently , we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table ! well done
0	i bought this thermometer when my second son was born , thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money . my husband and i tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was . we both got 5 different readings . i did n't see what the need of the plastic covers were for , since we ran out of them quickly . ( not to mention , you ca n't find replacements anywhere . ) my biggest complant was that after a month , the product completely stopped working , even after changing the batteries . i would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer
1	we 've had this toy for around 3 years now . my second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn ! it is also a hit with other children visiting our house . the toy is as educational as it is fun ! we 've used it to practice colors , shapes , and musical creativity . it can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~ $ 20 new . all in all a fantastic toy well worth the price ! another upside is how friendly and helpful the neurosmith company is . we lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement . my friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much
1	i 've had this seat for some time and i saw all of the negative reviews . it took a bit to figure out the quirks , but once i did , it was fine . the seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet , not the back or in the middle like mine at home . you have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat . otherwise it will fold , which is probably what happened to the other reviewer . it will slid off as you come off if you 're not careful . my five year old uses it by herself and i use it with my 2 year old . it is so compact that i can stick it in my purse ( i carry in in a zippy bag ) and very easy to clean . there are n't too many of this type of product out there , but for me , it works just fine
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked , and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile , possibly injuring or killing your child . do not buy !
1	while not as portable as i assumed it would be ... it 's been a great space saver over a std . highchair and great to have
0	my baby slid both down and off the side of this . i thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated , but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base , rather it acted as a swivel and i found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner . i am involved in a sids research study and this product alarms me ! she could have suffocated ! i am trying to contact the company to report this item ... please do not buy
1	we have tried 3-4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children ( now 4 yrs and a 10 month old ) . this is a great option for a gate . ours is solidly installed , it clicks shut automatically with an audible click ( so after my 4 year old goes through , i do n't have to worry about him leaving it open - it closes by itself and i can hear the `` click '' that tells me it closed ) , and you do n't have to drill holes in your woodwork/staircase to install this . it is much easier to open , just as sturdy as the drill-in gates , and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried . we love it for our house
0	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small ... do n't waste your money , it 's not worth it !
0	the size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there . i put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves , so much for the other 4 speeds . my daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what i hate most about this swing . my daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing , looking like she is going to fall out . i just pray that buckle is secure ! she also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars . so , i do n't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing . if you do n't like to get house work done or take showers , this swing might be for you
0	my husband and i recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy . the noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby . we were greatly disappointed
1	this was a great addition to the joovy caboose stand on tandem -- i can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse , have everything discreetly on hand , and not have to lug around yet another bag . organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and does n't shift around at all . have found this product to be really helpful
0	i unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child . i got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before i decided to return it . you literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir , which slides on , has no rubber seal or other watertight implements , can leak everywhere . judging by the other comments , i 'm glad it leaked before i had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes .
1	this works great with our chicco capri stroller . it took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close . however , once i figured that out , it was great . i could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed . the swivel is a great concept . i actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder ( one on each side ) and mommy could have her water bottle clip . we just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles .
1	we really like our graco digital imonitor . it gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes , and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously . we do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box -- usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block , depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries . the lights that light up for baby 's sound are quite bright , which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness . i turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake
0	we have the 49mhz whisper connect and love it ( see our review of that one ) . we needed a second monitor to replace a 900mhz fisher price monitor that is 4+ years old , and decided to try this one out . we set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice , and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up . we thought we must have a defective unit , so we returned it and got another , and we had the same problem . there is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound . we 're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it
1	table toppers are an awesome product . we do n't leave the house without them . it gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp ... . there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the table topper . we just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing . the different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food . other people , not only parents , ask about the table toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product
1	i picked this monitor after reading many reviews . the reviews did n't lie . this monitor does great on distance . i have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors . the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor . i can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound . i could hear him grunt even ! i do n't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss . you 're given many channels in order to find the right strength . i could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal ( he was on opposite end of house upstairs ) . i also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times , not getting it soaked . also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound ( no radio or tv or mobile playing ) . great product , strongly recommend . my son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great . this monitor is the right choice for the average household . interference may come if you 're on the same channel . i have wifi network , cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just do n't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
1	finally ! a big , spacious , nice looking toy box ! ! i looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor , but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there ! the lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up . the drawers on the bottom are small , but hold a few things , and do n't take anything away from the big interior of the box . it makes the box look more sofisticated ! ! love the new colors and design . thanks little tikes !
1	my son loves this toy , although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color . he is 10.5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy . a good buy and will keep them busy
1	you do n't need the whole kit . only the loop and latch is needed . if you use the plastic , it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway . you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing . this way , you can use the softfit breastshield too
0	i just took a course from the florida highway safety program . i thought something like this would be wonderful , especially for little ones in the rear facing position . i was dead wrong . anything put in front of , on the side of , in fact , anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash . this toy , even latched down , poses a threat to the baby . he or she may just have to be bored for a while . on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment
1	if you have an ipod or mp3 player , i 'd recommend getting this . i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week , and tested it out ( our baby has n't been born yet ) . the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo , and i 'm 1/2 deaf . i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color . my only criticism is that it takes batteries ( no ac adapter ) . we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly . for $ 20 , i think it 's great
0	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive . well , i learned my lessen- you get what you pay for . like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw , if you will , closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in . i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it , it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie . i hope this will work out much better
1	works great . we tried other brands of gripe water , which did n't seem to do much . something about baby 's bliss does the trick
1	i love the bather . i hated the old plastic ones , with this my daughter is more comfortable and does n't cry when i give her a bath . i wish i had it with my first child
1	i was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this icrib sound system . it has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer , so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the icrib will shut down after the specified time . the nightlight is also really neat , as it cycles between four different colors . the only problem with this product is that it can not run on ac , only on batteries , so we 'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years , but otherwise this is a great product . edit -- after further consideration i would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons . first , i have found the lack of an ac power source to be very inconvenient . second , as the batteries wear down , the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly
0	years ago when the diaper genie first hit the market . i was given one as a gift for my baby shower . it did not work the way i thought it would . the genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present . this was not the case . the smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash . also the smell that the genie left after opening the genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible . i had to clean it several times just to get the smell out . needless to say when i had my second child and once again received one . it remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years . i would definitely not recommend this item for new moms . too much hassle
0	i bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me . i bought this to try to reduce the risk of sids since his has been sleeping in my bed . unfortunately , he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper . once his legs went off the side , his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper . of course this concerned me so each time i woke up , i had to move him again . finally , after a couple of time of doing this , i just took him out of it . this is the second sleep positioner i have bought and both have been worthless ! ! !
1	i had one of these with my second son and loved it . we just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary . when it was hot out we could uncover him , and when we went into somewhere with air-conditioning we would just cover him up . it is soft and cozy . we found it so convenient . we will be purchasing another one for number three , who 's due in may .
0	we purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel . i think it 's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the volo , not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down . on the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact . not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange . the stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car . we first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad . this was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller . the seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller . i think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and can not shift much in the seat as it offers no support . on top of it , the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same . the awning offers very little sun protection . the mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access . on top of that , you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller . when it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired . with limited cargo room , it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles . it has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering . further , while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car , riding escalators and getting on and off the bus , the volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces . we encountered potholes , dirt paths , cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the volo was a disaster . the wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters . locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief . cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo . if i had to do it over , i would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels , easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat
1	my newborn loves this seat . the calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy ! easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you . great product !
0	please spend your money on a different gate . there are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first , but after going through what we have gone through , i wish i would have gotten a different gate . we have twin girls in a bi-level house . a stair gate is a must . the 90 day warranty is a joke , because naturally , each gate broke after 90 days . same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn . i will say - when it worked , it was nice . but read other reviews , and you will see the same problem over and over again . shame on me for buying it again . it just broke this past saturday , after six months of use . i will contact the manufacturer , but as in the past , i 'm sure i wo n't get anywhere . if enough people complain , perhaps they will change the design . again , please look elsewhere
0	i was very disappointed in this liner . it seemed like such a great idea , but i could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath . once the water level rose , so did the liner . we ended up returning this product to amazon
1	my mom always said that the rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me i found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and i like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so i dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what ? my brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old .
1	after reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller . i am glad we did n't listen to those naysayers . it was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful . the comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish . yes , the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is . we 've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains ( stanford dish if you are from palo alto ) and it rides smoothly . it gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters ( 2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant ) . i feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor . also , we love the capabilities , spring shocks for a smooth ride , shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers . we have a toyota sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk . as for the weight . yes , it is heavier but come on , it is not `` 10 '' times heavier . people exaggerate too much . if you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms , then the stroller is nothing . people are too much of a wimp . it is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much . they made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy . gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life ( my two daughters ) are protected . the only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying . just use silicone spray and they all went away . we 've been through rain , dirt , and hot sun with this stroller and we 've been so happy with it . i highly recommend purchasing it . but make sure you have a truck , mini-van , or suv . i am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller . but i figured if you have two toddler/enfants , you may consider getting a bigger car
1	i just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs . my first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs . however , gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative . we considered this model and the evenflo `` top of stair gate '' . after inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking . if one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit . also , why take the chance with safety ? anyway , here are a few things to consider when installing this item : 1 . i took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only . this is a must do . it would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall . 2 . unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and do n't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through , use longer screws than the dinky 1/4 '' to 1/2 '' screws that are provided in the kit . i went with 2 '' screws for additional strength . 3 ) installation is n't that big of a deal . just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls . i found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet . it was n't a five minute job but it was not hard at all . i 'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog .
1	finally ! ! ! i am a stickler for matching things , with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but i love having the matching hat for my december baby , i know she 's warm .
1	this is my favorite sheet for our daughter 's crib . it is a soft knit material and it washes up so well . it fits easily onto the matress and i have never had a problem with it coming loose . it is also such an adorable print
1	just received this set and my wife and i love it ! the construction is very solid but not too bulky for us . the micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture . the only two complains are : 1 ) the handle 's height is not adjustable , which seems a bit too high to us ( i am 5'6 '' btw ) ; and 2 ) it would be great to have a hand-break ( i.e . wheel lock button on the handle ) -- we previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not ; it is the collapse/expand button instead . despite these imperfection , we feel it much worth the $ 195 we paid for
0	i like this humidifier alot but now i can not find replacement filters for it . i only had it for about 3 months and now i can not find replacement filters . this unit was not cheap either , it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating . i would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only
0	i like the music , but we have to have it on auto to play . because i have a mirror in the seat to see my son ( he is still backward facing ) , i ca n't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on . also , i have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim . so just music plays . there are plenty of other smaller items that can do that . this thing also eats up batteries like you would n't believe . i am changing them every couple of days , and we are n't in the car much . what a disappointment ! ! good concept , but does n't work well at all
0	i just bought this seat for my 9 month old son . i bought it for the convenience of the fold down front . as good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees . he is a thin baby so i do n't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby . also , the seat it self is slippery . i have to place a rag down before i put the baby in because he will slide forward if i do n't . this is very uncomfortable for him.unfortunately , this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier . that is really the only good thing i can say about this product .
0	this product is great but do not buy it from bp medical . you can not return an unopened and unused product for a full refund - they charge a 15 % restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase
1	i am a mother of 6 and this works . you can put a few baby neccessities in it . i use it for a few diapers , baby wipes , desitin , and the bulb syringe . i can move it around and it does not take much space
1	this timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your brain when you have a newborn , as the hours , feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life . while it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank , whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie , and tracking of daily totals for everything - that 'd be more of a infantcare pda , and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device . all it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby 's life , consequently making your life way easier . i wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting , for example . i click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour , and had a diaper and bottle right before that . then i just go back to sleep . on the other hand , he beguns grunting and making noises and i see the itzbeen says it 's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper , and i know it 's time to get up and feed him . it 's also great for team caregiving , as my husband can hand me the itzbeen after doing his morning shift , and i automatically know when the last change and bottle were . we use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too . thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - i hope to see an `` itzbeen ii '' w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use , especially in the fog of a 1am , 3am , and 5am feeding schedule ! ( my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :
1	i have bought this set for a gift , but also received it as a gift myself ( from my registry ) . although my daughter is two and a half now , i would recommend the playtex nursers to everyone ! they are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles . i definitely like the drop-ins liners better than the traditional ones ... from a convenience standpoint , paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system . i 'm not planning on any more children , but i do n't dare part with these bottles yet . they are stored in my basement for future use , either my myself or family members . they also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze
0	i went through an entire box in two days ! the fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly . plus , the diameter of these are much smaller than any others . try gerber or lansinoh
1	i got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend . it worked great even after many years ... i eventually purchased the pump in style advanced limited edition where the pump can be separated from the bag . it takes up less desk space ( no extra space required for the bag ) . also , it 's more portable if all you need is the pump . i pump all over the house ( study , bedroom , living room while watching tv with my husband ) . just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the medelas ... it may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges . every woman 's breast and nipples are different sizes . initially , i was using the standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things that go over your breasts ) . it was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though i was engorged with plenty of milk . it would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk ! i went to see a lactation consultant who suggested i try the next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one to try and it made a world of difference . i could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins . now , i pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins ( estimate since i do n't really time it cause it 's so fast ) . i am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank . this pump made a world of difference . i think medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes . the standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps , the 27mm and a 30mm .
0	i bought this play gym because i figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good ... plus the reviews i read were good . our local babiesr'us did n't have displays of the playgyms so i had no idea that this gym would suck . i hate it ! ! my son only loves it cause i put other toys on there . notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms are n't the ones that originally came with the gym . why buy extra toys ? ? i paid $ 69 for this gym ... it should come with more toys . i tried to return this for the gym by tiny love that comes with lights , music and lots of toys but when i opened the product the original packaging got messed up and i was unable to return or exchange . what a waste of money for me . i received another playgym that my friend bought for $ 20 from my baby shower . that only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too . my point is that you do n't have to spend so much money on a playgym . your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at or if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys .
0	product is not worth the money . made the bassinet very unstable
0	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy , you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) technology . 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor , though . here 's why : it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house , that it can not share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 ghz devices . this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones . the correct arrangement should be : baby monitor : 900 mhz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss ) wifi netowrk : 2.4 ghz cordless telephone : 5.8 ghz digital-spread-spectrum ( dss
0	we bought this when our baby was born ( 6 months ago , only used it a few times until recently ) . he loves it now to get him to sleep . the problem lies in that at 4 am , my husband and i awake to hear the mobile playing ... scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it . we go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals ... .the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off , causing the mobile to fall on the baby . ( he thought it was the funniest thing in the world , he was okay , thank god . ) but the little plastic hook piece was in his hand . if you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find . i thank god that he didnt put that in his mouth . it is a great soother for the baby , but be sure there are no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it has been great .
0	we had the fisher proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital . this was the one we picked in our price range . we had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it ... until there was some weather changes . every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound ! buy the sound a lights for $ 15 and save the extra money ! !
1	i am impressed with this seat ! this seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet . the training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes : pottyprincess , pottypirate , pottypony and pottysaurus . i called the free line ( 87-pottypal ) and was able to buy the stool ( a little cheaper than amazon 's set ) and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards . i am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product .
0	my son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months , the monitor worked pretty well . we got a bit of static from time to time , but i would have given it 4 stars . but ... one night i woke up to reassure myself with the little green `` on '' light and saw that the monitor was not on . thinking it was a fluke , i turned it back on , checked the baby and went to bed . but , over the course of a couple of weeks , it became more and more unreliable , turning off at will . it was also hard to turn it back on . i had to flip the switch several times before it would work . and , this is not a battery issue , since it was plugged in the entire time . i went to the evenflo website and read the faqs . there 's a mention of a problem with the power light going out , but nothing about the monitor itself going out . needless to say , we 've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand . i mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably . she 's bought a different monitor too . both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static . i would n't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes .
1	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product . my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help . ( after she was diagnosed , we were given zantac ... but still used this as well ! ) it 's a true godsend . we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon . it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price . we called it 'liquid gold ' in our house
0	it 's not just the most icredible piece of junk i ever seen , it is the most dangerous piece of junk i ever seen on the market for kids . the plastic is very thin , very weak and bends every each way . my daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight . is slides off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child 's weight , which really frightened my girl . there 's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat . i feel soooo stupid to have bought it ( (
0	i bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter 's homemade baby foods . you put the blade at the bottom of the cup , load the food in , then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece ( which contains the motor ) on top . the concept seemed good and it is a compact size . cons : 1 ) the cup holds less than 1 cup of food ... if you go over that amount , any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess , and sometimes causes the motor to stop running ... guess it shorts it out and i have to wait until it dries out before i can start again . if you 're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food , you 'll have to puree several batches . 2 ) you can only run the motor for short periods of time ... up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods . this is fine for soft foods , but if trying to puree meats , for example , it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind , wait , grind , wait ... .3 ) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow , cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy , since you really need a faster blade to puree them . i 've found that the for pureering baby foods , the best thing to use is a blender , since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed . do n't waste your money on buying this
1	we like this stroller . it seems to be pretty durable , and its weight and portability ( shoulder strap ) make it ideal for trips , especially in airports . my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall ( 6'4 '' ) , but it is fine for me ( 5'3 '' ) . we like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline , but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on . he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet , so the various levels of the reclining back are nice . overall , a good stroller for the price
1	after reading some of the reviews i felt compelled to share my experience with this product . i love it ! i 'm not sure if they made a different model before , but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine ( its on the back ) . its not rocket science if you follow the directions . i never have problems with the bottle floating . if you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to , then the bottle wo n't float . the warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting . it also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature . there are no `` dings '' or timers , but that has n't presented any problems for me . overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well . as a first time mom , i highly recommend it .
0	the biggest disappointment was that after 6 months , the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams ( thus patch would not work ) . kel-gar does not warranty the product , and the store that the tub came from ( via amazon ) only offered a 90 day warranty . also , the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub , the rest flows behind it . thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill
1	used this for double stroller while on vacation in hershey park -fantastic ! easy to put on - easy to store ! i do n't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway ! but this did it 's duty
1	lightweight , high-quality construction . we are very pleased with it , and our 1.5yr girl just loves it . the carrying strap is a very convenient addition . do n't waste your money on a $ 20 umbrella stroller , spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller
1	heats milk and food esecially when frozen . i use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food i 've made
0	i bought the dual room imonitor yesterday . ( only available in store at babies r us ) . it is the same as the one shown here , but it has two transmitters to montor two children . based on only 4 hours of testing , i am taking the unit back . pro : -the range was great . whole house , plus 800ft outside . -no interference . i live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference . -easy to setup . -shape/size of parent units are much better than others ( especially sony ) cons : -controls are not very straightforward . -the unit always hisses . it is not sound/voice activated . -the power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed . when you turn it off , it does not beep or let you know that you did . the button is easy to bump , and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off , and you think it is on . -the deal breaker : a power outage requires turns off child units . with even a short power interruption , the child units come up in the `` off '' mode . you have to go to the baby 's room and turn them on . until you do , the parent unit will beep and flash red . we have been using the sony 910 for 3 years with our first child . i guess it has spoiled us
1	after using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub , this one is the best ! i only wish i would 've just bought this one to begin with . my little guy is 6 months old , 24 pounds but ca n't sit up yet . he still uses the side that lays him down in the water , and he loves it ! do n't waste your money on other tubs , this one is the best . this one will grow with your child while saving water too
0	i bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier , then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle . wrong ! ! ! she hated these bottles . i would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder . i gave these bottles one star because i think it is a good concept but unfortunately did n't work for us . the only bottle she would take was the playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth
0	i agree with several others about it being very difficult to clean . there are so many nooks and crannies . i used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when i had my son and it was no different . my son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that i do not want to let him practice because i dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal . i went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great ! now i have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair .
0	the whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub , but that is impossible since it wo n't stick to tile above the tub . i had n't even put any toys in it , and it would n't stick . i returned it and found something on `` one step ahead '' .
0	this monitor is awful . i have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1 . it makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times , like 2 am ! ! ! do not buy this monitor . the onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking ! ! !
0	this gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke ! the company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty . they will not even let you buy a replacement part . they want you to buy a entire new gate . what a rip off ! do n't buy this gate , it is a piece of trash
0	i think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby . everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams . he is an easy going fellow but he has n't liked being held to closely . he wants his freedom and this does n't give much freedom to a newborn . also , the `` training '' video is more of a promotional advertisement . i had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it
0	i purchased these monitors thinking i would n't need to use them at all since the baby 's room is right next door . i 'm glad i did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there , so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort . anyways , there are only 2 channels on these monitors , which is a bummer since i live in a big apartment complex . i get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people 's babies crying , which really weirded me out the first time i heard it . i tried using a battery with it when i brought it with me to check the mail ( yes the door was locked , no i am not a bad mother ) and was only able to hear static . i wish i had bought a monitor with more channels . note to self : keep reciepts and packaging from now on ! !
1	we got this before our little one was born . she was born a little premature and only 4 lbs . we used it in her bedside bassinet , and later in her crib . although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib , they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours . baby girl is now two and we continue to use it . she 's in a toddler bed now , and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she 's not supposed to ! this is a great device and everyone should have one . comparible in price to other nursery monitors , you get so much more . it also has clear sound and little interference in our house
0	this did not work for us at all . i found that i could n't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off . if you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton
0	i got this swing and i will be talking it back . i put it on 5 and it will not move . i do n't know what it would be like with the baby in it . i just tryed it .
1	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system . i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 . i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system . i feel like i am 'doing a good thing ' for my little boy on the way . while using babyplus , the battery cover clips snapped off . i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover , no questions asked . babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby , rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts
0	i bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs . unless you have a changing station ( or crib , wherever you want to hang it ) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will not hold it well . and the `` shelves '' are a bit insecure . it 's a great idea , but just did n't pan out .
1	i have this seat for my 4 month old and i love it ... yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but i have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a toyota avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest ... with my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car ... graco has made it so that i no longer have to do this . my son is nearly 20lbs already and had i been using your average infant seat i would have to buy him a new one already ... bravo to graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits ... another perk is it has the canopy so the sun is n't in his eyes which i also would n't get if he were in a convertible car seat . my one and only complaint is that the fabric is n't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but i just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine ... this in itself is n't enough to make me trade this seat for another
1	we live in the cold , rainy northwest part of the country . this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december . it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital . we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat . he stays warm and protected in the bundle me . this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby . it is a must for winter babies . it is well worth the money
1	i bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and i am so glad i had it ! i used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller . there are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it . my daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep . she loved being able to see everything around her at our level . i am 5'3 '' and my husband is 6'1 '' and we both wore it comfortably . i would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller
0	we received this item as a xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken . my two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor . the legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item . we were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a step 2 product .
0	we have the graco ultra clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years . with a new baby on the way , we thought we 'd upgrade to the new technology . oops . it turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the ultra clear ( could n't even make it to the other side of the house ) , and the reception was quite poor . and the annoying beeping was the clincher . i sent it back today and bought another $ 40 ultra clear . oh , and i tried the fisher price private connection also , and had the same issues..
1	seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical ! my niece absolutely loved them . she had such an easy time handling them because they are her size , which is unusual . all other instrument toys are so much larger and it 's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them ! the smiles and giggles are worth everything
0	i loved the gate . so when i moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate , i needed the extension . it was well worth it . my daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it , and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway . i am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because i would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall . this gate was a great purchase
0	i received this seat as a gift for my baby shower , i thought it was going to be a great seat , graco has been on the market for several years , and it 's built up a reputation . but was i wrong ! everytime that i would go out with my newborn , and i would make a turn , the seat would flip over to the side , it did not matter how slow i made the turn it would always do the same thing . i 'm a very carefull driver , specially after i gave birth to my son . you ca n't imagine how horrible it is , to look throuhg the rearview mirror , and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy , has flipped over and his head is hanging . i would have to look for a place to park , and have to fix him and the seat . i had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible , in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest , just so that it would n't tip over , and it made it a little difficult to drive . you might say , she probably did n't install it well , but you would be wrong , it was perfectly installed , i had someone check the installation in my city , and everything was fine . the base of the seat is not completely flat , making it difficult for the seat to stay in place . this did not just happen to me , it also happened to my sister with her baby 's seat , we had our children with a few weeks difference . i had to get a different seat , i purchased one with a flatter base , and that one worked perfectly . i will never buy another graco seat again , i believe it 's worth spending more money on a better seat , i believe ones children are priceless , and investing money in their safety
0	okay , maybe i should have read the laundering instructions , which say to machine wash and then `` drip dry '' - but who makes baby items that ca n't be machine dried ? how many parents have the time to line-dry delicates ? the upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over everywhere - the first time we ever washed it . if you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting , this is not your product . grrr
0	my son used this several times wet all over the floor each time . there is no splash guard on it for boys , but it probably works fine for girls
1	my wife and i like the portable crib quite a bit . it is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper . the price is also not bad at all . the only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable . ( we went to baby depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $ 20 . ) even after buying the extra mattress pad i still think the portable crib was a good buy and i do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all . ( i would buy the crib again if i had to start all over -- our son sleeps quite well in it .
1	i agree with the above reviewers . this rug is large and very well made . perfect in any little girl 's room
1	this seat , along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own , special toilet seat and step for going potty . it has encouraged her to potty train , it fits the toilet seat nicely , and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself . i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty , and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well .
1	after i had my 2nd son , we bought a graco double stoller , but it was so long , heavy and cumbersome that i only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it . we bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and i love it ! great stoller , lightweight , easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back . it 's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too . i wish that i had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment . i highly recommend this stoller , but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller
0	i bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable . it was n't quite what i was expecting , and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that i was looking for . it helped a teeny tiny bit , but the construction is such that it just ca n't provide much support ( it 's a little heavier-weight than a bra , with no additional elastic ) . i bought the other one , by loving comfort , and was thrilled . it 's a little bit more intimidating , perhaps , and less , uh , sexy , but it really works in all the ways that this one did n't . it slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles . ahhhhh
1	i love this pillow . i 've had it for about two and a half months now . at first it helped me stay on my side , and was just comfy to snuggle up to . now that my belly is getting bigger , it gives great support and does n't let my belly `` hang '' down . this is great for people who do n't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep . i 've had no problem with the stuffing . if you are looking for super firm support , try a wedge . this is a pillow , and feels as such . of course , if you are on a budget , you can always just use a regular pillow , but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable . **update** i 'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow ! mine came covered in a zippered cover , so that is what i wash. every few nights , i just grab the larger part and shake it hard until the stuffing falls down , then fluff it and it is as good as new . i also like that , yes , it does take up some room , but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows . all in all , whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice
1	if you are gon na breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow ! ! ! they are awesome and easy . you can wash them , they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere . love it ! ! ! +++
0	these extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper . as it is , the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level . the fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks , which is irritating . they are simple pieces of plastic and should n't add but a dollar or two to arms reach 's cost . there are twelve pieces , so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height . we had to do just that , and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable . it 's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces . what they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights , to prevent too many connections to a bed that 's holding your precious child
1	my twins loved this one so much ... we purchased all styles available at the time
1	i 've had the hippo faucet cover for over six months and i think it 's great ! my son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt . it is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise i think it 's worth it ! the only problem i found with the hippo cover is that it does n't really dispense bubble bath well .
0	i would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool . you do n't have to clean # 2 out of the cup and you 'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink . it really saves a lot of hastle my mother-in-law and i both bought this potty for my daughter . ( one for her house and one for mine . ) it was hard for me to put together , my mo-in-law could n't get it together at all . it makes a loud trumpet sound every time `` water '' passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first , but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died . the other thing i 'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die , they are almost impossible to replace . in order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart , which again is very hard to put back together . we got ours on sale so i do n't mind the expenditure . when you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops ...
1	after checking out all of the boppys , i decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers . i have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it ! it is so soft , and i have washed it a few times with no problems ( i have n't put it in the dryer , though ) . it does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up , etc. , of course , since it is not a waterproof cover . however , i was not expecting it to be waterproof , and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof , so it 's not a big deal to me . since i have the plain white boppy , nothing shows through , but this might be an issue for decorated boppys
1	in my months of 'experimentation ' and a few purchases in err , this is the best product of its sort out there . it 's the only product i 've purchased ( or tried out in the store ) that truly requires only one hand ! with my 8 month old on my shoulder , i drop this bag into the cart seat , i unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket ' over the back , pull the generous , elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that 's just about it . additionally , the buggy bag is among the few that covers the whole cart , and ( uniquely ) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts : one to go around your child 's waist , the other to secure it to the cart . not to be forgotten : the buggy bag comfortable ( apparently ! ) , has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease ! on the other hand , i tried one imitation in a popular baby store and not only did it not open with one hand ( a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot ! ) but i could not get it back into its 'carrying ' shape with two hands ! ! i hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly . eek . another product i purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together , that i could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby . while it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other , they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat . finally adjusted , that product ( the `` shop'n'dine '' ) didnt cover most of the cart . ( on its debut shopping trip ) i threw it back in the car and went home , too tired to shop . finally , there are lots of imitators out there , dont be suckered in by similar names , better price points or preferred fabric choices : the buggy bag will preserve your sanity and , perhaps , your child 's health .
0	this seat is a great concept , it just does n't stay together very well . i took it back to the store and they marked it as `` defective '' . for a few dollars more , i got the `` healthy care booster seat '' from fisher price . i 've had much better luck with it
1	i love this sling ! but i 'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you . it may be too big for your newborn . i started using it when my son was 4 weeks , but he was a large baby . i 've found the key is wear it high ! the instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height . it 's true ! if you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it 's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she 's going to squirm and be uncomfortable . i used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving . now i used it every time i grocery shop because as soon as he 's in it he falls asleep , no matter the time of day . if i try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he 'll start screaming but if i put him in my sling i wo n't hear a peep out of him the whole trip . and you have to admit it 's so cute and stylish ! several people have stopped to ask me where i got it and i love directing them to amazon !
1	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic . i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing . no colic this time , but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top . she follows them around with her eyes . very stimulating for the young ones
0	i loved this item at face value - it looks good , the materials are good quality , it feels secure , and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what i wanted because i planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by . i was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came . well , the `` mattress '' that comes with it is so hard that my baby wo n't sleep in it . she wo n't nap in it , and when i put her down all she does is cry . i 've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would , but she wo n't sleep in it at all . i 've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that i tuck in the sides ( something i do n't want to do because of the sids factor ) and that does n't even help - it 's still too hard of a surface . now , my baby is sleeping in bed with me and i ca n't get any sleep because i 'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed . if they 'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby , this would be a perfect product and i 'd rate it a 5 , but because it 's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board , i have to rate it only 2 stars . i 'm so let down by this product
1	this protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby . otherwise a good product .
1	i ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to florida on vacation ... it is absolutely perfect ... folds small , has room for storage , you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars ... it really is perfect for travel ... actually , it is perfect for anytime .
0	i am unhappy with this product . my newborn baby is 22 '' long and weighs 7 pounds . i purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size . i 've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening . i think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square , this would be prevented . he also can get his arms out of the top . if the velcro strip could be larger , going more toward the back and side of the product , this would not happen . maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many , but i think this would make the product more useable , one size fits all . also , he is long , and the small size was too cramped . i 'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway . i like the product idea and the fabric and construction , ( which is why i gave it 2 stars ) but this product did not work for me . i have recently purchased the first years swaddle blanket , but have issues with that one as well . i am currently searching for one to fit .
1	i have tried these for the first time with my fourth child . i wish i would have used this system for all my children . i have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to vent-air to avent ... many types with my first 3 children . i decided to give these a try considering i was tired of scrubbing bottles . my little girl switched to these very easily from the breast , it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas ( switching from regular formula to soy helped to , plus i had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding ) plus they are so easy to clean and manage . i have had no leak problems like i did with avent ... vent-air # 1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when i tried to switch him to the # 2 nipples ( awful system ) ... absolutely no problems with the original playtex bottles . my only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air ... very hard if you do not have tiny hands . we bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air ... alittle easier . store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners ... i have seen no difference except in price . target brand is very good . i would recommend these bottles to everyone
0	i placed this order on july 25th , amazon 's estimated delivery date is aug 18th-25th . i contacted babyage , and my order wont be sent until the 6th of sept . very disappointed
1	my boys love them . they draw in the car and their cup can sit on it . kinda a pain for short drives , but wonderful for longer trips .
0	this worked great for a couple months . then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise . the gears must be slipping . my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move , then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying . really sad
1	my 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy . he loves putting the little men on top . he does n't play with the toys on the side , guess thats for younger kids , but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention . i find an advantage over the classic fisher price is that he ca n't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated . at this age , i find the alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort . perhaps when he 's older he 'll enjoy the letters as well , but i doubt he 'll still be interested . overall , cute toy that holds his attention while many do not . main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
0	i registered for these bottles i am a new mom and thought the variety was great . we used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick . he would struggle with feeding time . he was so gassy and had horrible reflux , that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry . i did have a recommendation to switch to the dr. brown bottles which made a huge diffrence . however , he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable , their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big . we had gone on a camping trip and i bought the playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning . i also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the dr. brown . so i tried them and my son is doing much better he dose n't even spit up anymore . so if you like the ventair i think you would like the disposable much better . my sons dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but i was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age i wanted to see if i could solve the problem , which i have done completly with the playtex disposable bottles !
0	i am so disgusted that i woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a dora toddler bed . i held the dora toddler bed until christmas , when on christmas eve i went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and i was unable to assemble the bed at all . i ended up returning the bed , in exchange fr nothing . i found out that they no longer carry the bed .
0	well , they say that you get what you pay for . that would be true if you can find this on sale for $ 50 of less ! if you are used to particle board furniture , this will suit you fine . if you have higher standards , spend more and avoid this . some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board . several pieces arrived damaged . we had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it , but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it . if you do buy this and get it assembled , try not to move it around too much , as it may fall apart . also , the drawers are very shallow . do n't expect to store much in this . it did arrive promptly , but the shipper and target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it
1	this is a great pack'n'play . it 's easy to set-up and take any place . the bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that i have . the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby 's attention . my only problem is the piece for the top . whenever i try to use it , the arms bow in and it does n't look very sturdy . i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground . it just does n't seem very sturdy and i have tried everything . other than that , i am glad that i bought this !
0	shoppers beware : the item itself is a great item but i have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders : 1-even though the item is advertised in amazon as new , i received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time . the rocker seat was dirty and smelled . 2-even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping , they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box . therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out . 3-some of the accessories are missing and i can bet the previous owner forgot to return them
0	do n't buy peg-perego their customer service is horrible ! ! i will never buy from them again ! !
1	the safety 1st cosco portable crib is great ! i purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits . it 's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another . i would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib . it is very sturdy and also attractive
0	waste of money . does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this
0	i tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed . the suction wo n't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table . on the kitchen counter top ( formica ) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal . i am returning mine to the store today . dissapointing . but , they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature
0	this is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day . let down happens very quickly and i can get 3 oz . in 15 to 20 min . my baby is a month old and i use this pump so i can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter . geat pump at a great price
1	i discovered this product recently when i had my second baby . i received it as a baby shower gift and i love it . it is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket . i have now bought the large one and my son ( 3mos ) has yet to figure out how to get out of it . the other thing that i like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby 's waist or upper chest , leave his arms out , and use it during the day like a blanket . voila , a blanket that wo n't fall off when you 're holding him , or be kicked off when he 's lying down . kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products . you might also want to check out the piddle pad . another great invention/product by kiddopotamus
1	my daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and i was always worried that she would get cold , especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter . i saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now and i know she stays warm throughout the night . the only suggestion i have for anyone thinking of buying this , is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one . mine is growing so fast that i will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long
0	i recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son . it definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness , however , the problem i encountered with this product is the top portion ( elbow pad ) adhering to the side of the tub . it does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub . the other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub . there was a little moisture on the edge of the tub , the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub . he sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth . there was blood everywhere . his teeth are loose now but should be okay . his lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while . i would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured .
1	i registered for this kit and got two - at first i considered taking one back , but i am glad i did n't . it is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with , that 's months of not having to remember to buy any ! i love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom . the other one is our bib-holder , since we have a ton of bibs . it keeps them neat , all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests . the vapor bath is fantastic . we just got over my son 's first cold and it worked like a charm . he loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes i could hear the difference in his breathing ! when i caught the cold a few days later , i have to admit , i also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion ! i do n't know that the lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby , but it smells nice . we 've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss , so it must not burn . i definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be
