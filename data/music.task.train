0	this is probably the worst cd i have ever bought . it had won some award and just bought it without listening to it , hopping that it would be ok . i listened to it and threw the cd in the trashbin . waist of money or just not my kind of music
1	ah , yes , it 's nirvana 's `` nevermind '' cd , released in 1991 . i listen to all 80 's pop-metal , or hair metal ( whitesnake , winger , van halen , y , dokken ) i could go on forever on 80 's bands . ( of course there is rick springfield , and john cougar mellencamp ) . i am a true rocker here , i know all the true bands out there , i know everything about them . i have reasons for this . but here 's the bottom line . nirvana was a breakthough along with soundgarden and pearl jam back in the early 90 's . millions of people bought those cds . and yes , there were hair bands still alive back then , like poison , and firehouse , etc . firehouse and poison had alot of success , eventhough it was n't the 80 's anymore . as i can see , alot of my fellow rockers do n't really like nirvana , or pearl jam , or soundgarden . to be completely honest , i like their music , i just do n't prefer the music , because i do n't like the hard sound . i really like the glam-hair band style . people say : `` nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal '' . yes , i agree that they killed the 80 's hair bands , but it 's not necessarly their fault . it 's a mix between the bands , and the people listenting to the music . because of grundge music , today 's music is quite horrifying , with emo and other types of music that would 've been a nightmare back in those days . nirvana has a great cd here , but i just do n't prefer it . if you are a real rocker , you 'll listen to all the types of music back then . do n't judge unless you have actually heard it , because you may actually like it . to all rockers- do n't listen to modern music . it 's poisoning our people , and no one really understands the true meaning of `` the guitar '' in today 's music . most of you will understand what i mean , so listen to the classics . classic rock , and hair bands forever , and even grunge . keep the classic alive . ~the sicilian axe ma
0	it 's always good to see an artist change and try new things . back in 2003 when jewel did , it was a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found `` america '' somewhat enjoyable and `` run 2 u '' was also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it 's jewel slowly regaining her musicality . also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next , it will fit her voice well .
1	okay , take everything that you know about john squire . strip away the amazing stone roses first album , the not so amazing follow up , the nice brit pop of his work with the seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and i honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically . they would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful , the vocals might be grating at first ( think robert forster ( the go-betweens ) circa before hollywood ) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving . what you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception . people should listen to it for what it is and not for what john squire was ... john squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do ( who has n't moved on in 13 years ? minus robert smith of course ! ) and now writes beautiful pop songs ... john squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that
0	this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g-funk heyday . warren g. did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before . the skits are ridiculous , the music is halfass , and the lyrics are amateur . there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album . this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w.c. and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's `` it takes a thief '' . one star for the hit single `` summertime in the l.b.c . `` .
0	i heard that song recently `` three strange days '' ... and i recalled how much i detested it when it came out . overt pandering to tyros in altered states . now i ca n't get it out of my head , and may require a lobotomy . there was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91 ; but this was n't part of that canon . nice try school of fish . have fun playing the cyo circuit
0	this is humor ? when does the humor begin ? is it close to the end cause i reckon that this ai n't funny . maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone , i reckin
0	sorry to say i 'm not a huge fan of tanghetto even after seening them play live at la viruta last month . few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while . i say if you want neuvo tango try narcotango or otro aires .
1	... wandering through the dorms in the 1970 's this was one of those albums that was in everyone 's collection . it was usually very near the front of the record stack . every time i hear that opening guitar riff from reelin ' in the years i glide back to a very nice place in time . if you hope to understand the evolution of us pop/rock music you need to become intimate with this recording !
1	it realy has been a long wait after jellyfish . this roger joseph manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get , giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way . if you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel . and do n't wait for the us release : it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the japanese has . i sure would n't want to miss any of these tracks . very higly recommended !
1	very good piece of music history . i still like the lp 's sound a bit better then cd 's due to some of the characteristic noise flaws but unfortunately lp 's do not play in the car .
1	i have followed the enigma project for a long time , and have n't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far . ( that is , considering i am reviewing an older album . ) 'the cross of changes , ' the second chapter in the enigma project , offers philosophical insight into micheal crétu 's personal beliefs , in the form of an 'enigmatic ' symphony of soft composition and chanson . while each album seems to hold it 's own unique interpretation of life , i believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love , peace and wholeness within its listeners . the lyrical value of 'the cross of changes ' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality , which is , at times , rather poor in comparison to some of micheal 's other works . however , the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring , none-the-less , and make the entire experience worthwhile . buyers who are curious about enigma probably should n't start with this album , as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases . ( in my case , at least . ) the first album i purchased was 'love , sensuality , devotion ' ( the greatest hits album ) -- a good start , considering you will get a fair idea of what enigma is all about . by the way , i am curious about track number 2 -- everytime i listen to it , i faintly hear sandra chanting `` open your heart , and push the limits ... '' in the background , though it could just be my imagination . it 's strange that i mention that , because 'push the limits ' was released after this album
1	quem não gosta de samba , bom sujeito não é , é ruim da cabeça ou doente do pé ... essa letra desse samba serve para definir melhor o cd da marisa monte . quem não gostar dele , é doente da cabeça , do ouvido , do corpo , etc . É um trabalho dedicado , na medida certa para esta cantora , verdadeira diva da mpb . recomendo a todos .
0	another torrent of mild tripe from everyone 's `` favourite '' dj , tiesto . what on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane , pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out ? when i think about the number of times i 've heard him touted as `` world 's number one best voted dj '' or `` dj mag top 100 finalist '' , you 'd start to think that the man can actually mix records , when in fact rather than mix them , he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new , unusual and horrendously nauseating forms . i can absolutely confirm this . i have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live . the sad truth of the matter is , that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there , and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this . or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas . i sign off in disgust
1	this has been my first cd of rod stewart and i am very proud to have this cd , because worth every penny . this cd has class . congratulations to the men behind . the duet with cher `` bewitched , bothered bewildered '' is the best song.duet with queen latifah `` as time goes by , '' i was astonish , she has a nice voice too ! ! . all songs are relaxings . actually , i listen this cd before to go bed
1	if you want to learn about texas music just buy this disc . tom 's love of life and artist 's eye infect every song . the opening number `` tonight we ride '' is hard to beat . he sang it on david letterman 's show ( paul shaffer played the accordian ! ) . letterman described it as a `` song that will make you want to saddle up a horse , ride up to connecticut and rob a liquor store . '' me , i just went out and bought some good reposado gold . letterman 's got a point , though- the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other . my other favorites are bucking horse moon , and all this way for a short ride . tom russell is true american artist like woody guthrie or pete seeger , and this is one of his best .
0	long studio sessions . if you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way , then this is it . if you do n't , get near the beginning or rock roll . get some of their quality stuff . this definitely is n't it
0	david bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial . this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial . a disco-esque record , it 's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time . it has some good moments , but overall the production is just too slick and there 's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song , cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro , meaning there 's a grand total of five new songs on it . china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie 's melodramatic vocals , cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you 're ( nearly ) always gon na get at least one classic on a bowie album . ironically , while it made him a global megastar , this record also marked the start of bowie 's alarmingly swift fall from grace . if he 'd stuck to the highly original work he 'd churned out before this , he 'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway ... and nobody could have accused him of selling out . now , what 's that they say about hindsight
1	the edward scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores . i truly believe this is danny elfman 's best score and believe me , he 's done some great scores ! the music is so moving . the childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet , beautiful film . even people who have n't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials . a must-have for any danny elfman and/or tim burton fan
1	i appreciate bands like ima robot , film school and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into alternative music , or at least i appreciate film school for trying to merge the beauty of electronica with alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the new wave you loved in the 80 's . the thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band . have you heard depeche mode 's albums with a wind of boards of canada ? call this the album that it would have made more sense for maximo park to create if you will but this album is america 's response to all other international bands showing us off hard . ( the band is from san francisco , i believe ) and their influence for this album is a mix of electronica and 80 's music ( my bloody valentine . new order ? depeche mode ? ) all leading them to create an album that does n't quite call the band in question an american radiohead per se , but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars , accompanying keyboards , and a leaders effort to push the band forward , a band that is trying to reach heights of originality . film school 's debut ( if you are n't counting their imported ep ) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating `` on and on '' that may force your urge to name this band after interpol and elefant and a little bit of the bravery in there , too , but will not let you throughout this entire album . their current single `` pitfalls '' may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back new wave these days , but worse can happen for a band like this . the backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference . the second actual interlude `` garrison '' is where boards of canada 's wind starts blowing through the cd , before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of `` cool '' . if there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of new wave and the health of alternative , i do n't see a better candidate for leg-ups than film school 's latest . rating : 7.5/1
1	if you like late 60s british rock-psych , tough-not-fey production/vibe , white-soulful vox , and mixing electric/acoustic elements ( think : a cross among beatles + zombies + traffic + small faces , even a lil ' byrds feel occasionally ) , you shimply musht try rolled gold , which compares to the cream of these groups ' output ! ! - '' the ac-who- '' ! ? you might well say ... 'where have they been all our life ? ' ; 'a gem beyond price has languished all these years unsavored , ' we repeat nearly speechless . not since our belated introductions to moondog ... skip bifferty ... billy nicholls ... stones ' `` metamorphosis '' ... dantalian 's vehicule ... it can easily be yours . we very rarely care to replay any c.d . over and over but this one warrants such : well-crafted blend of nonchalance poetry and passion , delicacy and yarbles , hooks and chops and pacing and songs up there with the legends . the news that this cohesive album was only demo's* ( 'haps fortuitous in retrovision ) catapults one 's estimation higher still . singer reg king : on rolled 's strength his visage deserves a spot on some rushmore-in-avalon alongside fellow soulful brits winwood/ marriott/ reid/ lloyd/ stewart ... : just hoarse enough/just sweet enough ( + a 'secret ' : optimal use throughout of unison doubletracking ) ... perfection . rolled gold 's production is on the raw/monoish/hotly-compressed side -- a flute/piano occasionally to augment the basic guitar quartet formula keep things unexpected -- suiting the songs performances to a tee ( just to offer another clue to their magic brew ) . homey 's in no way related to any bandmember..
1	this album grabbed my attention from the first measure . thick and heavy , this is not like any blues album i 've ever heard . very atypical for hidalgo as well . this one is probably an acquired taste- one for the truly hard core blues fan . the sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start , and the more i listen to it , the more i like it . i can only hope there 's a houndog 2 in the works..
1	sam moore 's new cd is a welcome return to the roots of soul . this cd has got it ! sam 's voice is superb and the duets he does with his guests are wonderful . i 'm not a fan of country music so i was a bit fearful of what wynona and travis tritt would do with sam . wow ! are they ever good ! wynona 's got it . i 'm going to listen to more of her now . the musicians are the best ! i thought i could hear that wonderful touch of earth wind and fire on some of the numbers so i went searching the notes . sure enough -- there is reggie young -- the wonderful earth wind and fire trombonist ! go reggie ! billy preston is wonderful on `` you are so beautiful '' as is the accompanying guitar by eric clapton . this is a musician 's cd -- quality all the way . i have had the great pleasure of seeing sam moore and billy preston in person ( with bowzer 's doo wop party -- thank god for bowzer , bringing back all these wonderful artists ) and they were wonderful . i 'd love to see even more of sam moore . thanks to randy jackson for putting this together . this is a class-act .
1	i like the main voice ( s ) and i like the music , but the voices are over powered by the music . if they turned up the voices a bit i think this would be a great album . this album does not sound like other albums i have so i 'm not sure what to compare it to .
1	they may have a new name , but their sound remains the same as before . mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style , the liks have crafted the perfect party cd . tracks like `` run wild '' ( possibly the best track on the cd , certainly the most fun to listen to ) , `` sickness '' ( with butch cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook ) , and the neptunes-produced `` best u can '' showcase the liks ' party appeal , while head-nodders like `` bully foot '' ( with busta rhymes ) and `` another round '' create a more relaxed vibe for the listener . the liks also get outside help from artists like fellow likwit-crewmember defari ( `` my dear '' ) and kurupt ( the cleverly-titled `` promote violins '' ) . of course , xzibit holds it down on his two tracks , `` bar code '' and `` 151 '' . the only way this cd differs from their last releases is the instruments , varying from violins ( `` promote violins '' ) , trumpets ( `` l-i-k-s '' ) , and even 40 ounce bottles ( `` 40 oz . quartet '' skits ) . the thing you should n't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions ( go grab mobb deep ) . however , copping `` x.o . experience '' could be the best refreshment for this summer 's heat . if you like `` x.o . experience '' , check out : `` xzibit - restless '' , `` alkaholiks - likwidation '' , `` kurupt - space boogie '' , `` eastsidaz - ducez & amp ; trayz
0	this soundtrack was `heart-brokenly ' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film . i bought this soundtrack for one specific song ( and it would 've been worth every penny if only it was included ) : the song near the end when alexander marches through the desert to return home to babylon after his recovery . such a disappointment that was n't included . in the other hand , i 'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included . i particularly liked `` roxane 's veil '' even though i do n't recall hearing it in the film .
1	i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time . there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re-released . if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia , this is the set for you !
0	who the **ck are gnr ? ? plus they make awful music ! i ca n't stand this annyoing album . the music is awful , so as the lyrics . there is not one good song on this piece of s**t. it is a album that contains 12 crappy songs . axl rose is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly , and slash is terrible too . in the way stay away from this as well as gnrs other albums . leave gnr alone ... .gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks gnr sucks . i recommend buy these albums insted . foreigner 4 love over gold-dire straits on every street-dire straits combat rock-the clash how to dismantle an atomic bomb-u2 american idiot-green day animal magnetism-scorpions load-metallica reload-metallica and justice for all-metallica master of puppets-metallica ride the lightning-metallica self title black album-metallica past masters vol 2-beatles physical graffiti-led zeppelin some girls-the rolling stones greatest hits-neil young the last dj-tom petty -gnr are as bad as pink floyd , pearl jam , nirvana , and ac/dc . avoid all albums from those bands .
1	i have to tell you lionel hampton has yet to be matched in talent , and drive on the `` phones . '' funny story , it was tito puente the late and legendary `` king of the mambo '' was the one who showed lionel ( by carefull persuation ) the light of the `` phones '' and shuned him away from the piano . unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but i believe they meet in the service or right after tito was discharged for ww ii . i can tell you lionel , to me , is best know for his big version of `` flying home '' . a bigger , badder version of the small groups version he did with benny goodman , and teddy wilson . lionels closest match would have to be red narrvo form the 1930 's , but still mr. hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched
0	the track selection is fine and okay , but the track order is bad . no flow ! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile . the mixing is terrible and abrupt , its basically not mixing . no art there .
0	bill charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented , lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today . he has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences . that told , i find it very hard to give his latest effort , stardust , more than two stars . with very few exceptions , i found this cd to be fairly self-indulgent and charlap rather morose in his intrepretations . it was n't nearly a refeshing to the ear as written in the stars . i would recommend this for a charlap devotee but no one else . he has made better albums
0	just saw the video for this while flicking . the song talks about london bridge going down and everything but the bridge is fixed , it does n't go up or down with the video showing tower bridge . so bit of a mix up there . petty maybe but just thought it should be pointed out
0	this is anything but soothing . the tone is too high pitched ; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky carmel coastline that i was hoping for . i did buy the twofer and got the ocean surf cd by dan gibson and found it much more relaxing , even though it is n't a tumbling surf sound . i was able to fall asleep ... which was my goal . now if i could only return ocean waves .
1	this is one of those rare cds that you 'll leave in your car cd player for months and not get tired of , because it fits most moods . feels like melissa etheridge meets cheryl crow , with an old blues feel here and there , and some nice , heavy tori amos-like piano and vocals here and there too
0	i 've always held the philosophy you are what you 're entertained by . so , those who like ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women . and speaking of women ... ludacris never met one who was n't a h-o . ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men : you demean and look down on women for being h-oes , yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you 'll have no problems getting laid . but then , you 're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you , so you go and find a `` nice girl '' because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her . but then you cheat on her with a `` bad girl '' because h-oes need h-oes ; but then you ca n't respect the `` bad girl '' because she 's a slut , so you go back to the `` good girl . '' but she 's not nasty enough for you , so then ... around and around we go . women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us . he 's obsessed with sex and h-oes . it makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it . maybe ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever . i guess if she had actually raised him and shown him how to respect women -- all women -- then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is . what 's the music like ? well i 'll give him 2 stars for mentioning tlc in what 's your fantasy . that 's it . addendum : 7/27-07 some may wonder why i 'm `` wasting ' my time giving ludacris negative reviews . well , first of all , if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it , everything on amazon would have 5 stars , which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality . secondly , i do n't like ludacris . i would give ludacris more respect if i felt he gave my gender more respect ; but he does n't . my diatribe above shows what my problem with him is , and i feel that argument is valid . there 's no way to critique ludacris ' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women . why should i like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us ? i 'm biased against him because he 's biased against me . so he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e
1	i first heard this album in the late 6o 's when it was originally released . starting with the first track , `` blood of the sun '' , i was hooked . leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure . his throaty singing and driving band , featuring felix pappalardi , made this band one that should be placed on the list of `` great ones '' . probably due to the many other better publicized bands , like led zeppelin and the like , leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet . open the closet , you guitarists out there , and give this cd a try . i do n't think you will be anything but delighte
1	i have listened to this cd for the last several years before going to sleep at night . i love classical music , and this is great music to help make my soul feel at peace and unwind after a taxing day .
1	i just refreshed my ears listening to `` riot '' again ! getting to to hear 1/2 full , which clocking in at just over 4 minutes , is sheer electric blues magic . the price of this album is worth this one rocker alone . it was nice to see it on `` easy street '' ( along with lukin ' excellent ! ) any way this number totally kicks ! definitely get this if you do n't already own it .
1	basie 's best players come to duke 's place , the columbia records 30th street studios in 1961 and face ellington 's finest . not a battle , but not quite a merger , either , since the count 's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel . there 's more than an hour of good music on here , laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras . popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible . this is one of those rare cd 's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music . this one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session , one of ellington 's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague . also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics . basie hated columbia 's first idea to bill the date as a competition , and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art . the end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name . the cover finally chosen says `` the count meets the duke '' but in larger letters it declares `` first time ! '' and then adds `` 2 great orchestras '' and finally states `` duke ellington and count basie . '' the label columbia/sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says `` duke ellington meets count basie '' which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20 's . if you already like both orchestras , you 'll want to own this late career session . if you want an introduction to each group in its waning years , the cd serves nicely for that , too . this disc really jives , so do n't be expecting any ballads here
0	nana has a beautiful voice , but her singing is monotonous , predictable . she lacks passion . sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song . in addition to this , the arrangements are unfortunately very poor . her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra . only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles , but this is not the album i would like to listen to again and again
0	this is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected . lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself . then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie , the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper . queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music . this is ridiculous ! kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game . please please please spare us and stop rapping
1	i thought this album was good not great , but saying that i do recomend it to everyone because it does have some great songs it . the best songs on the cd to are . 2 . comfortable liar 3 . send the pain below 4 . closure 5 . the red 6 . wonder what 's next and my favorite track is # 2 it sounded so sweet , you will love that song
0	i agree with the other negative review below- uninspired , simply forgettable radio trash . cliched lyrics ? check . muddy , simple riffs ? check . boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks ? check . thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back . if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself . judging from all the `` positive '' reviews however , it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves ( if they 're still around . i hope not . ) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music .
0	before you get all worked up , let me say that he has a voice , but he really does n't have a style . he sings songs way too straight , he makes even bobby short sound like an improviser ! he also does n't seem to be in touch with his masculine side , his vocie is very , well if ying is male , and yang is female , he sounds very yang . he needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he wo n't sound so obnoxious , then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying ( masculine side ) in his voice . he needs to hear a few billy eckstine lp 's . i do n't think he can change but here 's hoping he 'll take my advice . as far as you buying this cd it is your decision , this is just my honest opinion
0	hey , that just goes without being said . all of their live albums suck because they suck . go creed ! i ca n't wait for scott stapp 's solo album ! awesome , baby
0	is this the same kool keith that created dr. octagon , dr. dooom , and black elvis ? `` spankmaster '' represents a regression of creative energy . it sounds like keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks . it contains little of the genius of his earlier cds . with the exception of a couple songs ( `` jewelry shine '' and `` blackula '' ) , this album stinks
0	i 'm a big fan of great big sea and i purchase everything they release . apparently they were trying to give this cd the `` feel '' of a live , medium-size venue performance . unlike their other live dc offerings , this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan 's front pocket . it does n't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound . overall , i was pretty disappointed and i 'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one .
0	will not run on my computer ... love the content however i keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my mp3 . i will be demanding a refund ! do not buy if you have a mp3 supported car stereo , if you plan on playing at your computer.. it will not work due to ill conceived piracy protection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	being a huge blondie fan , i want to rate this one higher , but sadly i can not . it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs , it feel very negligant too . i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco , but their calypso number on this one is so awful . they had lost it here . check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat..
0	this cd was a big seller upon it 's release in 1992 , boasting a plethora of big hits , along with some new songs . looking back through 2005 eyelids , it 's hard to hear why these songs were so huge ... .the cd starts off well , with hits from the primitive love album , but as one keeps listening , he realizes that none of these songs have passion or depth , a few catchy melodies and pleasant , if plain vocals . the dance numbers at least keep you awake , but the years 1988-92 found estefan leaning on ballads , and one was barely distinguishable from another ; on top of that , the 4 new cuts feel like padding , to fill a cd 's worth of material for a christmastime release ... a couple of hits are missing , too ( i.e. , bad boys ) , so to summarize , nothing truly bad here , but precious little on target ...
0	my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs . for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews . i have all 19 halos , and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos , and i love all of it , including the entirety of the fragile , fixed , perfect drug versions , still , further down the spiral v1 and v2 , the deluxe edition of the downward spiral , on and on , everything ... . except deep . deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having . painfully uninspired and recycled , musically , lyrically , and visually ( the video was an embarassment- again , the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing , beautiful brilliance ) , deep is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely . my advice : take it as a mark that he is , after all , human , but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack , unpaid for , for it will never show up on an official halo as burn ( originally for natural born killers ) , dead souls ( joy division cover originally for the crow ) , and the perfect drug ( originally for lost highway ) all have in time ( the former two on halo 8 de and the latter on halos 11 , 12 , and 15 in extended form )
0	first off that has to be the worst rhyme i 've ever heard in my life ... andre nickatina ( in the rapping world ) is one of the worst i 've ever heard , but if you 're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them ( reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves , paddling every which way to stay with them ) , and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says ( what feels like ) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night . but overall , `` if you ca n't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ai n't able '' summs this and the rest of the nickatina c.d.s up
1	watching the melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining . they began as an unassuming punk band , and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70 's rock into their sound . then they stripped away any and all of the `` punk '' trappings and went for pure heavy . it all culminated with this record . it just does n't get any heavier than 'roman bird dog/hung bunny ' . 'with teeth ' , rumored to actually be written by joe preston , is one of my all time favorite melvins songs . speaking of joe preston , he was the by far best of the melvins ' 7000+ bassists they had over the years . shame they got rid of him shortly after this album . as soon as they fired him , they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity hell . bad karma . thank god that rock bands record their music so that it is n't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions . the only song on this record which i do n't like is the cover of alice cooper 's 'the ballad of dwight fry ' . thankfully they made up for it with a cover of flipper 's 'sacrifice ' . some of the melvins ' subsequent records have their moments ( stoner witch 's 'shevil ' , stag 's 'cotton mouth ' ) , but for the most part it seems to me that the melvins gave up the ghost after recording this . maybe someday they 'll make a comeback
0	this is as bad as the film.in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula.will & amp ; his movies & amp ; music never change the same old beat.the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad.unoriginal & amp ; boring.what a waste of kool moe dee
0	i understand why so many people like dido..she is beautiful , has a decent voice , comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive ... this album is the same - 'inoffensive ' ... some might say , bland ... the tracks that work for me are 'thank you ' ( used on eminem 's 'stan ' ) , but is done solo here and it works , 'hunter ' and 'here with me ' ... the rest just disappear into the background like a passing car ... nothing much happens , nothing inspires ... i really want to like her , but it 's all been done before..
1	i read some of the other reviews before i submitted this . i do n't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes . redd does n't include danny gatton as an influence because he did n't listen to him . as far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire , well , i do n't even know how to address that . redd has one of the best tones i 've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers . ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar ? well , you wo n't get that on this cd because redd does n't play something to just play it . this cd showcases redd 's versatility from country , to swing , to blues , to rock , it has it all . if you like good pickin ' , then by this cd
1	pinback blows me away . i consider my taste in music to be very diverse , with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop , from the last three decades ( talk talk , split enz to elliot smith and death cab ) . pinback delivers some of the best , most consistent music i 've heard in years . i started with summer in abaddon and was weak in the knees , then i acquired their debut album and could barely stand ... and now , blue screen life has about knocked the breath right out of me . i have n't gotten through the entire back catalog because i ca n't stop listening to the three albums i have in my hands . words can not express how fascinating this band is - intricate complicated with a simple , straightforward delivery . their transitions are sick . they put their contemporaries ( death cab , the shins , the killers ) to shame . i love all of the aforementioned bands , but pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived , perfectly executed , diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back , over over . how many albums can you say that about ? they are heavenly . the standouts are xiy , boo , concrete seconds , bbtone , prog , pene ... oh , screw it - every song is great !
1	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try . i am happy with all of the tracks . some tracks remind me of beatles a little , but not all , so the band does have a unique sound . even though from the 90s , the sound is like many bands making it today . i like it .
1	grew up on this group . love them then and love them now . own the `` best of '' collection but you can never compile the best on one cd . for those winans fans you know what i 'm talking about . these brothers are music genuises especially marvin winans . like stevie wonder they were ahead of their time . my favorite song on this album shares the message of all times . `` together we stand '' opens up the eyes to all race , religion , and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background . entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as stevie wonder , teddy riley , and aaron hall . i like the flavor the cameos add to this album . if you 're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase
1	it 's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that xtc 's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70 's first wave of british punk rock . those were different times , after all . you could n't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky , spastic wit of `` white music '' . come to think of it , not many people could make much sense of it back then , either . andy partridge 's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than `` pop '' , and barry andrews ' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song . nevertheless , the album worked . it rocked in its own art-damaged way , and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation . that lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the fab four 's `` hard day 's night '' was cleverly appropriated for the intro to `` this is pop '' . a few songs later dylan 's `` all along the watchtower '' got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia . there may have been more intense punk artifacts from the class of '78 , but not many were anywhere near as smart as `` white music ''
1	there is nothing more intimate then the human voice . i am a voice major at a university . nothing speaks to me more highly then choral music . i was a little skeptical about this cd when i first got it . i have since fallen in love with every aspect of it . of course if you get this cd you must get the companion cd lux aeterna by the los angeles master chorale . you can not have one without the other
1	what can i say about vince gill that his many fans have n't already mentioned . i had never been particularly interested in country music . but , one day i was listening to a country radio station and vince gill was singing `` when ever you come around '' and i was hooked . this cd is as consistant as all his others . great lyics and superb musicianship . i rate this five stars as i believe gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today
0	ok ... ... avoid this at all costs not worth your money ! ! ! ! as luck would have it i found it a a garage sale . the only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is vivi 's theme from ff9 . the others well ... .they could have done better . most of the songs are to put it nicely ... ... suck ( at least the way they where done ) . the only reason i rated 2 ( 1 1/2 to be accualy ) is because of vivi 's theme at the end . this is not whorth your time . get the imported cd 's they have much better music on them
1	i just love lynch mixed with dooms production . it is what real is
0	just another cd of the awful , awful techno-crud that has infested goth/industrial clubs , while real artists like cinema strange and knifeladder get the shaft . worthless on every level
1	i love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and if you do too , this is the album you must listen to ! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous ( and the most beautiful of the entire cd ! ) `` award tour '' , `` steve birko ( stir it up ) '' and `` midnight '' . enjoy this pearl of real hip-hop ! ! !
1	i never loved a man the way i love you , what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time . this album released all of the music in aretha that was screaming to be released . it displayed a very mature aretha with complex emotions , very everyday lyrics , ones that make you say , oh yeah girl , lol . but also a delivery that the average person could n't lay down and dream about pulling off . this is just testiment that , even at such a young age , she was the queen
1	the most juiced-up sountern rock around . check out the tango guitar on `` too hard to handle '' and i always get a kick out of rick 's ole ' man . it 's a shame that there are n't bands like this around today .
0	so far , so good ... so what ! ( in it 's origional form ) used to conjure feeling . the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did n't quite hit the nail on the head . if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s , get your hands on that version .
1	this album is absolutely beautiful . the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match . it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album , but this one makes the cut . each song wraps you in a warm trance , a coccoon of well-being . it has a really positive emotional effect on me . it creates an ambiance of gentle strength . wonderful . i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums
0	like the other reviewer of this cd , i am also a fan of buffalo tom . unfortunately this does n't sound very similar to bt , in fact it is a bit dull . none of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it . i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair , since i only played it 3 times , hoping it would grow on me . i 'd recommend `` up here '' instead of this one , it 's much more listener friendly
0	tony kushner 's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his jew-hatred-soaked script for the film `` munich . '' a paragon of self-regard , he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the jewish people 's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland . rather , kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony ( through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement , prior to wars of justifiable self-defense ) . like his evil arab idols , kushner can not abide the concept of a restored jewish commonwealth , secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy , political independence , and territorial sovereignty . zionism , and its morally necessary outcome the state of israel , enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of jewish culture in the us in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the klezmatics have been frolicking and where kushner has gained his fame and fortune . but kushner hates the very thought of being liberated , and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world jewry . the klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide .
1	hot hot heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest . their first release was decent , but `` elevator '' is even better . great tunes , drums and guitars - and , of course , steve bays ' yelping vocals . there 's only three songs i really do n't care for - `` pickin ' it up '' , `` soldier in a box '' and `` shame on you '' . looking forward to the next cd
0	presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a prince album or two but do n't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection . the way this is laid out though is confusing at best : disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable . ( `` my name is prince '' ? his take on `` nothing compares 2 u '' when sinead o'connor 's is definitive ? ) disc 2 compiles 12 '' mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e . for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat his purpleness every records . bottom line : this is haphazardly thrown together . middle range fans are better off with the hits/the b-sides which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material ( some of which equals his singles )
0	i hate the beatles . they are amongst my music guide top 20 worst bands ever . they only made a few decent songs in hey jude , let it be , and ballad of john and yoko . rest of their songs just stink ! even a mark knopfler cd without dire straits is better than this ! like i said , anyone who listens to the beatles or zeppelin do n't know what good music is about , huh ! ! ! good music is required dire straits , green day , foreigner , gnr , metallica , and nirvana . get any album from those bands insted . the beatles suck ! ! ! !
0	i love milton nascimento 's early work ( `` travessia '' and `` clube da esquina '' ) , but this does not reach that level by far . my main objection is that it does not live up to the promise delivered by the famous names of the participants like herbie hancock , wayne shorter , pat metheny a.o . `` vera cruz '' is ok , but the rest is just too pretentious . just as a warning to all brazilian music lovers out there : this is certainly not a must have , apart from die hard milton fans . i would rather recommend to check out the latest releases by fellow brazilian caetano veloso ( `` livro '' and `` prenda minha '' ) , because they are really indispensable
1	dylan ... along with late nobel prize winning czeslaw milosz ... may someday be recognized as preeminent prophet-poet of decadent pm west . milosz [ in tradition of towering european mystic/gnostic intellectual poet/philosophers ( blake-swedenborg to solovyov and dotoyevsky ) ] ranks amid a brotherhood summoning mankind to recollection-in-reckoning and hopeful repentance where the good may be rescued , reaffirmed and rejuvenated for all.america 's modern isaiah , bob '' dylan '' zimmerman the jokerman 's jokerman is unique to the usa ( and the world ) as post-modernism 's john-the-b prophet minstrel . the slow train is apocalypse now ! coming at warp speed.our political-circus clown neroes ( tweedle dees dums ) continue fiddling as union 's sundown `` auto de-fe of the usa '' feeds maws of moloch with aborted children ; orwellian schools and inbred culture of spiritual , moral and pseudo-intellectual manques who celebrate death as ultimate freedom and anti-salvation.infidels pulls no punches : the jokerman 's final battle with the man of'peace'has begun . pc `` neighborhood bullies '' have begun worldwide assault from the middle east to local american classroom ...

0	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar , i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc . was n't worth the effort , i 'm afraid . velveeta on wonder bread-dull collection of acid jazz duds . not bad as background noise for your next dinner party , but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act . a pass for all but galactic completeists , if such an animal exists
1	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker . his band rocked ! after basie , nobody swung like mcshann . this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides . anything by this man is worth listening to . another great disc by the proper label , who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price . highly recommended
0	i bought kayslays pain from the game about a week before it came out in most stores ( my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule ; ) . i read that it featured production by swizz beatz , kanye west , eminem and the heatmakerz . and as far as rappers go , most of the shady/aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists ( fat joe , ghostface killah , raekwon , scarface , memphis bleek and prodigy , etc ) . so i expected this cd to be a big step up from the streetsweeper volume 1 mixtape ( which i would give 3 stars at best ) . but for all the talent on this cd there 's not many good songs . i thought the production was pretty weak . some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west , swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland . if you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made , grab this disc . if your looking for good music leave this one alone
1	i absolutely loved the string music on track 3 . i remembered it from an old pc rpg called quest for glory iv . i was disappointed to find out that track 4 was only a minute and a half long , because i grew up loving that song from the various places i heard it ( fantasia and a kid detective pc game from the late 80 's ) . overall , though , grieg 's greatest hits is a must-have for collectors of classical music . grieg is revered as norway 's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines .
0	most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from martina . what a waste of money to buy this album of mostly `` old '' songs and only a few new ones ! martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard-working individuals . maybe she should try getting a real job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish luxurious lifestyle . many of us are living in trailer parks working 80 hours a week while martina sitting on her a** in her million dollar house making money like rain ! you , the people who are buying her albums are making her rich ... what the hell is wrong with you people ? do n't buy her albums and let her get a freakin ' job so she can feel what it 's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar ! martina , quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle
1	i bought this cd yesterday and i immediatly knew it was going to rock ! after hearing the title track , go ! , i knew this cd was going to be different then the spice girls cds . it is better . my favorite songs are never be the same again , ga ga , and goin down .
1	first of all bob dylan is certainly not for everyone . however , if his style is up your alley this is a classic . you can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like `` lay lady lay '' or `` like a rolling stone '' to name a couple . planet waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully . this is probably my favorite dylan album and i have all the `` classics '' like blonde on blonde , blood on the tracks , highway 61 revisited . ect . i 'd recommend this to any dylan fan
0	[ first of all : i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower ] i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it , leaving me to pick it up . i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning . if you buy this , consider yourself warned
1	imagine yourself sitting in a bistro on the champs elysees , sipping a nice glass of bordeux as your glance pulls you toward an alluring ... . you get the picture . now buy the cd and thank me later ! highly recommended from someone who thought they heard it all ! bravo senor douglas
0	yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that `` tub thumping '' is okay , even if it `` gets old after awhile '' . that song is crap ! ! ! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play . ever ! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they 're trying to market in the states . that song ( if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song ) makes the strongest argument against anarchy that i 've ever heard . proves that people who ca n't agree on anything ca n't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme . got ta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel
1	at the end of the day , when you come home from school or work , one ca n't say `` i feel great . '' rather than great , we are stressed and tired . the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly . i too , am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain ; and it does work . it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping . with quiet , natural sounds , it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you
1	i 'm not sure what to call this cd other than genius . this was the first cd i 've heard from sonata arctica and it 's still my favorite . i 'm not really really big on power metal/epic metal , but i defintely enjoy sa and kamelot . with that said , i think this cd can even entertain those not interested in power metal . my friend enjors radio rock and rap , but after hearing me play this cd where we work , he begged me to make him a copy . towards the actual cd , i 'm not quite sure i can put what 's in it into words . songs like silver tongue and broken have a very distinct , unique sound . the ballads , draw me and the misery are both superb efforts , each making the listener feel tony kakko 's pain . my favorite song would have to be a dead heat between the misery and gravenimage . the keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song . he plays fast , and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting ( and lighthearted at times ) . the guitarist plays very fast when he needs to , and the right power chords other times . he 's quite good . overall , the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking . they do a great job . the lyrics seem much better than older releases ( english lessons ? ) but still can be a bit odd . `` ... with long haired drummer in band '' springs to mind . still at least they write about mundane things ... i love kamelot , but the knight in shining armor routine will get old eventually . anyway , the vocals are very well done , he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well , too . ( they 'd make queen jealous ! ) overall , i ca n't praise this cd enough . every song is an adventure , none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that . i would say that anyone could enjoy this cd , but i 'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the american screamfest metal that 's going on today . then i 'd recommend it to power metal fans , and so on . simply put , this is one of the best cds i own . give it a chance
0	i ca n't beleive this guy 's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be sinatra 's domain . any idiot will tell you that once sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him . fact . ask tony bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you . sinatra is the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better . not only does he murder 'a very good year ' but also attempts ( badly ) 'mr . bojangles ' even attempting to ape sammy davis 's mannerisms . i had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a ) a joke or b ) a blantant attempt by williams to crossover to boarder appeal . now i see it actually meant it . robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please do n't attempt the rodgers and hart songbook ( though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs ) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover ca n't cover up your mediocrity . the only time i 'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost . stick with 'songs for swinging lovers '' come fly with me ' to hear the real thing . an insult to classic songs
1	in august 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group . main singer was tony burrows of ivy league and flowerpot men fame . the first success came with the second single united we stand . this cd collects together the three us hits of the session group plus the only us hit of the group that was the face of the session group in concert during 1971-1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group , the eurovision winning song save your kisses for me . the rest of the songs are a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974-1980 . this outfit is still on tour at the end of the centur
0	this was o.k . nothing more nothing less . this album was hard to review , beacuse no songs really stick out . i mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes , laced over just above mediocre beats . i have heard better sesame street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van . i mean what does the album have that sticks out ? `` saturday to saturday '' ? `` bloody horseshoe '' ? or the multi- faceted `` boo , we ai n't forgot about you '' none of the above , or none on the album . sorry . and please , all angry people who think that this is a bad review , remember , it 's a review . i can say what i want
0	i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour . in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour . again , the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again . i find most of this album to be very average . actually after listening , this album is not very good at all . the majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics . there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably `` safe in new york city '' which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic . probably one of the bands weakest efforts
1	`` the guitars are n't loud enough , and neither is the bass for that matter '' which is so true , but it 's still a great album . seeing them live , makes up for this cd no doubt . stand out songs : -the city sleeps in flames -the world as we know it -just a taste -my darkest hour -empty glasses -the only medicine 'my darkest hour ' 'empty glasses ' are my favorites . i know those songs by heart
1	i have to say i was getting worried that john adams was becoming a has-been . el nino 's first half was much better than the second , i did n't particularly like transmigration and i defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work american berserk and tell me it 's any good . but after this release , i stand humbly corrected -- he 's still , in my opinion , america 's , if not the world 's , best living composer . dharma at big sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that 's not well-tempered . what really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style i 've never heard before in classical music . the first movement `` a new day '' with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it 's the creation of an entire universe . the climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of adams 's works to date . dharma is an absolute masterpiece . my father knew charles ives is wonderful too , even if it 's not as powerful or moving as dharma . the work is both an homage to ives and a reflection of adams ' life . clearly , adams had a great childhood . the first movement , concord , is playful -- the clearest tribute to ives , since it 's sounds structurarlly similar to his fourth of july . the chaos in adams ' concord is a little more rigid than ives ' , but it 's still fun . the second movement , `` the lake '' , features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer 's father . the scurrying of the last movement , `` the mountain '' , seems needlessly frenetic at times , but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it . my one bone to pick is with nonesuch . the two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music -- an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single cd , especially when other works like guide to strange places go unrecorded . so why put these two works on 2 cds ? is it to justify the $ 20 sticker price ? an artistic statement to completely separate the two works ? it just seems silly . but it 's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute cds that really should stop . people want to hear the astonishing sound world that adams creates -- why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time ? buy this disc , even if it 's split into 2 pieces . it 's the best of his works yet
0	these covers are pretty bad . some good ones have been done , cameron mcgill @ the uncommon ground tribute , big sir 's everybody here wants you is good , but this is bad , no matter what entertainment weekly 's review might say . avoid , buy a real jeff or tim album
1	excellent songwriting , guitar playing and overdubbing . another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive . days dawning , crying clown , fanfare are a few such songs . a few songs from wind of change , something 's happening , and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i 'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment
0	never shipped . i ordered this before christmas . they said it was in stock . where is it
1	my one complaint is that after i listen to this cd , the catchy tunes get stuck in my head ! and then i want to keep listening to it more and more . i love the selections on this cd , the fact that the songs are in english ( i always wondered what the `` figaro , figaro , figaro '' song was about ! ) , and that a little background is given to each piece as well
1	i can not stop listening to the song i saved the world today . the cd is worth the price for this song alone . the whole cd is great though ... classic eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work . annie lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit , but dave stewart certainly deserves as much . they make a great team and this cd should have been given much more attention in the usa . i hope they do n't take so long to do another one
0	unfortunately i was extremely unhappy after listening to the album . unlike many other altan fans , i view maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career . the problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place . and the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like `` well i guess we have to put a few instrumentals on '' kind of effort . i 'm sorry , but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs . she is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and inspired arrangements made them for me the top irish folk group . alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels , jigs , etc . i miss frankie kennedy 's flute too . goodbye altan , your best day 's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days
1	if you 're a strummer fan who is an historical completist then you 'll want this disc . also , there are some really good tunes on here for anyone , particularly joe 's `` keys to your heart '' . some of the live material here is high quality and some is not . this is likely not a cd you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh . but , i 'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as i 've always wanted to hear it and as a joe fanatic , i had to have it . there 's moments here that sound like a rough draft of js and the mescaleros , but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70 's with some great guitar solos . if joe had not been where uk punk started after this band there 's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he 'd have kept playing in a band . i 'm a huge clash and strummer fan , but i rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content
1	this is such an good industrial album , that i was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that i wanted to use seemed not good enough . however , if i have to put one then it has to be these , brilliant , astounding , stupendous and awesome . this is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time . the first track is good and then it just gets better and better . in fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track . the book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing , but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing . minphaser , life line , guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds , bets and samples . the keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music
1	ahh this is a great cd . i listen to it every day . it 's fun music , and the lyrics are wonderful . hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do
1	`` debut '' is used to describe someone 's first release . not their third . a classic , 5 stars ... pmg in an exciting , formative mode
0	i am a huge atl fan . black mafia 4 life , know what i mean . i waited a long time for this release , and it was painful to listen to . it just seemed to lack direction . it might be said that this album ( an independent record label ) was so bad , that it ended their careers . too bad , i loved atl .
1	nothing at all like boy-band cds ( insync , backstreet boys , etc like editorial compared it to ) . while some of the songs are over-processed and do n't allow clay 's strong , clear , and beautiful voice to shine through enough , it is overall a very good cd . it has some catchy tunes on it . his second cd , merry christmas with love , allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more
0	i was very disappointed that the version of `` paper roses '' included on this cd is an updated and new recorded version from 1990 . it is not the original 1973 classic marie recorded when she was twelve.interestingly , this new version is produced by sonny james , the original producer of the original single , that also features many of the original studio musicians . so all is not lost . still , i prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this cd included an updated `` paper roses .
0	if this had been the first album in the `` hip-hop hits '' series , it would not be a promising start . there are a few decent tunes on here , but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier source albums , i must express an intense dislike for `` hip hop hits vol.8 '' . there used to be a time when the source gathered the biggest and best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations , now benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites ( how else do you explain ja rule being here ? ) . here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster : ( 1 ) youngbloodz feat . lil jon `` damn '' c- . this song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with `` sothern crunk '' . it 's lame and boring , as it shows lil jon becoming a one-trick pony . not a good song to open an album with . ( 2 ) wyclef `` the industry '' b. wyclef is very talented , but this song was never a hit . it should be heard for its quality though , even if it only touchs topics breifly . it is clear that wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway ; sorta like 2pac . ( 3 ) chingy `` right thurr '' b+ . not my favorite rap song , its better than average though , it kinda grows on you . he reminds me of juvenile . it 's content is not original , but chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style . ( 4 ) young gunz `` ca n't stop , wo n't stop '' c. if this standard work is what roca-a-fella has in it 's post-jay-z future , the label is going to be in real trouble . they 're good , but they have to be better than good to stand on their own . ( 5 ) westside connection feat . nate dogg `` gangsta nation '' b+ . it was nice to see westside together again . the style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material . at the bare minimum , the song is stylistic and very enjoyable . ( 6 ) ja-rule `` clap back '' d. this anti-eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame . any eminem song is a bigger hit and better than ja rule 's weak new stuff . if ja rule wants to return to his position `` pain is love '' brought him to , he must work much harder . ( 7 ) kanye west `` through the wire '' c. kanye west has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype , but i find this song to be very pedestrian for rap . the lyrics do n't define kanye as an original rapper , and the use chaka kahn 's `` through the fire '' does n't make a very appealing beat . ( 8 ) gang starr `` skills '' c. the group is n't that good to begin with , and this song has none of the fun that `` militia '' had . gang starr has a decent , hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves . ( 9 ) j-kwon `` tipsy '' b-.this song is fun to listen to , but that still does not make it any better than average . it 's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end ; you may be looking at your watch . he 's too overpraised . ( 10 ) e-40 feat . clipse `` quarterbackin '' c+ . the track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable . e-40 and clipse just are n't that talented . it almost feels as if it was made strictly for the `` madden football '' video games '' . ( 11 ) fabolous feat . tamia `` into you '' a . just great , hip hop with style and substance . it 's so nice to hear a gentler , more positive hip-hop songs ; one that does n't hammer the listener , but brings out emotions lightly . he is one of the best rappers of 2003 ; with both his album and it 's singles . ( 12 ) t.i . `` be easy '' c- . he has been compared to jay-z and nelly ; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have . plain , boring , generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game ; no more needs to be said . one must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger ( not exactly better though ) hits `` rubber band man '' and `` let 's get away '' . ( 13 ) cassidy feat . r. kelly `` hotel '' b- . a sorta fun track , r. kelly does as much as possible , but he even he ca n't make cassidy sound original . to be honest , this was a huge top 10 hit though ; so it kinda does belong here . ( 14 ) ying yang twins feat . lil ' jon the east side boyz `` salt shaker '' b+ . surprisingly , the beat and production make this song rather entertaining . it 's much more fun than it has the right to be ; given the non-spectacular artists involved . ( 15 ) scarface `` recognize '' c- . scarface used to be an exceptional rapper , but now he 's trying to regain glory that is no longer his . why listen to this , when you could just buy his older albums ? ( 16 ) the untouchables featuring benzino `` relationship with me my gun '' c-.just a standard benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion . i would n't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to . atleast `` bang ta dis '' on `` vol.5 '' was a good song . bottom line : *1/2 . benzino has ruined the once great source series in the blink of an eye . if you want to hear a great source album , buy `` hip hop hits vol.4 '' ; a source album with the biggest and best raps of 2000 . a few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones . to put it in short terms : with so many good compilations out there , why spend money on a bad one ? i would not buy this album with a gift card .
1	as with all of zucchero 's cd 's , this is also wonderful . i listen to it all the time , it 's sensual and sexy and great
0	the versions of `` black sabbath '' and `` war pigs '' actually comprise half of black sabbath 's appearance on the april 26 , 1970 edition of john peel 's 'sunday show . ' `` black sabbath '' features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song . `` war pigs '' is actually `` walpurgis , '' an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics . incidentally , the other two songs from that broadcast , `` fairies wear boots '' and `` behind the wall of sleep , '' were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release . all four of these tracks , while fascinating , do n't rightfully belong on this collection , as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne 's career as a solo artist . for that reason , the live version of `` paranoid '' that appears on this set is equally unnecessary . those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album , particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy 's biggest hits and/or notable tracks such as `` flying high again , '' `` shot in the dark , '' `` i do n't know , '' `` breaking all the rules , '' or `` road to nowhere . '' to add to the confusion , some of the solo-era material included here is n't exactly what it purports to be . ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties . these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with , in some cases , re-recorded tracks . the 'blizzard of ozz ' and 'diary of a madman ' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts , presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke ( drums ) and bob daisley ( bass ) , who , incidentally , wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from 'blizzard of ozz ' through 'no more tears . ' the 'bark at the moon ' album , while not re-recorded , was most certainly remixed . it is the re-recorded versions of the 'blizzard of ozz ' and 'diary of a madman ' tracks and the remixed version of the 'bark at the moon ' track that appear on the current edition of this collection . finally , the version of `` no more tears '' is actually the video edit , not the album version . in addition , due to one of the disputes mentioned above , 'the ultimate sin ' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy 's catalog . that album 's biggest hit , `` shot in the dark , '' which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection , has now been replaced with `` miracle man '' from 'no rest for the wicked . ' along these lines , the 'just say ozzy ' live ep and the double-disc live album , 'live and loud , ' both of which contain a live version of `` shot in the dark , '' have also been deleted from ozzy 's catalog . not even 'the essential ozzy osbourne , ' a double-disc collection covering ozzy 's entire solo career , features a single song from 'the ultimate sin . ' the ultimate sin , indeed . my recommendation is to avoid this collection ( and the 2002 remasters ) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or , better yet , search for the original albums on vinyl
1	i was already a fan of mike and the jacksons , but when motown 25 came on in 83 , this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go . till this day in my lifetime that one performance at motown 25 is the single most perfect performance i 've ever seen . i remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other . the saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves . hilarious . as an adult , i refuse to let the media and even michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music . 24 years later thriller remains the album to beat
0	i just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song . thanks to melania for pointing out the song title at the end . i realize this cd is just a soundtrack , but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs . it is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this cd . my vote - do not buy this cd . the soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff . but get the ending title song if you can - it 's great .
0	fight club is without a doubt the greatest film i 've ever seen . yeah , i 'm a fanboy . and what ? and to make a great film flow , you need great music , right ? well , you need great music that fits the film , and the dust brother 's score more than does the trick . the film is dark yet satirical , and it needed a score that would compliment that . however , the score simply does n't stand up on its own . at times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere , but its only a part of a tense scene . and hence , it sounds rather empty by itself . no matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it ( as i did ) , i would n't recommend it . like so many other scores , it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film
1	this cd is so awesome , it stays in my cd player and i have recently added it to my mp3 .
0	now on their sixth studio album ( and second on a major label ) carbon leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of `` love , loss , hope , repeat . '' lead vocalist barry privett has a warm , pleasant way of delivering his lyrics , and renowned producer peter collins fulfills his duties . nevertheless , the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety . in fact , it is so subtle that not one song is memorable . some lyrics are heartfelt ( `` the war was in color '' recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson , lead single `` learn to fly '' regretfully summons up inner strength ) but with such flat , by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on . everything sounds just fine , but nothing is endearing . every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance , and privett , despite his appealing voice , could easily be singing one extremely long song . this project is obviously well-intentioned , but many other bands have done this before and better . these guys without a doubt have talent , but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason . next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record .
0	as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering . let me first say that i am a fan of this group , which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom , but what i heard was bluegrass muzak . yes , the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence , and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller , but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing . gospel music , even bluegrass gospel , has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves . a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous , some serious and contemplative , some that push the envelope of orthodoxy , and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners . this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards . my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new , or buy used . want mine
0	this cd isnt real good if you like compilations than get the ruff ryders c
1	eloy ( name taken from h g well`s time machine ) is a german atmospheric , progressive art rock band that was formed back in 1969 . through the years , personal wise , the band has totally turned over , in some positions , several times . their originator frank bornemann ( guitars/vocals ) has persevered , presiding over a three decade band , that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music , i 've had the fortune to hear . ocean ocean , their sixth album , released in 1977 , is a concept album , depicting the rise and fall of atlantis . though there are only four tracks , they average almost eleven minutes each . many eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force ' . it is excellent , but as far as i 'm concerned , based on what i 've heard so far , there is no album that stands heads above the others . overall , ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of hawkwind or a more unknown band that i once reviewed named ship of fools . it also reminds me jeff wayne 's , war of the worlds . track listing 1 . poseidon 's creation ( 11:38 ) **** has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro . at the 4:40 mark , bornemann finally begins the vocal . there is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song , augmented occasionally by the synth . 2 . incarnation of the logos ( 8:25 ) **** has an atmospheric vocal beginning . the song does n't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant one , assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then . 3 . decay of the logos ( 8:15 ) ***½ the shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music . when it does get going after about three minutes it 's still jerky in a medium paced beat . strong synth playing through the middle . 4 . atlantis ' agony at june 5th - 8498 , 13 p.m. gregorian earthtime ( 15:35 ) ***** this is a monster song . it is like nothing i 've ever heard . except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning , `` atlantis ... '' starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro . not just any intro , like you 're used to , with a full orchestra and violins . no this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great pink floyd , envious , with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge , with no beat just the hammond a few side effects and you . no it does n't get boring . instead it sets you up for the vocals , which issue forth at about the eight minute mark . slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat , while the singer does a great imitation of bob dylan , with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal . but we 're not done . with about two minutes left , the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo ( the first time i`ve heard them play at this speed ) . now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale . total time : 43:53 line-up - frank bornemann / guitars , vocals - klaus-peter matziol / basses , vocals - jürgen rosenthal / drums , percussion , flute - detlev schmidtchen / keyboards , mellotron , xylophone , voice - the boys of santiago / chorus ( 1 ) conclusion one of the factors , i find appealing about this band , is that in the span of three decades , they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era , so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods . eloy 's musical tempo almost never exceeds medium and on ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range . listening to this and other eloy albums i hear influences from numerous other bands . like many prog bands i hear pink floyd but i also hear uriah heep , moody blues and bob dylan ( really , on track four ! )
1	a quality album from richard . long time fans will not be disappointed . it will win over quite a few new fans as well with it great guitars and snappy lyrics
0	while some would call orange and acme `` studio '' albums , suggesting that they lack originality , but they have rythm . i would call myself a big jsbx fan , i play orange and acme constantly , however i feel that this album is a little too much free form , and free noise for the everyday listener . i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx , because it is a rather acquired taste
0	from the twang of his guitar to the cowboy hat perched on his head , george strait is totally and completely revolting . i mean , for goodness sake the man 's like 100 years old ! how much longer is it going to take for everyone to realize that ? if you like this kind of music , please go to charter before you 're beyond help . take this as a warning-do n't buy the cd
0	mercifully , vh-1 has n't released the nauseating , moron-targeting 'i love the 90s ' dvd series ( yet ) , so you 'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc . this is precisely the kind of cd which should n't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet , legal or illegal . there 's no rhyme or reason to the collection , and the songs you might actually want to remember ... you probably already downloaded them . the source show is easily one of the most appalling projects mtv/vh-1 has produced in some time . it 's basically a bunch of 'comedians ' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s ( or rather , the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996 , say ) with such fond memories and gusto , hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that mambo no . 5 was a 'good , memorable song ' for instance . avoid at all costs . take pleasure in denying tag team their royalties when you find their 'classic ' song on online ... for free
1	this is a great movie soundtrack ! . i 'm a passport fan since i was a kid back in the 70 's . i have all klaus doldinger 's official releases with his passport signature . please go and look for this cd `` running in real time '' from passport and listen to track number 2 : auryn . then go and get all his passport releases ( almost 20 cds since the 70 's ) . then you will see why klaus doldinger is very creative
1	i love to working with this soundtrack in the back ground . the music is fun , whimsical , and out of the ordinary . i like pop and rock , but sometimes you just need good music without the lame lyrics
0	i like machine head a lot . many people disliked `` the burning red '' and called them sell-outs , but i appreciated the effort to make something different . then came `` supercharger '' . i have listened to it a dozen times , looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it . it never came . this is a bad cd by a great band .
1	i bought this cd after i 'd watched the movie the first three times . the music is wonderful . i bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - `` i do n't care to stay here long '' and i want it played at my own funeral way out there in `` someday '' . you ca n't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the cd than in the movie . but just in case , here 's the first foot-stompin ' verse : fare -- well , vain world ! i 'm going home . my savior smiles and bids me come and i do n't care to stay here long . bright angels beckon me away to sing god 's praise in endless day and i do n't care to stay here long . right up yonder ! christians , away up yon-der . oh , yes my lord , for i do n't care to stay here long
1	my personal favorite dashboard cd . every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that i like , but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis
1	while photek was ( and still is ) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound , his approach changes significantly on `` solaris . '' starting off with the first three tracks , his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work ( especially on `` modus operandi '' ) , but sound more full , more resonant . the tracks where he wanders into the realm of house were quite repeditive , and despite robert owen 's wonderful efforts ( first time i 've heard him ) , they were lacking . the best track on the album , and one of the best photek works is definitely `` infinity . '' the rumbling bass really cuts right to the core , and reminds me a little of source direct . the trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music , but the more ethereal `` halogen '' left an impression . a wash of sound that previously parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll , it comes off much better for the lack of any true form . not a great album , but solid and indicative of where photek would like to go in terms of his future works
1	this is one of the ultimate collection 's of pure music at its finest ... .1 problem thou ... on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names ... kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection : (
1	hey ! ... .it 's johnny cash ! you ca n't go wrong purchasing anything by johnny cash .
0	i purchased this album because i am a fan of the last poets . upon listening to the samples provided by amazon.com , i thought i was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the last poets : some great politically charged poetry , perhaps accompanied by some funky beats . however , when i listened to the whole cd , i was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like `` get out of the ghetto blues . '' if more of the tracks had the sound of the title track , this would be a five-star album , in my opinion . true , scott-heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album , but not in the form i had hoped for . i would take the last poets ' album `` this is madness '' over this particular scott-heron album
0	amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms ' music . with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius ' . the choice of music is also quite perfunctory . there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose . buy at your own risk . my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd..
1	engelbert humperdinck `s name has remained for almost five decades in the great musical stages . in spain there is a term that fits so well to describe his magnetism : duende . he shone with radiant intensity in the age of the great crooners , the most difficult , indeed : frankie , tony bennet , andy williams , dean martin , matt monroe , bobby vinton , booby goldsboro , glenn campbell , o.c . smith , otis reading , pat boone , kenny rogers , paul anka and neil diamond ( from time to time ) among the most remarkable ones . his peculiar style has deserved him the best acknowledgments all over the world . his multifacetic repertoire and elegant voice confers him presence and conviction every time he appears on stage . his name is now a legend . go for this admirable collection , you will enjoy it over and over
1	if you like vocalese , then this cd is for you . the song selection and performances are excellent . in my opinion , it stands up with the best lambert , hendricks , and ross stuff . it is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the making of this record . buy and enjoy
0	this is simply a transfer of the lp master done when cds were just getting started . the quality is inferior to other collections and the selection is weaker . go for the collectables twofer instead . much better sound and more cuts
1	more like 3.5 . so . half of this album is excellent . the rest is filler . but , due to `` times like these '' , `` all my life '' , disenchanted lullaby ( the intro irritates me but it gets better ) , `` have it all '' ( kinda sappy but i love the intro ) , `` low '' ( have you seen the video ? ) and `` overdrive '' ( again , kinda sappy but there 's something about it i love ) , the album is pretty enjoyable . it does n't compare to the first three , but it has its moments . the riffs are slightly heavier , most songs are pretty upbeat . `` times like these '' is an instant classic with awesome lyrics , while `` all my life '' rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs . kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles , but if they had released other songs , no-one would buy the album . mind you , my friend loves `` burn away '' , so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
0	i bought guerolito after hearing `` heaven hammer , '' the remixed version of guero 's `` missing . '' that remix , by air , is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of `` missing '' and makes it feel at home in a louder , more tempting sonic landscape . that song became astonishing where the guero song was simply alright , and the new song , `` clap hands , '' is at least a good time . however , it 's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of guerolito - the beat and the original of , say , `` earthquake weather , '' ( here as `` terromoto tempo '' ) are both individually appealing enough , but together sound dismayingly like they 're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other . `` e-pro '' becomes a groaning mess , the lovely `` farewell ride '' an electronic nightmare , and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole
0	this air supply should 've been cut off a very long time ago . whenever any of their songs comes on the radio i immediately shut it off . bad ear candy is all they ever recorded . mindless , sappy garbage . even bread 's music was more interesting than this
0	i was disappointed when i received this cd . although it is original , the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two . by your side , ( my favorite ) is good for about two minutes . then the beat gets off track , and starts to sound terrible . if this was done on purpose , i can not fathom why . i know this is `` lo-fi '' , but a hint of bass would n't hurt at all . as it stands , the cd sounds like an unfinished product , and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own . i think this cd would best be used for some sampling ... especially in today 's hip-hop . if you are looking for beautiful , relaxing music ... look elsewhere
1	michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana . this record is her first with friend jessica harp . the ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format . highlights include the opening track leave the pieces , way back home , the good kind , and the title track stand still look pretty . of special note is the presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks . i recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't sound like formula country
1	this is a must have for anyone with an r `` oldies '' collection . you wo n't be disappointed
1	i am a latecomer to the works of chopin , unqualified to comment on dinu lipatti 's technique and interpretation , but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes . they are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication , but on this disc lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising . there are four waltzes in the key of a flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital . contrast this to alexandre thaurad 's cd where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups . ( he also adds five more posthumous works . ) most of chopin 's waltzes start on the dominant , meaning either the fifth note of the home key ( the tonic , the i ) , or a dominant seventh chord ( v7 ) which leads to the tonic . lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle . if , for instance , there were a waltz that ended on a c natural it could easily bring us to waltz no 4 , which starts on an insistent c7 chord before rising to the home key of f major . i will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this cd . track 1 : waltz no 4 in f , `` grande valse brillante '' - as noted starts on the v7 and finishes on f in octaves . track 2 : no 5 in a flat - begins on a trilling dominant eb , but the note it trills up to is an f ( which ended the previous track ) . finishes with a parting shot , a turn in the bass ending on ab . track 3 : no 6 in d flat , `` minute waltz '' - starts on ab ; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well . ends in db . track 4 : no 9 in a flat - has two pick up notes then hits a db on the downbeat of the first measure . the right hand ends on the ab above middle c. track 5 : no 7 in c sharp minor - starts on a g sharp above middle c , which is the same black key ( enharmonic equivalent ) of the previous ab . ends in c # minor . track 6 : no 11 in g flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a db ( enharmonic c # ) . ends on a gb in the treble clef . track 7 : no 10 in b minor - starts quietly on the same note , an f # ( enharmonic gb ) . ends with a soft b in the bass clef . track 8 : no 14 in e minor - first note is the exact same b in the bass . ends in e minor . track 9 : no 3 in a minor - starts on an e in the bass melody . ends in a minor ; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a c natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure . track 10 : no 8 in a flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys , but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz . instead of starting on the dominant , this one begins on the major third -- c natural . track 11 : no 12 in f minor - starts on the dominant -- c again . toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch . instead of ending in f minor this waltz closes in the relative major of ab . the last three notes are a rise and fall , bb-c-ab . track 12 : no 13 in d flat - there is a leading note before the dominant . the first three notes ( bb-ab-f ) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous . ends quietly in db . track 13 : no 1 in e flat , `` valse brillante '' - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection . if you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note , a bb -- quietly in the former , boldly here . finishes resoundingly in the tonic eb . track 14 : no 2 in a flat , `` grande valse brillante '' - introduction in the dominant chord , eb7 . closes in ab . from here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again , linking the major third ( c natural ) to the v7 that starts the f major waltz
1	honestly , led zeppelin is the only artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not one bad song . when you listen to one of their albums in your car , there 's no , `` oh , i really like track 2 , but i do n't like the next couple , so i 'll skip to track 5 after that one 's over . '' now it is common opinion that the classic albums of led zeppelin are the first five , and `` houses of the holy '' is the fifth one . this is zeppelin at their pinnacle , which in my opinion , they never fall from . `` the song remains the same '' is pagey at his best with his gibson double-neck . the song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy , but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune . page 's initial ( and incredible ) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album . `` the rain song '' is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood . the lyrics are deep , and while the song to me is melancholy , it is also refreshing . `` over the hills and far away '' is a 5-trillion star song , with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics . `` the crunge '' is groovy and funny . the bass is really felt in this song , and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh . `` dancing days '' is very far out , but a summer-y song with an addictive riff . `` d'yer mak'er '' is one to definitely highlight bonzo 's masterful rhythm skills , or in other words , great drums ! equal to that is pagey on guitar and robert 's singing , `` i still love you so ... but i ca n't let you go ... '' `` no quarter '' is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to john paul for an exquisite keyboard solo . `` the ocean '' is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff . an overall energizing song . this is the best deal for this album -- do not pass it up ! i hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection ... not one bad song
1	i owned the album as a kid ... ... .i enjoy it as much now as i did then
1	i am 62 years old , and seen them all . i have never seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as beth hart at the paradiso ! simply the most powerful stage performance i have ever witnessed ! she takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment , and just plain never coasts through a song . some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing , and most were mesmerized by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics ! she has been compared to janis . i saw janis twice , and beth hart would bury janis in any category ! i ca n't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the paradiso for very long -- it just does n't seem humanly possible ! i am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever . magnificent in its fury !
1	trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this cd at home . bajo fondo tango club is not as pure tango as piazzola 's nor as chill out percolated as gotan project 's , which makes them a band for all publics . nor even one single person in my office could n't help download at least one song of this cd into their ipods . three of them already bought their copy
0	when it comes to big star 's 70 's output , you can call me a hopeless fanboy , because after listening to in space , it seems that only a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later , exactly one-half of the classic big star lineup could -- -or in forever difficult alex chilton 's case , would be so inclined -- -to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great . this disc has way more in common with chilton 's oft-times difficult , mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of big star 's previous fascinating pop near-perfection . while i 'll admit that i have enjoyed a good chunk of chilton 's solo work , ( in a slightly guilty , rolling-my-eyes , `` oh ... that alex ! '' sorta way ... ) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that this group and that this particular collection of songs are presented as `` big star . '' in space is connected musically to the original big star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in this band were in that band . if you do n't expect much , you wo n't be disappointed .
1	this was the break through record for pink floyd that would place them in the super-league . the strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and dave gilmore 's guitar playing and voice is superb . production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential . overall the record works well as a whole yet i do feel 'money ' seems out of place . the problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption . now do n't get me wrong i think this is a magnificent record but is it really pink floyd 's greatest album , i tend to think not . is it the greatest record of all time ? most certainly not . because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great . because everybody and their grandmother thinks it 's great , does not necessarily make it great . the problem with this record is that it sounds of its time , not that that 's a bad thing , its just that it does not transcend time . the real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it . i ca n't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive . some records released at the same time : can 's `` future days '' ( 1973 ) ; nue ! 's `` 2 '' ( 1973 ) ; king crimson 's `` larks ' tongues in aspic '' ( 1973 ) ; robert wyatt 's `` rock bottom '' ( 1974 ) ; tangerine dream 's `` phaedra '' ( 1974 ) are by far more influential and enduring than dark side . if you do n't own dark side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars , but make sure you buy 'piper at the gates of dawn ' also . 'piper ' is floyds greatest , most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time . besides , how many people who think 'dark side ' is floyd 's best have actually heard 'piper ' .
1	this album has new meaning to me now in 2007 , where i go to a college next to a high school , where i see a bunch of `` punk rockers '' spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness . there are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of social distortion alive , but sometimes their music is hard to find , and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire . albums like this exist for times like those . just stick it in , turn up the volume , and rock out
1	i love it so . i bought it after seeing the video for `` make you feel that way '' and i have n't been disappointed . love the vibe of the cd ... it just flows and the mix is well done , as you go from a `` head-nodder '' to a smooth groove so seamlessly . i just put it in and let it play ! my absolute favorite jam is `` nowhere fast , '' which comments on what we were , what we are and what we hope to be `` tomorrow . '' i love this cd so much , i went and bought their other two full play cd 's . i make my girls sick with how much i play this cd . i guess i 'll eventually take it out the rotation , maybe `` tomorrow ! '' a must for anyone who loves great hip hop
0	i was hoping to hear the rockin ' spanish flavor of the robert rodriguez band chingon , but what the hell is this ? ! ! ! the amazon recomendations lead me to this album , and hinde sight i should have read a little more before buying , but i was too excited to hear more of the rodriguez chingon . i hope this helps you
0	i agree complete with erik cobbett . this is covenant 's most unnecessary and boring album ever . there are a couple of nice parts on it , but generally it 's a big disappointment .
0	i was unable to play in my car cd player , so only choice i got is to listen at home using my home dvd player .
1	i assume you already know what 's on this recording or you would n't be here , right ? do n't you probably have a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you have n't listened to for years because it 's dusty and has scratches and pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway ? well , i wo n't review the music here because others have done better than i would , but i will say that listening to this remaster through a high quality set of headphones ( sennheiser ) has enabled me to hear this as if it were the first time . it 's totally worth the money to get this new version , and the bonus tracks just make it even more fun .
0	i love this show ! that said , i do not care for this version of it . the inclusion of the word `` concept '' in the title means it is just that . this was , thankfully , not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song , `` one night in bangkok '' . with most broadway musicals , the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show . if you listen to the recordings of phantom , mama mia , beauty and the beast , you can discern the basic storyline of the show . listening to this particular recording of chess , though , will leave you wondering `` what was that ? '' the broadway arrival of chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers . this recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that do n't really relate to each other . for musical fanatics ( like myself ) , i say `` yes , you should have this recording in your collection '' , if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on broadway . if you are only buying the album because of `` one night in bangkok '' , purchase the broadway recording instead ; you 'll be much happier with the performance by phillip casnoff rather than murray head
0	i wo n't dispute emmylou 's wonderful voice and mark knopfler 's superb guitar playing but this album just did n't cut it for me . pretty lame , about as likely as hank and phoebe snow
0	i luv fall out boy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awl songs get 10 outta 10 ! ! ! ! ! ! deservs all 6 starss ! ! !
0	... and im happy about it ! i think i might cry if'n it shows up again . fareals . if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c-side ! i love me some roy , but bruh hurt me with this one . i forgive him tho , cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now ... ... um , hope that came out right . *pimp struts off stage/pounds chest with gorilla fist/machismo free flowing* m'out yall , peace !
0	i am a huge fan of btnh , but even i will admitt this is not a good album . the worst being `` home '' which uses samples from phil collins . the whole thing feels kind of empty , with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works . there are a few songs worth listening to . most notably is `` clevland is the city '' which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any `` harmony '' to it . other songs worth mentioning are `` what about us '' , `` not my baby '' and `` pump , pump '' , the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage . it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released
1	if you do not yet own dark side of the moon , wish you were here and the wall , do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason . amlor is junk by comparison . that said , very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three , and amlor certainly has its bright spots . `` learning to fly '' and `` on the turning away '' are as good as anything pink floyd has ever produced . some of the other songs are adequate , but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier floyd releases . it 's definitely worth having , but make sure that you have the others first .
0	i have all her other cds i especially love unsung heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good ... .sure the technique is spot on but there is no soul the emotion is missing ... for me i like my jazz vocals with feeling . i like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song . u wont get that here all u will get is technique..
0	man i do n't know what he was thinking when he recorded some of these songs . the musicianship is , of course , outstanding and his voice is perfect for covering lightning hopkins , furry lewis , son house ( shaker lp ) but who wants to hear repeated renditions of my old dog blue ? i agree with other reviewers who laud `` james alley blues '' `` richland woman '' the 2 l.hopkins songs `` katie mae '' and `` darling , do you remember me '' muddy waters ' `` little geneva '' and sonny boy williamson 's `` do n't start me to talking . '' the other songs do not merit a second listening for anything other than historical interest . the `` shaker '' cd is even worse . son house 's `` death letter '' is above average , maybe even great . the rest is barely listenable . if you love the blues , particularly folk blues you will be infinitely happier with any l. hopkins cd
0	something that someone who claims to be country should not do . even though these girls are already pop , remixing it to make it even more pop was a huge mistake ! then again , they have to do something to sell more cd 's ! lol ! !
1	rem has had a helluva lot of hits , and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands . this 18-track album does a good job for its length , but i really do feel a 2-cd hit package is warranted . the biggest omissions are `` shiny happy people , '' `` it 's the end of the world as we know it , '' and `` this one goes out to the one i love . '' it would n't surprise me if the band did n't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection . however , there are a few other more minor hits i know from them that are missing , like `` radio free europe . '' i just ca n't think of other titles right now , but there are more than a few other omissions too . many of the minor hits that are included here , thankfully , are very good and will grow well on you : `` the great beyond , '' `` bad day , '' `` all the way to reno , '' `` e-bow the letter , '' and `` imitation of life '' are songs i have n't heard enough of and i 'm glad they are on this collection . still , i hear rem is coming out with another compilation and i imagine it will be more complete ; i suggest waiting for that album when it comes out
1	the previous review has a few inaccuracies i thought i 'd correct . first off , the beats on all of atmosphere 's albums , including this one , are produced and created by ant , not dj abilities . ant does not perform live , and so slug often used to perform with dj abilities ( and others ) . this may change in the next album as atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour , but it 's extermely likely ant will be included in the production . slug has never been 1/3 of atmosphere , he has and always will be the main driving force and only consistent member of the group . even when spawn was a member of atmosphere , slug was still clearly the leader and brains beyond the operation , as evidenced by the tracks on overcast ! , all of which were dominated by slug . yes , this album is quite different from the newer stuff , and represents a critical moment in atmosphere 's evolution . of course , anyone can listen to it . even those silly `` fan boys . '' it 's a ridiculous notion to suggest that because something has changed , people wo n't like earlier incantations of the same group . it 's that elitist old school b.s . and it 's annoying . some may not like it , but most hip-hop fans will probably enjoy it . what makes this album so interesting is how raw it is , and , as slug says in the liner notes , how it 's representative of his transformation as an mc . recorded between overcast ! and lucy ford , you can witness slug move from being a whitty , well-versed thug to something deeper and more innovative . both elements are present . `` the abusing of the rib '' is one of the more evolved tracks on the album , while `` @ it again '' is about sleeping with all sorts of girls in the twin cities , including yours of course . note that i say `` evolved '' not in the sense that one song is better than another , but rather more representative of slug 's later work ( lucy ford ) . this album represents a critical moment in the history of what i believe is the best hip hop group ( individual ) out there . while it does n't have the catchiest melodies ( the beats are great , just not catchy ) , it has some amazing rhymes and showcases slug 's ability to flow quickly and rap prolifically . check it out
0	there are 2 really good songs on here . the first is `` untitled , '' which sounds like gibbard was listening to a lot of brian wilson at the time he wrote it . the percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds . `` underwater '' is a pretty good song ... but the real jewel on the album is `` send packing . '' it really is a beautiful , well-written song . the rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments . basically , the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly . all in all , i would n't spend 10 bucks on it , but a couple tracks are pretty good
1	very different , very cool ! an awesome cd that all ages in my house ( from 13 to 68 ) really enjoy listening to
0	well , i like the song `` i shall believe '' and that 's why i purchased this album , but it would have been better to buy just the single
0	how can anyone say this chick has talent ? ! ! ! my god , she is sooooooooo bad . and yes , i actually listened to it . the only reason it sounds semi ok is because she 's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good ! she does n't write any of her songs and she ca n't hold a tune . gives celine a run for her money ? please ! ! ! ! the only singer she sounds better than is paris hilton ! but whatever . if you like it , that 's all that matters . if you like pretty young pop stars , christina aguilera is much better . she can actually sing ! !
1	`` i have been a brickman fan since the very first album . much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much `` electronic enhancement . '' escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums . there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano . if you are a brickman fan , this is a must have album .
0	just listening to the samples of this new remix of `` gold:35th anniversary edition ~ the carpenters '' i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly . certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well . i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs ? as another review noticed and i agree with , is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice . this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters . the older cds ( if still in production or if you can find them used ) `` carpenters classics 25th anniversary '' a 2 cd disc 98:04 minute collection remastered digitally , is a much better pick . especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with . the other cd 's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen 's deep resounding perfect voice , would be the cd `` voice of the heart '' this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song . the other one i would highly recommend , if christmas is your holiday , would be `` carpenters christmas portrait '' ... `` special edition digital version ... .celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the seasons best ... '' with karen and richard . there are 34 carpenters songs as timeless as their sound , and 11 performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time . these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing . these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard . this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter 's recorded and later remastered-not remixed- sounded . for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a 2 star rating . these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans , took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song . talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver . as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying `` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ! '' or in this case do n't remix it !
1	stephen stills `` for what it 's worth '' is , of course , a classic song . `` burned , '' neil young 's strongest effort for this album , is another classic song . the rest of it is all very good . i would say that it does sound a bit dated , however ; , and that this one is mostly for fanatics of 60 's music . your average `` artic monkeys '' fan is not going to find this a good match for their musical sensiblities . better was on the way from buffalo springfield . their next album , `` buffalo springfield again '' is an all out rock masterpiece that everybody should own , whatever your age or inclinations .
0	what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians . it sounds like espn called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later ... .presto ... instant mush
0	wow , did someone slip the wrong cd into my jewelbox or what ? if you 're a fan of allison 's other work , epect nothing like what you 've heard before . this is mostly a pop album , and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering . the sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding . even allisons voice has no drive to it . steve earl is no match on the guitar for joe mcmahan who played on the show cd/dvd .
0	every one is obbsessed with `` hips do n't lie '' . do n't they relize that the songs horrible . well , so is every other track on this album . save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent
0	this is not , i repeat not five stars ! in all honesty it 's more like 1.5 or 2 stars and i 'm a big fan of slug atmosphere.albums like overcast , godlovesugly , the felt project , and the dynospectrum album is much better than this.though the lyrics are thought provoking , but slug has been better , the production does n't hold up.it 's some of the weakest i 've heard from rhymesayers.there 's only a couple tracks that stand out , but i 'd have to say `` do n't ever f**king question that '' is the best.if you wan na hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album.slug spits classic verse after classic verse
1	i got what i wanted in the time frame promised ... the way it 's supposed to work
1	collin has done it again . i did n't think i 'd enjoy a cd as much as his `` the walls came down , '' but `` tracks '' is just great . every song is better than the last . you ca n't go wrong with collin raye and you ca n't find anyone with a better voice . buy this one
0	this is a cd of the history of the band . interesting but was not a music cd . was not worth the price
0	i got hooked on tiesto about 5 years ago . heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album . neverhteless , it was n't but it was still tiesto though right ? well ... the hits on this cd are about 5 years old . the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists . stick with `` tiesto : nyana '' ... 10130340345435 times better
0	metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever . most of their trite albums deserve no stars . their only good cds are either master of puppets , or black album . kill em all is such a bore ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! james hetfield , the lead singer just screams and ca n't sing at all ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! why ? ? ? ? why ca n't he sing more proper like lou greamm ( foreigner ) , mark knopfler ( dire straits ) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? each and every song on this album is bad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do n't listen to the people who rate metallica 's albums a five star . they are overrated ... .green day is better . get them , dire straits , and foreigner insted . ps . this album is worth a minus trillion .
1	digressing from their first 2 albums , transmutation ( 5 stars ) and sacrifist ( 5 stars ) , praxis unleashes metatron . trimmed down to a 3 piece with laswell , bucket and brain covering all bases , metatron lacks bootsy 's space bass , yamatsuka eye 's agonizing screams or john zorn 's out of tune saxamaphoning , but it still rocks . track 1 is a laid back acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful . the album lacks the speed of some of sacrifist 's songs but makes up in phat grooves . half of the collection cd ( again 5 stars ) is from this album , but with nothing from transmutation , hmmm . instead of going further ill ' say this ... . get this album at alll costs . burn copies for friends and spread the gospel according to praxis
0	this disk is truly as bad as nitin 's previous disks were wonderful . take any previous nitin disk , throw in some alpha , a bit of craig armstrong , some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe , mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy . as with most prophesies there no good news about it . my prophesy is that anyone who buys this wo n't ever buy another nitin dis
0	this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums . he is the king of electric-blues . you can hear all these songs in great format . just awsome playing awsome singing . its sure no wonder srv . and hendrix really loved albert king
1	this mix starts off heavy , and never lets up , with the quirky , yet hard hitting vocal track grace ( anxiety ) by troy pierce ( as louderbach ) starting things off in a very energetic way . this track worked well in sascha funke 's boogy bytes 2 mix , but it was deep into the mix . i feel it 's even more effective starting a mix off . things quickly lighten up with the bloopy claude vonstroke next , and then it 's into the m.a.n.d.y . remix of tiefschwarz 's excellent track damage , featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals . two solid tech house tracks follow , especially touane 's snappy track bassic , and it 's right into the gritty , churning , techno sound of thomas schumacher 's incredible track rotor . the mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7 , which i feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix . it 's not bad , it 's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking . it 's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row , and right after the melodic freefall , it 's into tiefschwarz 's own remix of a depeche mode track . this is the only other slight miss in the mix for me , as i feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes , and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix . another solid melodic track is next , and we end with the dubbed out vocals of kate wax . overall , it 's an exciting tech house mix that 's a full lineup of solid tracks , with not a bad one in sight , and very few dips in the scorching pace of one , very sound , top to bottom mix . do not miss picking this one up , as it 's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year
1	love.this.album . every song is awesome ! this is the kind of album you play over and over because you feel great after listening to it . my favorites are `` in a moment '' and `` know '' . half past forever rocks !
1	i 've been a jim brickman fan for a few years now . when i saw this cd came out , i could not resist getting it . it is absolutely amazing and fully worth it . when i first put it in my stereo , i had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything . that was how impressive they were . the title of the album is incredibly fitting . while my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends , i have this cd turned up in my own little corner to `` escape '' from it all . i swear i could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit . if you love jim brickman , or just like soft jazz , or piano music , this cd is a must have
0	i bought this cd not long after it came out . it did n't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it ! ! ! i like somehow our love survives and abandoned garden . other than that this is a mediocre effort for michael . he has used this kind of brazilian theme on sleeping gypsy already . stick with your roots michael ... you are from california ... not south america . try buying blue pacific instead ! ! ! i abandoned this one a long time ago
0	this cd should have been called `` the most annoyingly overplayed songs of the 1990 's . '' with the exception of `` shine , '' every single track on this cd is juvenile , mindless , fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream ! if you 're looking for a cd that represents the greatest music of the 1990 's , check out non stop 90 's rock or forever 90 's instead . however , you might be interested in this cd if you want to host a cheesy 90 's dance party . the songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation
1	i recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like i was . listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh . life on planet groove will be a welcome addition to your collection . great for the drive
1	great compilation of songs from massive attack , all of their singles plus new never release songs . the videos are great and their new single 'live with me ' is a great song ( very sad video though ) . includes new version/remix of 'i want you ' with madonna . the combo is great you can own all of the videos , is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until 100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single , the changes in the way they used to make music videos . there 's even the first video with tricky ) . a must have for any massive attach fan , and if you never heard from this band , you get the best of the best with this cds/dvd . massive attack is a band that had influenced a lot of artist from bjork , tricky , madonna , morcheeba , portishead , unkle , etc .
0	... sorry , guys , i think that the cover says it all . totally out of focus and falling apart . i much prefer his later work
1	this is the latest entry in the lost legend series and it is the best alblum since the very first lost legends alblum release . the songs match up and compliment each other better than any of the previous alblums in this series , so well that it sounds like a dance alblum . i give it a high recommendation for any surf music fan . try alldirect.com for the best prices on this series of alblums
1	i am not sure about my baby , but i love this cd ! actually baby loves it too but probably not to that great extent . : -
1	i drive alot commuting to and from my job . this music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely indiana fall ! i 'm sure i 'll recall those colorful images as i continue to listen to this cd through the colorless days of winter
1	if this album did n't come out at its destinated time , 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music . outside of kurt carr 's cd , this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile . donald lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers . that 's basically what this finale does , it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene . we have new artists emerging in blanche ( mcalister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like madonna , cher , mandisa , ummmmm , think about it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) , dewayne woods ( thanks for the testimony and great sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up ) , the murrills , lajeune thompson ( sang girl ) , and sheri from the duo of ted sheri . there are so many hits on the whole cd from god is , god , you are an heir , giants , blessing from abraham , encourage yourself , of course all of the older stuff . one thing missing is kelly price should have guested on i walk with god or bring back stephanie mills .
0	if you are buying this because you love rob , be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat . if you are n't familiar with this incarnation ... let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame . same guy , different sensitivity . i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there . on this outing , rob has met the enemy and it is himself . he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it . this cd is not an acquired taste , it is a forced-feeding
0	this was not as good as i had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while i am working out but the rest is good .
0	after discovering and loving the sound of gotan project i was shopping around for groups with a similar sound . i stumbled along emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd , i thought i had found another gem . boy was i wrong . the first track drew me in and left me spellbound , unfortunately , it was all downhill after that . i was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on . the rest of the songs were so uninspiring , the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise
1	percy grainger was a man of spectacular gifts . he was one of the most original composer/arrangers in the early part of this century . he was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists . this amazing cd documents grainger 's formidible gifts . it can not be over-praised . both the music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover 's attention . do n't miss this one
1	attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now . i was n't that big of a fan until i saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot . i 'm running out of comedy albums , there 's not that many good ones out there . so i bought it and i was impressed . the audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show `` insomniac '' . they would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night . he has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them . you never see the punchline coming a mile away . he is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity , stay away . he is one of the few that i enjoy now , tragically mitch hedberg died in march because he was another . the increasingly popular dane cook does n't do it for me . cook 's retaliation cd has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album . i think cook is very marketable to the college , 20something crowd , guys like him because he 's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat , chicks think he 's cute . i recommomend attell myself , he is vulgar but is just a better comedian
0	hey , brrrrruuuuuccce ! what 's the deal ? just about every major top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated except yours . why can we buy the `` tracks '' editions , and get glorious hdcd-encoded sound , but `` town '' sounds like it 's coming out an am radio ? ok , you did your best , but dubya 's back in the white house for the next four years , and kerry 's home in his underwear watching the weather channel . you should have plenty of time on your hands now ... get busy ! let 's see some remastering !
0	... but this album should never have been released as the `` final '' queen-album . a couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many best of queen-releases . `` a winters ' tale '' for example . do i know much about the background for `` made in heaven '' , well perhaps not . but i know that this is known to be the last studio release . sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over , not that the melodies are bad , it just sounds ... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears ( at least ) this does n't sound like my queen . one of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with `` made in heaven '' ? was this really freddie mercurys ' wish ? it does n't make much sence after the fantastic `` innuendo '' released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad `` these are the days of our lives '' . the words and the music ... wow ! and the music video to this song , have you seen it ? to me that was the real good-bye with freddie , and with queen . and it has the sound of how i will remember them . but is `` made in heaven '' really that bad ? yes , and no . `` heaven for everyone '' by roger taylor made it sound promising , and do n't forget ; i was exited when i heard about `` a final material '' -release . but it turned out , as you might have guessed , far from what i had expected . old songs from b-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album ... i mean honestly ? `` too much love ... '' then quite a resent hit from brian mays ' solo-album `` back to the light '' , i remember thinking `` what 's the point ? '' and it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here . do n't get me wrong now , freddies ' vocal is as good as you 'd expect , it 's what they 've made out it that surprises me . and what makes me wish they had n't . at least not for an entire album . `` a winters ' tale '' is a positive surprise though . perhaps not freddies ' best song , and not better than `` these are the days ... '' . but it 's a celebration of the beauty in life . at least it sounds like that to me . freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace . and beauty . and it sounds like a classic queen-song ! `` a beautiful day ( intro and reprise ) '' functions well too . but what tracks 12 and 13 are about i have absolutely no idea.. ? i wish they would have ended the album with freddies ' last `` yeah ! '' on the song . i wish ... so all in all ; `` innuendo '' remains the explosive good-bye with the `` real '' queen . at least it does to me . ( let me add that the cover of `` made in heaven '' is perfect for the title , and somehow amazingly `` seals '' in its ' simplicity the fate of the band with freddie in the lead . the three band members left ( brian , roger , john ) facing the sunset , and a statue capturing freddie in a remembarable style on stage . reminding me of him at wembley 86 . to me this actually expresses something beyond words , and it 's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to `` heaven for everyone '' or `` a winters ' tale '' . )
0	there is now no trace of delight left in this band . all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent . i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe-eyed look saying their name , but this cd and the cd previous ( which did have 1 tune , `` apples , '' with which one could smile ) does , for the first time , take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes . first , we loose the roses , then the ned 's disband , following that , swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore . now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were .
1	i purchased this cd with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music . what i found , however , was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest . the ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded . each player displays exceptional technique , both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing . most impressive is listening to istomen who , playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part , voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings ; a feat very difficult to do as a pianist . this is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over
0	okay , i will admit to liking poor tom , bonzo 's whatever ( it sure beats moby dick ! ) and wearing and tearing , but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should 've stayed outtakes . low points include we 're gon na groove , the live i ca n't quit you baby , walter 's walk and ozone baby . it 's a shame that traveling riverside blues and hey hey , what can i do were left off this album , and included only in the boxed set reissue - it 's the only place you can find hey hey , what can i do , one of my favorite zeppelin songs , and with riverside blues , you have a choice : shell out $ 100 to get it , or sit through the crappy bbc sessions album . if you 're obsessed with the band , i guess this would be good for you . but the best version of coda is in the aforementioned $ 100 boxed set .
0	please change your name to ( kid rap ) .. when you start producing true rock cd 's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name ... stop playing both sides.. i realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about.. do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music . one day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..

0	i 'm sorry but the guy below me does n't know music if he was slapped with a gang starr cd . this mess is ridiculous . i would n't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car . they are the modern day version of young mc ... .here today gone tomorrow
0	this is not what i expected from such a gifted artist as jaheim , did he change producers ? the music and the man with the voice did n't go together well for me . this is one i will not be purchasing , it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums . better luck next time , jaheim i was truly disappointed .
0	i ca n't discard these songs completely , because they have such potential ! clever , fun lyrics , great beat , but boy i wish this guy could hit his notes more often ! i suppose this fellow requires the sort of `` pitch does n't matter '' mindset that grateful dead listeners perfected years ago ( or similar drugs ) . i 'm just not that tolerant or substance affected
0	me especially i can not hate on cam cuz i got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically . either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s*** to say . and judgin that his subject matter stays the same i guesss its true . dude spits some retarded a** lyrics . i give this cd a two cuz of the beats . but this dude is a certified beatwaster . these producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars . this n***a sumtimes do n't even rhyme
0	it would be impossible for me to write you a review . i never received the subject cd . you sent me some piece of crap dics which i sent back . i have not received the gene watson cd i ordered and paid for . if i do n't get it soon , you will never hear from me again . edward n clark - herrin , i
0	i bought this album after hearing america , their single off this album , and listening to the increasing hype about razorlight and johnny borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation . this follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first . it 's not bad , but it 's not that good either . the songs all sound like i 've heard them somewhere before , and the lyrics - well , how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone , nothing on the radio , and not known what it all meant , while smoking cigarettes late at night . yawn ...
0	this was just to much country for this parrothead . i liked one song , piece of work and that was about it
0	who in the world called this ''hard rock '' ? ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ? this is a bunch of self-pitying , mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all . i shall dub this as ''alternative whine '' .
0	at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr . i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd . at the time this album was realeased , hank jr. was riding high , winning big at the cma 's and acm 's . he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career . but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll . to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert . the only difference is he did n't botch the vocals as he does on his live show . the music is decidedly 80 % not country , it drifts towards eighties rock . if you trace hank jr. 's recording career , you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of . i must say though , this cd contains one of hanks last top 10 hits , `` if the south woulda won , '' which is an hard to find recording on his compilations . i 'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise , just because of that song .
0	i was never much of a chili peppers fan over the years , but i thought i 'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.and just as i always thought , it 's crap . very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have . i feel like i need a bath after just looking at their picture . as far as the `` music '' is concerned , the singing is awful ( deadpan monotone voice ) , the instrumentation is very limited , and the overall production is 2nd rate . the only plus , if any , is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material , which is still not very good . the fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have really bad taste .
0	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest . every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years , that is if it is n't allready . i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past , except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago . must have been on the album prior to this . but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one . not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart . horrible music with no feeling or soul , not even creative . do n't waste your time with this .
0	we read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper . we ( my husband , three kids 14 , 10 , and 5 ) tried it on a warm , spring evening in the car . one or two songs , like the banana splits , speed racer , and scooby-doo were fun . most however , were harsh , and too fast for the parents and youngest guy . i would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers
1	this is pure inspirational quintessential oteil and the peacemakers . it 's gospel , funk , jazz , rock ... features his distinctive scatting and amazing bass , a wonderful blend of talent ... glorious vocals ... you will not regret this purchase ... it 's a joy all the way through from beginning to end..
1	nwa was an original rap group and with that being said , this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers . along with public enemy , nwa christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats . although i do n't agree with some of their lyrics , one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life . anyways , buy this album , i recommend it . keep it away from the kiddies though
0	and he 's a super-talented drummer . the day the foos release a best-of compilation i 'll probably pick it up . otherwise , i 'm sad to say that the average foo fighters album cut just does n't cut it for me . all of the songs on there is nothing left to lose are mediocre , run-of-the mill `` alternative '' rock . only `` stacked actors '' has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite , but to be perfectly honest , it still is n't a huge turn-on in my book . `` learn to fly , '' the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio , may as well have been written by the outfield or some other average rock band along those lines . i almost gave this album two stars , but unfortunately i think that rating would be just too generous . foo fighters have made some really good songs , like `` everlong . '' but i honestly do n't think they 'd be nearly as big if grohl had n't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time , nirvana . elsewhere , their fantastic cover versions such as gary numan 's `` down in the park '' and prince 's `` darling nikki '' suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department
0	the dictators are incredible . few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n ' roll ideals as these guys have , and their spinal-tap-meets-ramones-mees-beach-boys style almost always works - almost . `` manifest destiny '' is a dissapointing release from the 'tators . i mean its not a bad album , but the guys can do much better than this . there are a few good songs . `` disease '' is hilarious , particulary the spoken word act from handsome dick at the begining . `` science gone too far '' is one of the band 's catchiest tunes , proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s . their closing cover of the stooges ' `` search destroy '' is an okay interperatation of the classic . however , that 's about it . the rest are mostly humorless fm-style rockers , and while the dictators were n't selling out , they were certainly trying to become more accesible . download those three tunes , and pick up every other album by the band
1	rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity . its not real hip hop . this album , brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop . honestly , the light is a song that never gets old , thats real . if you do n't have this album , get it .
0	when i played the first composition on this cd , i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping . but after that , this cd is disapointing to me . there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable . with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd , joyce cooling could have made one good cd . but , in my opinion , there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd . joyce certainly has potential , but she needs to work on her creativity . she sound here like an artist still maturing in style
0	greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , `` tha crossroads '' , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of `` f- tha police '' , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya
0	knuff respect to public enemy , they are one of the few groups in hip-hop history who 've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics . with that said , this single blows . it 's trash . the beats are trash , chuck d and flavor flav do n't rap , the dvd is just them hanging out in some clubs . it 's a shame , legends such as public enemy are far above this remedial single . if you want to hear their best worx , go and buy fear of a black planet , or it takes a nation of millions to hold us back . you wo n't be dissapointed..
1	review by mike watson : with the recent slew of victory records releases , not to mention the wide variety ; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases . however , picking through all of the less notable releases from the label , the up-and-coming band , the forecast , have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on late night conversations . the forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack , executed flawlessly over a ten song full length . late night conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing . the harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily . the forecast is not only a great recorded band , but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage , with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band . the forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music , and checking their victory records debut out is a must for fans of the genre .
0	it has been nearly three months and i have yet to receive the subject michael henderson cd . amazon should not be offering this item for sale , if they do not have access to a supplier
1	i really enjoyed the song kids in america by no secrets . both of my children enjoyed it as well . in fact i have been looking for their cd or for more information on them . i thought they were cute , fresh , and brought a new touch to the song
0	it seems that other than a song or two , fall out boy forgot their guitar 's . very disappointing and slow paced
0	i ca n't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album . the lyrics must have come out of a dadaist poetry circle , and ( most of ) the guitar work is completely without personality . what is the criterion of a good rock album ? by any standards it must be a joy to play it . 6teen stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional . but it does n't so much incite anger than it does disdain for bush 's attempts to emulate nirvana . where nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist , evocative lyrics , bush has dull , throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger . there 's not much more to say about 6teen stone . i could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like `` swim '' : thinning ice / 14 hairdryers / swimming to you / flame on earth desire . '' or the artistic suicide of the last track , `` x-girlfriend '' , a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that 's about six words long . that 's about all i can tell you . mostly i figure i 've done enough warning to let you make your own choice . if you do attempt this though , you ought to be told the little good news that there is : there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album , split between `` machinehead '' and `` glycerine . '' the first is an energetic , well-constructed song about control ( you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on total request live ) , the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars , a trembling cello , and a surprisingly coherent rossdale . they hold the album ; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building .
0	an absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians . i got ta say , i could have used a little more cowbell
1	i loved this album . strangely enough i was introduced to the title song by gray 's anatomy where i just had to find out who was singing that lead ( alice russell ) . the rest of the album is like the r b music i grew up with . definitely worth a listen
0	there 's nothing in this i 'd say even remotely resembles jazz . it 's repetitive , has a rock beat , and consists mostly of licks taken from other players . if you 're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room , this might be a good choice
1	this album was released in the summer of '86 when queen 's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the u.s. and at a very high point in europe.by now , the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock , yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.here we find the gorgeous ballad one year of love and the catchy friends will be friends.the ominous anthem who wants to live forever and the highlander themed princes of the universe are gems in this crown.the first two usa singles , the rocker one vision ( from iron eagle ) and the danceable a kind of magic barely cracked the us top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke
0	but for `` the drugs do n't work , '' which is marginal at best , this album is boring ... cookie-cutter , nothing original
0	i guess i was expecting more of a ferrante and teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but , if so , am missing depth ... great family but disappointing albu
0	i am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old . not only are these children horrible singers , but there is a reason that most parents do n't let their children listen to the original songs ... they teach them things they do n't need to know . i thought this would be a `` kids '' version that would get rid of that stuff when i let a child i was babysitting put the cd on ... and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children . they did n't take that out ! children are exposed to that every day in our world now , telling them it is `` normal '' and `` ok '' . parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today . it becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for `` kids '' that teaches them that those things are `` normal '' . they assume if it is ok for a kids cd , it ca n't be that bad . i think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child ! some of the songs i like in the originial version and do listen to , and this cd has ruined them ! but when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and does n't mean what they say is ok ... i think it is the worst thing you could buy for your child
0	my copy of `` reckless nights ... '' ( and yours , too , probably ) has a sticker on front that reads : `` one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century . '' well , i 'm so glad that columbia cleared that up . otherwise , i 'd have had to make up my own mind , and apparently music labels do n't allow that nowadays . i hope similar stickers are included on chopin , mozart , and bach cds ( with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis ) . scott 's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening , but not in such a large dose -- monotony sets in after two or three titles , let alone 22 . halfway through this cd , i felt as if i were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox . for all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at scott -- no one else like him , no way to categorize his music , and so on , and so on -- the reality is that composers and arrangers like ferde grofe , duke ellington , glenn miller , alec templeton , and bill challis covered the same ground far more skillfully -- and , in most instances , earlier -- than scott . concert jazz , symphonic jazz , or whatever you wish to call it , was not the invention of any one man , and certainly not scott . check out grofe 's scores for whiteman -- in particular , his writing for woodwinds and his constant , scott-esque use of muted trumpet . listen to duke ellington 's `` extended '' compositions circa 1929 . for that matter , listen to ellington 's 1933 `` daybreak express '' -- virtually the template for scott 's galloping miniatures . experience bill challis and glenn miller 's pioneering big band charts . or ... believe as you 're told to believe , i.e . that scott , and scott alone , performed this kind of music . i mean , who needs history when we 've got hype ? it 's up to you , dear listener
1	for those who have watched the movie jaws ( ask yourself , who has n't ) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it . this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly , with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film . the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information , which gives the overall package a nice touch . the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent . a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
0	i forgot how bad this album was until i popped it into my cd player the other day . it seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer , followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom . the song `` epic problem '' is good throughout , and full disclosure is excellent except for the horrible screamed verses . strangelight is awesome too , and not very typical of fugazi . the kill is also good in the same way , it 's very chilled out . past these few standout tracks ( which would n't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs ) there is n't much reason to listen to the album . it 's incredibly boring . i suggest picking up any other fugazi album first , maybe 13 songs , red medicine or in on the kill taker
1	if you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on enigma records , hang on to that out of print gem ! straight to hell is back on cd as straight to hell returns , and may have a lot more tracks this time , but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track . not appearing this time are : `` the good , the bad and the ugly '' by the pogues , and my personal favorite `` money , guns and coffee '' by pray for rain . the track `` the killers '' by pray for rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original , but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes . this is rather perplexing considering straight to hell returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds , which would have left room for those other tracks to be included ( since cds can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds ) . i 'm deducting a point from my rating of this cd because the missing tracks should have been included ! on the plus side , this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original cd release in 1987 , as well as some brief dialogue excerpts . the film was a misunderstood classic , and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful : the pogues , joe strummer , pray for rain , zander schloss , elvis costello 's macmanus gang , and even dialogue excerpts from courtney love before she was , well , i guess the word is `` famous . '' if you 're a fan of any of these artists , you 'll love this assortment of songs ... those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create , so get the film on dvd and you 'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more . the liner notes claim this cd is to be considered the `` official '' soundtrack , while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a `` souvenir . '' i enjoy both releases immensely , but since i was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now , it 's sad to not hear them this time around
0	i was prepared to spend the original $ 26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack . at that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 cds ordered . i was refunded the money to `` the last starfighter '' due to an error listing . when i went to re-order , the new price is $ 49.95 . what a joke ! someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin . i would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition , but until it is sold at a fair price , i will reserve my rating
0	having been a fan of joan osborne 's take of `` son of a preacher man '' on her original indie record and `` heat wave '' from the recent 'standing in the shadows of motown ' soundtrack , i was looking forward to hearing this record of covers . i was ultimately disappointed . first of all , i have to say , there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated , one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound ( the spinners ' `` i 'll be there '' ) and the other for its message ( timmy thomas ' `` why ca n't we live together '' ) . to be sure , there are some great tunes on here that i am always up for listening to , such as stevie wonder 's `` love 's in need of love today '' and undisputed truth 's `` smiling faces somtimes '' , but osborne adds little to these . when she does change things around , the effect is questionable . i know that norah jones has brought back the torch song style , but osborne 's bluesy take on edwin starr 's `` war '' is seriously misguided . the same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like aretha franklin 's `` think '' or the band 's `` the weight '' - especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like osborne . overall , this was a missed opportunity . i hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention
0	hysteria . ** i see great polarities in the reviews of this record . i fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and mtv . i consider that shrewd writing marketing . brilliance is a term i 'll reserve for led zeppelin . i tend to like my rock harder , with two arms and less cheesy . sadly , this record does n't fit the bill . for that , pete willis era def leppard suits me much better . i do n't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown . the important factor here is what you enjoy . if you enjoy superficial 1980s mtv pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here . this album is definetly the former . i 'll beg to differ with the amazon reviewer - it *does* sound dated . its a record thats signifigant for its hype . when listened for its depth . it is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released . prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in
0	this entire cd hbo special is stolen material . all this material was originally written performed by bill hicks . buy hicks dvd `` bill hicks live - satirist , social critic , stand-up comedian '' if you want the material in its true form http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0004z33fk/qid=1130712550/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-5459925-2315938 ? v=glance=dvd bill hicks was also paid tribute on tool 's aenima album
1	i love that garage days re-re visited is on the flip side ... in the cassette i had warped a long time ago ! i like this one
1	i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny , mono phonograph . i loved it then and i love it now . rainmaker , i 'm on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles . i would have loved you anyway is the only song i do n't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny . all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that 's ok ! the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy ! i do n't care if it 's the memories or not , i enjoy putting this on and turning it up
1	every singer ends up attempting sinatra eventually , but few manage so well ... . john pizzarelli has been playing jazz guitar with his legendary father , bucky , since he was 6 years old . john 's latest album is dear mr. sinatra , on which he plays songs written for ol ' blue eyes ... . the crooner is noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative voice , which recall the relaxed stylings of nat `` king '' cole and chet baker , as well as for his fluid , inventive guitar playing . on this album of covers of songs made famous by frank sinatra , john pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of ol ' blue eyes imitations in favor of his own intimate approach , best heard on the set 's more relaxed arrangements . my highlights are the tracks `` i 've got you under my skin '' , `` nice and easy '' and `` you make me feel so young '' . both attention-grabbing and supportive , his expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the ring-a-ding-ding of the rat pack era while steering clear of mere pastiche . with a total time just under 40 minutes , the program is a little short by cd standards , but the performances by john pizzarelli and the clayton-hamilton jazz orchestra in this warm tribute to frank sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit the mark every time .
1	this guy is going to become big someday . i agree with this reviewer : `` the songs on `` seven swans '' , with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them , tell of spiritual tales . they tell of love that transcends the body and age . sufjan can appeal equally to the christian person as to the one who practices zen buddhism . and that is something few songwriters can accomplish . keep an eye on sufjan for years to come . '' i have fun tooling around with `` to be alone with you '' on the guitar , such a simple but infectious melody . `` seven swans '' is not over orchestrated like `` michigan '' and `` illinois '' seem to be . good song to ok song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned cd 's . `` seven swans '' is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of sufjan . sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is . very creative ... he truly forges his own musical path . can not wait for his cd called `` wisconsin . ''
1	this is a very well done record by 3 of raps most elite personalities . cube , dub , mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record . the beats are amazing on all the tracks . this is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button . for me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them . if you 're a fan of the whole west coast gangsta rap thing , you got ta have this ! my fav tracks are `` all the critics in new york '' , `` do you like criminals '' , `` gangsta 's make the world go round '' , `` westward ho ! `` , `` hoo bangin ' '' ... although like i said , all the tracks are badass . peac
1	this is the stuff that rap dreams are made of ! just like the movie itself , this cd is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy ! the talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so , get in , sit down , buckle up and shut the fk up because it 's about to get rowdy up in here !
1	the living in oblivion series of cd compilations does something that many similar compilations do not do : they give us some great variety of `` hits '' . there is no doubt that `` mickey '' by toni basil was a huge hit . there 's also no doubt that `` our lips are sealed '' was a break out hit for the go go 's , but the funboy three version was n't . but what about `` living in a box '' ? it only hit the billboard top 100 at # 89 in 1987 . so why is it here ? why are a large number of these songs ? they 're not top 10 hits , right ? wrong ! i 'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80 's . the u.s. music tastes are typically very different from those of europe . just because a song does n't make the u.s . billboard top 40 does n't mean that it is n't a hit in other countries . and although i 'm an american , my music tastes have always run more in line with those of europe . i 'm delighted that the living in oblivion series ( and the pop and wave series ) have incorporated a variety of hits from the u.s. and europe . i also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations . there are several songs on these albums that never were released on cd ( as they had n't come into being at the time of the groups ' albums initial releases ) , so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits . the boys do n't cry song `` i wan na be a cowboy '' hit the billboard charts at # 12 in 1986 , but the group disappeared soon thereafter . then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000 's and rocketed up the dance charts . do n't be misled , the living in oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80 's . if you want to hear run of the mill , top 40 only hits from the 80 's , well , then you 'll just have to look elsewhere . also , the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever . you get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song 's release . my only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing . apparently many believe that the music from the 80 's was vacuous and devoid of emotion . one need only listen to the song `` the promise '' by the group `` when in rome '' ( living in oblivion volume 5 ) to know that such a statement is false . while that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity , `` the promise '' made the billboard top 100 at # 11 and the billboard dance chart at # 1 . anyway ... i ca n't recommend this album and its entire series any more ! it 's simply awesome ! before believing those who would disparage this series of albums , please check the billboard charts and you 'll see that these songs were in fact hits . get it
1	what a beautiful album ! one of the rare albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts . i 'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty . these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh .
1	i purchased this album from rasputina 's website as soon as it was released there , and it stayed in my cd player ( or technically , it stayed on repeat on my ipod ) for a full fortnight after . it 's full of the rock , groove , beauty , and madness that typefies the live raspy experience . i highly recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in recital , or who have not yet had the pleasure . if you do n't have this recording , buy it now ! wait a minute ... why do n't you have it yet ? the only reason i 've given a rating of 4 , rather than 5 , is that i feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some spots ; it can get a little murky . but for the most part , it sounds pretty good . i 'll also mention , for anyone who does n't know , that zoe 's latest solo cd is now available on her website , zoekeating.com . she 's a wonderful artist in her own right - check it out !
1	as we all know by now , lil ' jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities , but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs . he is truly the king of crunk . many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single , `` get low '' feat . the ying yang twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats , lots of swearing and yelling constantly yeeah ! , whuut ? , and okaay ! buying the edited version ( if there is one ) would be a total waste . this album is not for the meek or faint hearted ! much of the songs hardly have many words from lil jon himself , mostly from the featured artists . these include petey pablo , 8ball and mjg , chyna whyte , pastor troy , jadakiss , styles p. , ect . my faveorites 1 ) throw it up w/ pastor troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat 2 ) get low 3 ) rep yo city w/ petey pablo , bun b- a very good song with talents all around 4 ) knockin ' heads off- again jon struts his stuff 5 ) i do n't give a ... - perfect for before game pumping musi
1	i received `` the piano '' promptly , and in pristine , excellent condition .
0	blues singers should n't try to go mainstream . if they do try and succeed , fine . that means they 've stayed true to their roots . when they try and fail ( as susan has done with hope and desire ) , one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started . for me that was just wo n't burn . i guess when one is happily married with children , it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them . . . you 're faking them
1	as much as i hear time and again that `` mindcrime '' was the seattle quintet 's finest , i always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career . while i was a big fan of mindcrime and it 's predecessor `` the warning '' , rage for order is qr 's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish . in a word.. '' perfect '' . so few bands can boast having made a perfect album . i can think only of the beatles ( sgt . pepper revolver to name a few ) , pink floyd ( the wall , dark side ) , dream theater ( images awake ) , and boston ( debut ) . rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated . released in the hey-day of `` hair metal '' , this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag . none of the songs , while very image provoking , could be easily made into an mtv hit . although `` gon na get close to you '' aired on mtv ( rarely i might add ) it did n't even scratch the surface of this album 's potential . overall , the performances of each member outshine anything before , or since . degarmo and wilton trade licks masterfully . rockenfield and jackson keep a very tight bottom end . tate ... well ... tate was the metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance . while the mix was somewhat lacking , the production was incredible . each song blends into each other perfectly . this was metal that was unique and completely original . i think the term `` thinking man 's metal '' was coined at the time . that said , i can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied . unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time , rage was athmospheric , intellectual , and surreal . rage succeeded where priest 's `` turbo '' failed abysmally . it was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we 'd ever heard before . it was like listening to a whole new machine . it still holds it 's own 20 year later , seeming as fresh and `` now '' as anything in progressive metal .
0	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist . this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side . however , it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out . it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day . i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste . but it is exciting . not here . there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well . now some will like the gentleness i suppose , but with weak material and not much diversity , it sits pretty flat with me
0	it 's not as good as his other albums . he tries too hard and he praises himself way too much . poor guy ; no wonder it had a fake case
1	it was good . there are so many albums like this . this is one of the good ones
0	thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he 's a dumb phony who does n't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still , go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dose n't even scratc
0	i think india is one of the most talented artists today . her voice is sensational . sadly , as with many great artists today , this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven . i understand that regaetton is popular right now . i would even understand including a few reggaeton-flavored songs to `` keep up with the times '' ( shakira 's `` la tortura '' comes to mind ) . but who mixes two genres within a single song ? ! ? `` soy differente '' flows perfectly as a salsa , until regaetton beats come in . the style feels very out-of-place in this song , as in most other songs in this album . maybe this kind of thing will work at a club , but not for extended listening . in my opinion , the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling india 's own style . i hope she will regain contol by the next album
0	as much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release . in fact one wonders why it was released at all . billy 's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown . from the sound of things billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication . a lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience . why this was put on the cd is anyones guess but it just neans less songs ! however the good news is that this cd has now been blown away by his superb new 12 gardens cd in which billy is the billy of old . the one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung . 12 gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there 's no timewaisting audience chat ! !
0	read the the second reveiw from the bottom that says a music fan from the east coast . the olny good song on this cd is fly
1	if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy . it is the best debut album since definatly mayby . tracks like `` golden touch '' `` v.i.c.e '' well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging '' stumbble and fall '' which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds . if you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
1	this is a fabulous cd and exactly what i was looking for . i 'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music . i am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the songs before , so i wanted the traditional melodies , easy to follow sheet music , and easy guitar chords . this is perfect ! i 'm so pleased
0	sarah brightman is one of my all time favorite artists . but this disc is just a complete waste . it is missing so much , and has too many songs that do n't belong . like the phantom songs . as much as i love them , save them for the andrew llyod webber collections . ca n't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from `` dive '' ? her `` classics '' album had it right . except their version of `` captain nemo '' was the rip off live version . and this cd does n't even have the captain nemo song , which is a huge fan favorite , and definitly was a single . it is also missing how can heaven love me , eden , harem , and beautiful . all singles as well . save your money . either buy the `` classics '' album for a somewhat better compilation , or just make your own mix like i did . because sarah has so many wonderful songs ( and quite a few bad ones i will admit ) and it seems on here they give you some bad ones ( like requium and nella fantasia ) , and leave out the good ones . `` it 's a beautiful day '' and `` what you never know '' are good , but are the weakest songs form harem . why on earth would you leave out `` harem '' and `` beautiful '' , but leave on beautiful day and wynk ? whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in . i bet sarah did n't have much say in this compilation . this is just a waste . beautiful album cover though
1	well , here we are . one of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90 's , `` lifeforms '' is true sonic adventure . this is obviously some of the best work that fsol ever did . `` lifeforms '' is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together , interchanged and meshed . for ambient work , it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace . there is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs , despite their being ambient . it is very original , i praise originality in music . give it a try , put on some `` flower '' `` bird wings '' or some `` elaborate burn .
1	hey bret is one of the most tallented song writers of our time ! he will be in the rock n ' roll hall of fame when he is done and his guitar playin ' and singin ' is very underrated ! buy this
1	this film came out in 1973 and i saw it in its original full length version ( about 3hours and 15 min . ) executives from columbia pictures were there , it was the premeire , and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out ( verbal ) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums . the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free . we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon , the miscasting , the terrible sets , the odd ball music for the story , the dubbed liv ullmann , the dance routines of olivia hussey..all of it . you can not find a musical like it , or a soundtrack like it . columbia execs were unimaginative ; they should have believed in this film . the next day after this premeire in boston , new york etc . ( simultaneous i suppose ) the film was cut , the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..t shirts , dolls , posters of all sizes , bath towels with the poster on them , records of the sd tk of course , and small pop up sets of the entire film . it was to be a massive hit..in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed , and the posters said , last two weeks , and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared . but many people came to see it..lines of people , and , when they heard it had been cut , they gave up , and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film . i have many treasures from that opening nite , and now i have the cd of the sound track . anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film ; it is unique . enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd ..they are out there
1	when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark , starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights , but by the music she sang and how she deeply , richly portrayed those songs . she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well . i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her music ... she truly is addicting once you hear these songs ... these songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey
1	to be honest i ca n't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i 've heard . for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time , never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one . my favourite songs on the album are `` the only moment we were alone '' and `` six days at the bottom of the ocean '' every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i 'm am fixated on nothing else but them . i literally can not communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently . this album is not as experimental as `` those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever '' but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well , with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be . i love the pure , clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind . the trance that this album provides is indescribable ; i 'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note . either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase , for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced , written , recorded , thought out and sounding . buy it , you will not regret your choice one bit .
0	rhymefest is an ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping . man , i thought i was in for a classic hip hop album , it was like the lakers were ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track . i admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ai n't hittin i could care less what you 're rapping about . rhymefest used so many r singers i thought i was listening to some old new edition or after 7 joints not that i do n't like those singers but i do n't want to hear that on no hip hop album . if you want to hear some real chicago hip hop check out all natural the best besides common to ever come from the city of wind
0	i was a huge fan of the jam , but ive grown to despise paul weller and this cd strengthens my view . this is a covers cd and has n't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.with paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations , rarities , box sets and dvd 's in the last few years . [ since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band ] .this album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto
1	i 've always written how the american now compilations do not even come close to the british ones , and my opinion has not since changed . now 20 's track list , however , is solid and pretty good for the american series . it has mostly good rap songs ( which can be sometimes rare in this series ) , great rock songs , and not an overload of mediocrities . i 'll go in depth . 1 . missy elliott feat . ciara fatman scoop - lose control ... a a great rap song - missy elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable . ciara is a nice addition to the song . fatman scoop 's random screaming in the background was n't essential , but it at least adds some energy to the track . the music 's actually interesting and something different from everything else . 2 . black eyed peas - do n't phunk with my heart ... c+ their first album was stellar , and their second is as well . but this was one of the worst tracks on `` monkey business '' and did not deserve to become a single . annoying , but not horrible . 3 . pussycat dolls feat . busta rhymes - do n't cha ... a- a really good rap song - busta 's rapping is a good addition to the song , making this radio remix better than the original on the pussycat dolls ' album , `` pcd '' . a dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade . 4 . rihanna - pon de replay ... b+ pretty catchy , and a good party song . but it gets pretty irritating after a while . and the `` dip it low and you pick it up slow '' from the first verse directly copies from christina milian 's `` dip it low '' . that 's so unoriginal , rihanna ! 5 . ludacris feat . bobby valentino - pimpin ' all over the world ... b good music , but it 's not much without the video , which was , by the way , partly shot in africa . 6 . bow wow feat . ciara - like you ... b bow wow 's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded , but ciara 's chorus makes this song better than mediocre . 7 . dem franchize boys feat . jermaine dupri , da brat bow wow - i think they like me ( remix ) ... c this song does not deserve the publicity , and i 'm stunned why people like this . it 's worse than mediocre , it 's horribly irritating . and much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty . rap just is n't rap when it 's edited , and this song is proof . but even without the editing i do n't think this song has a chance . annoying `` yep '' s in the background and mediocre rapping ... just skip it already . 8 . destiny 's child - cater 2u ... b- mediocre for destiny 's child . actually pretty boring . but they have great voices . 9 . lyfe jennings - must be nice ... c+ mediocre . 10 . natasha bedingfield - these words ... a a great `` new '' artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the us . great songwriting about bad songwriting ( if that makes any sense at all ) and a good voice . now i 'm just wondering when her brother daniel 's going to release another `` if you 're not the one '' . 11 . kelly clarkson - behind these hazel eyes ... a- the only american idol who earned over twenty minutes of success , kelly 's finding massive success with her second album , and for a reason - she 's got an awesome voice , and pulls off rock quite well . this song was brutally murdered by the radio , but that 's why i 've moved onto the remixes ( not on this album ) . 12 . d.h.t . - listen to your heart ( unplugged version ) ... a though furios f.ez 's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version , this amazing cover of the roxette track deserved all the fame it got . edmee 's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her . beautiful song also . 13 . backstreet boys - just want you to know ... a- the backstreet boys ' newest album must have been the # 1 most unwanted comeback of all time ( let 's just hope n*sync does n't follow ... *cringe* justin timberlake ) , but this is their best song . and this comes from someone hard to impress by the backstreet boys , but they pull off this rock song pretty well . 14 . click 5 - just the girl ... a a really good rock song which many can relate to . 15 . franz ferdinand - do you want to ... b atonal , but franz ferdinand has a good reputation , so i 'll let it slide . but this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump . 16 . weezer - beverly hills ... a+ unfortunately it was flattened , torn apart , and buried alive by the radios , so i will review it as it was still last summer when i first heard it . this song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe . but i do n't need to write this , as most people already know . 17 . fall out boy - sugar we 're going down ... a an amazing song , but it 's only good if you can put up with songs where you ca n't understand what they 're saying . seriously , it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what 's being said here . but the music is great , and this song overall is a pretty good rock track . 18 . lifehouse - you me ... a- an instant classic . 19 . coldplay - fix you ... a+ i 've read mixed reviews about this song , but personally , i think its amazing . following a vaguely similar buildup as led zeppelin 's `` stairway to heaven '' , this song just keeps you listening until the end . the rockout part at the end is magical . 20 . keith urban - you 'll think of me ... b it 's somewhat annoying that keith 's been on now albums consistently for a while but his songs are n't as popular as , say , gretchen wilson . i 'm starting to think keith 's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there . a good song , but it could 've been replaced with something better in the country department . so overall , this is a great selection of songs , some amazing , some decent , and some mediocre to bad . i 'd suggest you buy this , as it 's a good list of tracks . overall , this album gets a b+ .
0	this is as bad as the film.in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula.will & amp ; his movies & amp ; music never change the same old beat.the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad.unoriginal & amp ; boring.what a waste of kool moe dee
0	..and what 's the point ? all of these songs ( minus a few ) are on the anthology , along with countless others . the beastie boys did n't put this out , their record label did . it 's just way for corporate to make money . if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan , that is you 're interested in all the other music they made that was n't put on radio , then do n't buy this . if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song , then go ahead . the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits . to fully appreciate them , you have to listen to an album all the way through .
0	..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women . first it was britney spears , then it was christina aguilera , now it 's joss stone . the former at least have something going for them ; britney 's first album had catchy beats , and even though aguilera 's style is incredibly trashy , she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard . try as i might , though , i just do n't understand the appeal of joss stone . i did n't buy this album ; a friend of mine likes it and i 've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head . i do n't see what is fresh or original about ripping off janis joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers . maybe it 's the rick astley effect : you do n't expect that voice coming out of that face . you do n't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat . but that effect can only take you so far , as rick astley himself found out . this album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ( `` dirty man '' basically just repeats `` you 're a dirty man ... '' with very minor variations , along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling ) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of stone herself - it 's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk , when it ca n't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more `` cool '' . stone , like aguilera and spears , tries to sing like an older black woman , a woman with soul - an aretha franklin or a gloria gaynor . but stone et al . sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes . they have n't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate . their singing rings hollow to me , show-offy and fake . stone could rival aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics , though she has nowhere near aguilera 's sweetness or range . her voice might be described as `` smoky '' by some ; to me it sounds gravelly , sandpapery , and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt . i do n't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this cd , much less enjoy it . i guess fake is good enough for some people . it makes me chuckle , though , to hear people rave about her voice as `` authentic '' . if you 're looking for soul , try macy gray . she 's for real . try the hugely talented but woefully ignored tasmin archer and karen rodriguez . those are fresh , authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks joss stone and her ilk truly are . the only white woman i have ever heard who could sing like she was black was linda ronstadt . go back and listen to a ronstadt classic like `` hurts so bad '' and compare it to this modern-day drivel . ronstadt sang with real feeling , real knowledge , real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days . i gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option . joss stone is just a musical chav , an unconvincing shoplifter of another , better culture
0	i had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50 's and 60 's jazz legends - before they became household names . it was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again . i heard brief notes from this cd and i must agree that mr. winston did attempt to capture mr. guaraldi 's timeless expressions , but the this production did not have the same `` golden flow '' as the original .
0	beautiful voice , but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd . i was offended just reading every name on this cd ... it is really a shame , what pretty `` vulgar '' voice . if this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears . you should be ashamed of yourself as an artist , as you have such power , but it is spent on prepetuating hate . nina simone was a angry artist also , but not once did she offend me ( caucasian male ) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america . the first song i ever heard of hers `` mississippi goddam '' made me cry , so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice . there will always be a `` racist america '' because people are selfish , but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist . i liked the cd until i heard the lyrics , one less sale adds up after awhile
1	and finding stories of stacks of old vinyls , dripping yesterday and glowing always . cali 's finest , madlib , is definitely one of the heirs of dj premiere , pete rock , dj quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated . the latest madlib invasion is not for everybody ; those of us who 's butts were undeniably moved by tribe 's `` low end theory '' will definitely appreciate this endeavor . those of you who are tired of what mtv and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop , clean out your crazy uncle otis 's attic check out the beat konducta . then walk down the street to mr. yancey 's house , go into his basement and check out j dilla 's `` donuts .
0	jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice , but you wo n't get the chance to hear it on this cd . this cd is a complete let down . it is her worst one yet ! do n't get me wrong . i love jessica , but seeing her waste her god given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so ... tragic
1	almost a classic in my book . we bumped this on the southside of chicago when this dropped . these two were like a west coast epmd because they blended perfectly . u could tell them apart easily because gangsta d had the eazy-e voice with the hard lyrics . while kk had a gruff voice and was a str8 clown . kk would say anything . once again the whole crew is on this one also : quik , hi-c , and amg . they had a tight click that just seemed to from voltron how they worked together . my favorites on this album are : if u want it , be true 2 yourself , let the rhythm , and just ai n't me ( kk solo ) . i still take hoodrats on `` triple mmm shots '' ... ..listen to the album to find the meaning . hotep ! !
1	review no.77.a superbly/nicely done reissue of the zombie 's second 'actual ' album ( is n't it ? ) .total of 27 tracks , so since the first twelve ( 12 ) cuts were the original lp , i guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks , wow ! that 's a lot , for a one-disc release.a fine cd to repeatedly play , plus keep in your 'current rotation ' stack for a long time to come.it 's probably just me , but these tunes should be in a different playing order.that 's why i 'll sometimes pre-program this cd before i listen to it.loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here , like `` care of cell 44 '' ( three versions , but welcome ) , '' time of the season '' ( stereo and mono versions ) , the beautifully-done melodic `` a rose for emily '' ( 2 versions ) , '' i want her , she wants me '' , '' maybe after he 's gone '' and a cut that i 've certainly never heard before , but was quite impressed with it , '' butchers tale '' .obviously , the zombies must 've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world did n't take great notice of , until now.simply , a must-have.timeless top rate british invasion rock that 'll never truly die
0	i used to like good charlotte , enough that i bought this cd , but i really do n't like them at all anymore . they try to look all punk , but they are pop . they whine a lot . i think it 's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool . they should at least stop doing songs about it . they have some ok melodies and words , but for the most part all their songs sound the same . good charlottes first two cd 's were almost good , but this one is bad and really whiny
1	one of the great metal albums of our time . from the drumming to the guitar alls that can be said is amazing .
0	i may not be an expert on steel drums , but i do listen to jimmy buffett a lot ! he has a great steel drum drummer . after listening to this cd , i gave it away in a white elephant gift exchange this past xmas
1	when i bought this cd i did not know that much about supergrass . the only songs i had even heard were `` pumping on the stereo '' and `` sun hits the sky '' and i liked both of these songs a lot . so while i was cruising the aisles in the record shop , my eyes caught a glimpse of supergrass is 10 , so i decided to buy it because it was at a great price , and i am glad i did . the cd has not left my car since i bought it two months ago . every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head , and you won'tbe upset . from the opening track `` caught by the fuzz '' to the finale `` wait for the sun '' the album just rock throughout , and everytime i listen to it i want more . the album clocks in at 71 minutes , but everytime i am done listenintg to it i feel unfulfilled . that is a sign of a band making great music
1	this cd brings back memories of the early 60 's when vince martin and fred neil played at the flick , the coffee house , and the hootenanny here in miami . i 've had the lp forever . now that i 'm getting the cd , i can listen in my car and remember seeing them perform live
1	the debut release entitled `` breathe '' by artist called blue stone is one of the best new age albums that i 've heard in years ! i would even go as to say that it is even better than any of amethystiums albums . `` i am '' is heavenly and `` contact '' is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic !
1	joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r b history . he 's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties . this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles , elton john and gary wright . his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs , but in dts 5.1 , you are surrounded ( as if in concert ) by his presence . the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance . imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you 'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album
0	after norah 's first two cds and the little willie 's cd i was greatly looking forward to this release . to say the least i am disappointed . i was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep . where is the range of work ? all of the songs on this cd sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me . i 'm giving it 2 stars just because of norah 's angelic voice , otherwise i 'd have to give this one a 1 star rating
0	it 's loud . you ca n't hear the lyrics nor the words . just a lot of loud noise . great if you want to damage your hearing
0	this great underground master dj deservedly gets a release on a major record label ... but there are too many rappers , not enough personality in the production , and obvious restraint in the sampling ( surely the result of copyright clearance issues . ) compared to z-trip 's amazing and audacious uneasy listening with dj-p and live at the future primitive with radar , this is just a bore ... yawn ...
1	this is a fantastic holiday christmas album . doris day 's beautiful voice singing these terrific christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all who listen years of enjoyment . a must have for those who enjoy hearing terrific christmas music over the holidays
0	i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they 're funny . heh , so witty . anywho i 'm not a big fan of fall out boy , but there are a couple of good songs on this cd ... ... ..notably grand theft autumn and saturday . those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho ... 2 stars
0	i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan . i 'm a huge pet sounds fan , but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from `` the left banke '' to `` beulah . '' this album is not that good , people . it 's not even `` okay . '' there are way better takes on the `` brian wilson '' ( read : phil spector ) sound . whether it 's `` the ladybug transistor '' or `` the apples in stereo . '' heck , check out a great vancouver band called `` ashley park '' as well . the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it 's almost unlistenable . they may be good road musicians but it does n't show on this album , especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops `` a la stone roses . '' you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label 's recordings or even merge stuff . to be honest , i did n't even find the compositions that scintillating , regardless of the production . chord and change-wise , they 're interesting ... .but that does n't make the songs good .
1	pete rock and c.l . smooth came out of no where with this classic in `` 92 '' . i was expecting the t-roy tribute to be the only highlight , but this joint was bangin ! the very underrated cl had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics . chocolate boy wonder had the legendary `` horns '' going on . the whole album is a banger . fav 's are pete 's sake , the basement ( pete 's cuz heavy d rips it ) , mecca and the soul brother , troy- they reminisce , straighten it out ( a kick in the balls for bootleggers ) , ghetto 's of the mind and skinz ( cl 's cuz grand puba steals the show on this one ) . eternally classic , rock on .
1	right , so , you 're reading this either because you are a big oasis fan and realize that this album is wonderful , or because you 've heard some oasis songs on the ever-disappointingly-dull radio and it 's sparked yer interest . `` the masterplan '' is a compilation of oasis b-sides that have been released over the years . what has always made oasis the best band in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on their `` albums proper '' are not necessarily their best songs . as such , songs like `` acquiesce '' , `` talk tonight '' and `` stay young '' are vacant on their albums , yet they represent the best of this lovely band and are included here in stunning fashion . so in summary , i absolutely do not recommend you buy this album until you at least own and fall in love with `` definitely maybe '' and `` morning glory '' . to those who own and love this album , it is a part of rock history and is not to be overlooked .
1	saw this fella in 'you see me laughin ' on ifc . good straight ahead delta style blues . this is the real deal
1	chandos ' grainger edition is a significant contribution to modern art . this particular volume ( vol . 14 ) features grainger 's settings of various folk and popular songs which he made in the first quarter of the 20th century . the accompaniments are set for small ensembles , and grainger utilized the harmonium on many of the song settings on this disc . sound is 24-bit

1	as a pretty big comedy fan thanks to xm radio , i have listened to a lot of comics and i own a lot of comic cd 's ( mitch hedberg , bill hicks , emo philips , lewis black , steven wright , pablo francisco etc . ) and my absolute favorite is unprotected . there is not a slow part on this cd and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride . his quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the us . his family must be very understanding since he does n't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act , but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to . the highlights of this cd are his daughter 's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack . i highly highly reccomend this
1	even though mitchell wanted to feel reckless in this album , she accomplished one thing with her music : coming closer to weather report . it 's obvious she loved its jazz-fusion and admired jaco pastorious and wayne shorter so much to have invited them to reach their peaks , but as master musicians they could only achieved what joni allowed them to do . in `` paprika plains '' ( a song over 16 min . long ) joni unloads wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode at the last two and half minutes . i would have hoped to hear a longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of weather report 's reputation . over all the album is interesting because mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny limb ... .

1	adios marks the real goodbye from kmfdm . after they went on to do mdfmk which was decent and then they came back . attak , was really weak because it was all sascha and skold and though i like them both , the absence of gunter schulz and en esch really made this album absent in itself . wwiii though it is a better and pretty decent album , kmfdm is still a little less present . adios gives us the remnants of what kmfdm fans know as kmfdm with skold present but not taking over completely ( though i like skold , but we need a break ) we saw nina hagen lend her voice in `` witness '' which is amazing , along with ogre from skinny puppy in `` that 's all '' and `` full worm garden '' great tracks a little bit of pig and schulz 's insane guitar riffs and you are all set . even though en esch was very minimal in the recording , infact i barely remember him ... currently working on `` fubar '' , we 'll see if kmfdm will impress again , they have it still , they are just not using their talents as of late , c'mon sascha , you 're great man , but get over yourself and get schulz and esch back ... bring back kmfdm ... what would skinny puppy be without cevin key ? what would ohgr be without ogre ? what would foetus be without thirlwell ? c'mon man.. bring us back kmfdm ...
0	metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton , as this album is prime evidence of . he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here . also , newstead only gets one song on this album , which is ironically the best song on the album . in the history of metallica , this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial
0	a tenor very quickly on the rise , this is villazon 's second recital disc , one devoted to arias by gounod and massenet , all in sets of three , three for massenet , and two for gounod . while still showing great promise , some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so , in the french repertoire , in part because diction comes up so short here . `` o souverain '' from le cid continues to show villazon 's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register , so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary . diction here is already an issue , as many `u ' vowels get dipthonged , especially when villazon 's sound is placed back for added weight and volume . `la reve ' from massenet 's manon is comfortably floated , with support from natalie dessay as manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number . would villazon been able to sing the short aria by alain ( who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of frau ohne schatten perhaps ? - in almost a chamber opera ) , from massenet 's griselidis ( track 8 ) , at least as softly and lightly , as both the music and dramatic situation require , this could have also been very successful . he instead turns the aba shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it . the less often excerpted `` lorsque enfant '' from werther closes out the first massenet set , as does `` pourquoi me reveiller '' the second . villazon 's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both . he capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection , and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well . it is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from massenet 's roi de lahore , featuring a hero ( from hindu myth ) that bound to certain stipulations , has literally returned from the dead . not quite as ostentatious as massenet 's near remake of lohengrin , esclarmonde ( but with female protagonist instead ) , it is one of massenet 's most colorful scores . it has only been recorded complete once commercially , with joan sutherland , luis lima , and appearing only ten minutes apart , james morris , and for the part of general unfortunately eliminated from this scene here , john tomlinson , along with one other cut to villazon 's part . it would 've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias . he captures the incipiently worried tone of alim well , but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from french culture as where the opera takes place . most successful of the gounod selections are two of the three rarities . the first is source delicieuse from polyeucte , based on the corneille play . it opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege . it perhaps has only been recorded once before and well , by roberto alagna ten years ago ; villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well , if not as securely as alagna . anges du paradis from mireille ( which mirella freni championed and recorded complete for emi ) , is third , perhaps a study for ah leve toi , soleil ( romeo ) , several years down the road . the second gounod rarity on this disc is `` inspirez-moi , race divine , '' said to be a caruso favorite , from reine de saba . its text indicates king solomon 's prize hired builder , adoniram , to be a very confident , if mildly haughty chap . villazon 's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back , with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing villazon engages in here . the high c at the end , however , is convincing . such device as in the above , also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from romeo et juliette . `` ah ! leve toi soleil '' opens the first gounod set , and is sung with the right ardor , conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops , coming off phrases . villazon 's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat , and intonation gets momentarily derailed . `` salut , demeure '' from gounod 's faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome . recitative and the beginning of the aria , `` ah ! fuyez '' from manon begin well nuanced enough , and for the aria , truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc , but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long . that leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two massenet rarities , to close this recital - first , an aria from roma , massenet 's swan song for the lyric theater and `` ah ! parais '' from le mage , opera with plot line similar to that of verdi 's aida , following . the melody , introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter , somewhat takes after `` pays merveilleux '' from meyerbeer 's africaine , but in more voluptuous color , such as in thais , and villazon and pido both capitalize well on its opulence . pido 's work , on numerous other numbers on this disc , seems heavy , lumbering , cloying , or just simply out of his idiom , so to speak . word has it that villazon , while not having a big voice , is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing . how this picked up a major award from gramophone , for the specific problems this disc has , and over two more qualified nominations ( ciofi/di donato handel duets and a florez album ) is mystifying . so much digression here is over the very specific demands that french opera makes on singers . there 's much reason for hope for this tenor , but this disc , for two-thirds of it , does little to help fulfill it
1	nas ' street 's disciple definitely has plenty of memorable/outstanding cuts on it . nas sounds very confident and his lyrical skill is prevelant throughout both discs . the subject matter varies which is way cool in that , it delivers to all audiences of his fans . every nas fan will be doing themselves a huge favor by supportin him and pickin this up today . a
1	nightrage - descent into chaos - thomas lindberg 's latest offering to the music community is the swedish and greek mix called nightrage . this album actually being my first offering to the band i was unsure what to expect . like most i am a big fan of atg and lindberg 's harsh vocal styles ... . nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise . ( as in it was n't , yet another , atg clone ) they seem to have more melody than thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres ... . the haunted , where the former atg guitar players are now located , seemed have gone with more thrash then melody . ( which is odd since they actually have atg 's guitar players ? ) anyway , enough comparisons ! nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene ... amazing guitar work and one of the genres best vocalist makes this cd well worth a couple of listens . also i 've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens . favorite songs : being nothing , phantasma , omen , and descent into chaos . -4 stars if you liked , agreed , or appreciated this please click yes for : `` was this review helpful ? ''
0	this completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original . overblown , overproduced mackintosh garbage . if he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage , i 'm sure he would n't have hesitated . mr. banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst . and the omission of `` sister suffragettes '' smacks of pc nonsense
0	um . i have nothing against bands that are `` mainstream '' . that has nothing to do with their quality of sound . ( granted , many mainstream bands are horrible , but they all deserve a chance , no ? ) dave , though , he has never impressed me . not that he 's awful , i suppose it 's okay background music ... better than nothing . just oh so mediocre . i do n't understand why is he so highly praised ? voice-wise ? eh . nothing special . lyrics ? hah ! music ? umm ... bland ? it 's all the same ! maybe i 'm missing something ? if you like one of dave 's songs , then by all means , buy this ! you can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song . two stars because it 's at least music . but that 's on the high side , considering how static it is . dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer .
0	this product is listed as `` limited edition special packaging '' at a cost of $ 30.99 . it 's nothing but an ordinary cd in a plastic jewel case with a `` made in hong kong '' sticker on the back . it 's the import version . there 's nothing `` special '' about the packaging . save your money and get the domestic version for $ 14 . the album itself is awesome by the way . nick cave continues to make fantastic albums . even though i feel ripped-off by amazon 's inaccurate advertising i must say this album is totally worth having . this is raw and noisy . it 's removed from the introspective albums that nick cave has produced with the bad seeds recently but is better conceived than any birthday party record ever was . it 's not the bad seeds . it 's not the birthday party . it 's grinderman ! to be fair , i asked amazon to refund the price difference between this misleading product and the domestic version , the difference being about $ 17.. they agreed and i got my refund in no time . thanks amazon , great customer service
0	let me tell you , shayne ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks , if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today , face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him . look at justin timberlake , where is he today , they go and move on , and thats what shayne will do except alot faster . this song is so rubbish , the thing i hate so much is that he did n't even write this ! so its not his own material , and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song , its not like these lyrics mean anything to him , as he did not write . and on `` no promises '' thats even worse than this , yes he might of wrote it i do n't know , but does the song have depth , or is it just a plain old expected pop song . by the way it 's the second one . shayne ward has no protential , neather does anyone who comes of x factor , its all just one big [ ...
1	i was looking for some nice background nature sounds to have playing while i work throughout the day . this collection hits the spot . great sounds , great variety , great price
0	i 'm sure glad i did not purchase this cd . back in the 1980 's i had very little knowledge about o'bryan burnnette , but now that i am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more , i know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation . `` soul trains a comin '' ( although not a chart hit ) was missing . i would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for soul train from seasons 13- '' maria '' ( a lackluster lp track from his latest lp , surrender ) should have been replaced with the beautiful `` together always '' ( from his proper sophmore lp , you i ) . the horrible and silly `` drivin ' force '' ( also from surrender ) should have been out ! `` lovelite '' , `` you i '' and `` i 'm freaky '' lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well ! ! `` is this for real , '' right from the start , '' and `` love has found its way . '' were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well . the absense of `` soul trains a comin ' ( original ) '' , `` together always '' , and full versions of `` you i '' , `` i 'm freaky '' , and `` lovelite '' really knocked off 3 points from best of o'bryan cd and should be made into a redo ! ! for those that wasted thier money on this , `` go on and cry '' because right stuff records done ripped y'all off ! ! this underated talented artist ( good singer , writer , producer , and instrumentalist ) was trying to be the next prince and michael jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of carl thomas ( too soulful for the mainstream ) . people must have bought this cd ( if do not have original lps no more ) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds . i admit i love all the songs from the cd ( except for maria and driving force ) , but i will create a new cd under my productions , soul train alumni series along with my own compilations of shalamar , jermaine stewart , pebbles , jody watley and other soul train almumnis . 1 . soul trains a comin ' ( original although i love the remix ; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro ) 2 . the gigolo 3 . still waters 4 . right from the start ( great track and catchy hooks ! ! ) 5 . i 'm freaky ( full lp verison , the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version ) 6 . you i ( full original lp version . loved the closing ) 7 . together always ( o showed his true feelings on this 1983 track ) 8 . lovelite ( full original lp version - lovelite baby ! ! ) 9 . breakin ' together ( good effort and loved the video ! ! ) 10 . go on cry ( good ballad ) 11 . lady i love you ( what ever happened to lovin ' your woman and tellin ' her how you feel . this was his best ballad ever and this should school young catz like bobby valentino and r kelly on real love . ) 12 . you 're always on my mind ( i 'm glad they included this lp track from 1984 's be my lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo . beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she 's seeing someone else ) . 13 . tenderoni ( 45 single , i never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single ) 14 . is this for real ( great ! ! ! ) 15 . you have got to come to me ( beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts ) this here is the real best of o'bryan plus more . wish i can add more like `` i 'm in love again '' , `` doin ' alright '' , `` surrender '' `` love had found its way '' and `` shake '' but had to pick the best 16 that would fit ! ! -- thank you ! !
0	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know . but to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds . this is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music . another double ambient album - seti - pharos - is a real masterpiece . it is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album . please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova @ yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts .
1	chris joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms , afros and platform shoes ! joss ' `` you 've been spiked '' is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever ! in fact , this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70 's ... but it 's all circa the 21st century . it 's good to know that there are still modern cats ( especially on the esl record label ) who know how to recapture music from days gone by .
1	i first encountered bird3 opening for veruca salt the summer of 2001 . that band had put their faith into bird and so have i . we fell in love with them all together . this band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique , beautiful , and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today . you 'll find yourself not only humming along , but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments . you will not once regret buying this piece of art
0	for fans , i suppose this would be a rather big delight ; for non-fans , it 's nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey . they had some okay , cheesy hits in the '80s - but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays
1	and you will to . this music conveys the happy feeling of latin music produced for the american ear from 1946 to 1949 . i picked up the album from amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the yahoo music radio service -- `` el cumbanchero '' and `` cuban pete '' . the cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded , especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued . `` babalu '' which became desi arnez signature piece on the i love lucy tv show is probably one of the least appealing , and that may be why it was used comedically in the tv show through the years . the highlight cuts include -- `` peanut vender '' , `` holiday in havana '' , `` you can in yucatan '' and `` brazil '' . while brass , strings , drums and guitars tend to dominate much of today 's music , this album gives the spotlight to a variety of percussion instruments , flute , clarinet and bass clarinet . it is refreshing to hear them in solo . the liner notes by will friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period of desi 's life between his movie career and the defining work he and lucille ball did on television in the 50 's . i could not recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as i did
1	`` the passion of the christ - songs '' is a fine collection of great songs , each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that mel gibson has created . the standouts are the song `` i see love '' by steven curtis chapman , third day an mercyme ; scott stapp 's powerful solo debut song `` relearn love ; '' `` rainy day '' by big dismal , and the emotional `` new again '' by brad paisley and sarah evans . despite a couple of songs that do n't reach their true potential ( `` the passion , '' and `` how many lashes '' ) , this is a fine cd that belongs in anyone 's and everyone 's christian music collection . grade : a-
1	what a wonderful and diverse cd . sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of oregon pinot noir in your hand . close your eyes relax and let the sounds of liebert surround you . his talent is evident in the expressions as he 's playing . the guitar seems an extension of his own form , not a separate instrument .
1	i had tears in my eyes when i first heard this album . i get emotional over music i really like , and this album got to me.so many great standards so well delivered by the duo . they deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so do n't look for uptempo , snappy songs in this one.not that harry warren could not write faster stuff like jeepers creepers , shuffling off to buffalo etc . this album is to sing along with softly or hum.i kept thinking of bogart in the rain in casablanca and other lovers in w.wii.i know the main tune in that movie was not by harry warren ; it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by julie styne [ time after time ] and the grossly underrated harry warren.grab someone you love , some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.they should do more harry warren albums , michael and george.i thank them profusely
1	forget the nit-picky comments you may read here , if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album , buy it ! the recording is of very high quality , and i agree with another review , vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better . the banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live . one other observation , if you buy this not having a huge appreciation for sammy already , you will be blown away by his talent . ..thanks to sinatra family for releasing this disc . hopefully many more are forthcoming
1	great cd for young and old alike . the music puts a smile on your face each time you listen to it . i have it on in my car and it keeps me in a good mood at all times
0	i have been a nin fan since pretty hate machine . i think trent reznor is a brilliant musician . all of his previous albums have been absolute genius ... .until this ? i pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece . what a disappointment ! ! i still ca n't get over how terrible this album is ! the only song that is worth mentioning is `` you know what you are . '' that 's the trent i know ! i purposely skipped the tour just so i did n't have to hear the new stuff ! i hope this is n't it for him , but i will be cautious when the next album comes out
0	i really ca n't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record . first off , i bought it without hearing anything by them before , but it had been highly recomended to people who like tool and mars volta by amazon ! ! they coul n't have been any more wrong . so , why did i personally find this so painfull ? well , the whole thing in general is quite painfull . first off , the musicians . the whole band sound like studio musicians . no obvious indivuality or anything new to offer . then we get to the vocals . the closest thing i can compare them to are alison moyet or anthony and the johnsons . i do n't mind anthony and the johnsons , but this guys vocals and the music just do n't rock . which is fine . it 's ok not to rock ! but why the hell , being a tool fan and mars volta fan , was i recomended this ? it 's bland , it 's week , and the dubby bass , boring guitar playing/sound ... weak vocals.. actually , forget it . the whole package . it is just lame
0	cheap trick 's second album is very disappointing to me after the good , but raw , `` live in the studio '' , 1977-76 recorded cheap trick . almost all of the material here is so watered down that it really comes off way better on the later many live disks they did . after a good start w/ `` hello there '' , a concert favorite for many years , is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the budokan and other live recordings later . tom werman and rick niesen were on a show in 1991 that i had recorded on a tape once and werman , noce a friend of tom petersson 's said , quote : `` my three albums with cheap trick got better and better ... '' , to which the ever sarcastic rick nielsen said , `` selling , maybe . '' not realizing that brother rick was slamming him , werman then continued , `` exactly '' ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums through the years has become like playing russian roulette . it 's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid , but somewhat oeverrated 'heaven tonight ' came out ... ( and the guys even bought werman back for dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined the band . yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80 '
0	i want this guy to succeed so badly , yet he just could n't pull it off . his voice has a great sound to it , pleasant to the ears , yet his interpretation was just not there . his phrasing was very lazy and boring most times . it seemed like he did n't know where to start the next word . and he also sounded out of breath . he sounded so out of breath that i started gasping for air ... i had to stop listening . to add to that , john 's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger . i truly hope with age and experience he improves . there 's no reason why he should not . he 's not in the catagory of a buble ' or connick jr. yet .
0	when will amazon allow a zero stars rating ? ? ? ?
0	there are some artists who have been active since the 60 's and 70 's and who are still producing vibrant , excellent music . paul simon , say , or bob dylan . kate bush , though she started a little later . all of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great . joni mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead . maybe i do n't rate as a jm fan because i 've only heard blue , but i 've listened to that album hundreds of times times over the years . i wanted to find out what she was up to since then , and bought this album . all i have to say is , it was like nails on a chalkboard . i was expecting her to change and grow , but not into some pale ghost of the 60 's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism . the lyrics are old and tired , and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale , too . the only good lyrics on this album were provided by yates . at least her paintings are good .
0	this is junk not music.neon moon is the worst song ever ! it is so boring and dull.and a cool drink of water is a horribly written and sung song ! this music bores me ! leave it alone and stick to rap , rock , or metal.country sucks
0	if this is n't worst dead album then in the dark is
1	for those of us who thought phil collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture , think again ... that was back in the early 80s when i heard this.. it is mastery distille
1	this was 2pac 's last good album before he joined deathrow.he was a good rapper but never the best , he started too much beef with other rappers for no reason.he had alot of beef with east coast rappers like biggie , nas , jay-z and mobb deep , but he never opened his mouth about wu-tang because they would lyrically destroy him.this is one of the best albums from 95 right behind gza 's liquid swords and mobb deep 's the infamous
0	kate bush 's second album , `` lionheart '' , may be the weakest in her catalog . its clear bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing `` the kick inside part two '' , and instead reaches in a number of different directions , some successful , some less so . musically , the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ( `` in search of peter pan '' , `` in the warm room '' ) , a more pop structure ( `` wow '' ) , rhythmic shifts ( `` do n't put your foot on the heartbrake '' ) an almost shuffle ( `` fullhouse '' ) and a gret rock song ( `` hammer horror '' ) . lyrically , bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ( `` symphony in blue '' ) and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ( `` kashka from baghdad '' ) . the problem is that it does n't hang together well to my mind -- admittedly , my rating for the album is in many ways relative to bush 's other work , no album with the absolutelyu amazing `` kashka from baghdad '' can be all that bad , and certainly `` symphony in blue '' is strong enough to stop you in your tracks , but the album just does n't work for me . for early bush , try her debut ( `` the kick inside '' ) or the stunning `` never for ever ''
1	the progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from poland . these guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years . so what do we get for our money you ask , a band comprising of well-schooled musicians , incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song . there are a few scatterings of influences that are n't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album , namely dream theater , pink floyd , porcupine tree , genesis and anathema . the vocals are clean without a trace of an accent , however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music . the guitar work is outstanding and david gilmour from pink floyd is a strong reference point here . the rhythm section is outstanding ; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering . if you want to start 2007 on a good note then riverside is a worthy investment for sure .
0	i love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable . gim me earth or sunno ) ) ) anyday
0	do n't waste your money . this album is cheesy , sounds like a million other pop rock songs , and is nothing compared to their earlier work . with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals , all i have to say is : they need the old lead singer back ! the guitar work is ok , but the classic .38 special sound has definitely been lost
0	if you are short on money , do not buy this c.d . you will regret it . however if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good , especially the dr . evil `` just the two of us '' . really this is not a good album , as side two is rubbish . i still have n't listened to it all the way throug
0	no strings attached is to my memory one of the worst albums ever made.no one listens to the stupid boy bands anymore.this piece of c @ # p does not sell even a thousand copies today unless the previous reviewer is buying up all the million copies himself.dont buy any album from n stync or the equally horrible justin timberlake.get any beatles album instead
1	in 1976 , my fair lady returned to broadway , in a revival touted as the `` 20th anniversary '' production . perhaps most famously , this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called christine andreas ... at long last , this much sought-after cast album gets its cd premiere . christine andreas is one of the best eliza 's ever captured on disc , and ian richardson 's performance as beleaguered tutor higgins is full of wit and humour . george rose ( in a tony-winning turn as eliza 's dustman father ) is very enjoyable in his main numbers `` with a little bit of luck '' and `` get me to the church on time '' . jerry lanning also makes for a fine freddy , with the winsome `` on the street where you live '' . this recording also features the `` embassy waltz '' sequence , which was never included on the obc , and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the olc . the production itself heavily recreated the original production , complete with oliver smith 's sets and cecil beaton 's costumes . hanya holm 's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain crandall diehl . christine andreas picked up a theatre world award for her breakthrough performance . the show opened at the st. james theatre on march 25th 1976 , but later moved to the lunt-fontanne theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances . the following year , andreas returned to broadway in another important revival , the 1978 production of `` oklahoma ! '' in which she made a thrilling laurey ( cast album available on rca ) ; before cememting her position as broadway 's ingenue of choice , with the role of frankie frayne in the 1983 revival of `` on your toes '' ( cast album available on jay/ter ) . more recently , she played marguerite st. just , in the original company of frank wildhorn 's flawed `` scarlet pimpernel '' ( cast album available on atlantic ) . i heartily recommend this particular my fair lady
1	fluke 's latest album had been long in coming , and plagued with issues ( word on the grapevine is one of the trend-setting trio left some point during production ) . still , years after their masterpiece risotto , fluke has returned intact and delivered another album , the oddly titled puppy . puppy is for the most part a dark album . it 's clearly the evolution of the track absurd ( off risotto ) and its particular taste of big beat techno , with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals . the sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in prodigy 's fat of the land or at a nine inch nails concert . the opening snapshot shows this most evidently . the album takes up a rave feel with the tracks another kind of blues ( a remix of the stellar number zion featured in the matrix reloaded and its soundtrack ) and hang tough , which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial grooves . ykk is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big-budget spy or action flick , while expo is a sweeping and epic song . blue sky is as close to an uplifting number you 'll find on the cd , with a full choir used in the song 's chorus . compared to risotto , puppy inevitably comes up short . like bt 's emotional technology , puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album to a complete and utter masterpiece ( puppy to risotto , emotional technology to movement in still life ) . and let 's face it : it 's hard to surpass yourself when release an album that 's nigh-perfect . still , i was n't sure what to expect with puppy and i found myself pleasantly surprised . it 's darker and meaner , but it 's an overall rock-solid album , and fans of the grittier side of fluke ( absurd , atom bomb ) will likely be pleased with puppy
0	i love running to the marine corps cadence cds . volumes 1 and 2 are very good . volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral . when running vols 1 2 are better synched for continuous running . the transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me . others do n't seem to agree and i still run to this cd ; i 'd buy 1 and 2 first if you do n't have them
1	the best r band ever ! ! ! i know some will disagree with me , but this is the band that really rock my boat . i mean , they were awesome and it was n't forced or fake . the rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down . i am in the process of getting all their cds , but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music
1	link this cd of great melodies with `` the best of the browns ( 1954-1967 ) . you 'll not regreat the quality . such easy listening . this group is simply the best . i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book `` looking back to see , a country music memoir . '' it 's a well written ( and interesting ) cover of the the history of the browns
0	the cat carol is the most depressing christmas song i have ever heard . not to ruin the ending for you but the cat dies ! did n't exactly put me in the holiday spirit
1	relationships and drug use are major themes . this album starts off with two absolute killer tunes , lets down some but has a joy thoughout . i ca n't believe this is going to be his only album ... ..what a shame . from someone who has been listening to rock for a long time , i tell ya , this is a blast . pure fun . something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love ... ..mostly rather quickly paced . one of my favorite albums of the 90s . more people should listen
0	as a huge counting crows fan , i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them ... right up until the time that i listened to the cd . it is nearly impossible to get through . the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke . i rated it one star because there 's no `` 0 star '' option . if you have any intentions of buying this cd , find a website where you can preview it first , and thank me later
1	i received `` aerial '' last december , and it still amazes me . the music soars and sweeps , carrying the listener along on its wings . it is a work of genius , and those who are long-time kate bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive ! this two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences , in my opinion . the first disc , `` a sea of honey '' is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces , first of which is `` king of the mountain , '' probably the most `` commercially appealing '' song on the album . `` king of the mountain '' sucks the listener in with deep , murky tones and kate 's voice easing into the song softly , building in intensity as the song progresses . `` king of the mountain '' is followed by songs like `` pi '' ( who else but kate bush could make the derivation of pi sound so sexy ? ) and `` bertie , '' a lovely elizabethan paean to her young son . then there are emotionally raw songs like `` mrs. bartolozzi '' and `` a coral room , '' the latter of which is about kate 's late mother . the reclusive ms. bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in `` how to be invisible , '' and sings in reference to joan of arc in `` joanni . '' after being captivated by songs about famous people , and more down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs , the listener comes to the second disc , titled `` a sky of honey . '' this is , in my opinion , the piï¿½ce de rï¿½sistance of `` aerial . '' this disc is a continuous journey of sound , taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by -- among other things -- the sounds of birds , the sound of her child 's voice , and kate bush 's silky voice singing in italian . the disc is almost indescribably beautiful , in my opinion . i love the way `` a sky of honey '' takes me out of myself when i hear it . i feel like i am flying at points ; becoming one with the soaring birds . my personal favorite on `` a sky of honey '' is `` nocturn , '' a surreal nighttime romp on the beach , accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of kate bush 's voice . the disc 's final ( and title ) track `` aerial '' is a forceful climax to the sonic journey , and ends with bush singing : `` i want to be up on the roof i 've got ta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun '' it is as though kate bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip . what an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is ! to kate bush fans , i can not recommend this album highly enough . true , it was a very long wait for this new cd , but , ms. bush has rewarded her fans duly ; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph ! if you are a kate bush devotee , you will not be disappointed ! and , if you are new to kate bush , `` aerial '' will be a great introduction to her genius . kate bush is like no other artist i can name . her voice is incredibly versatile ; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee , a temptress or a child . and , so far in her career , it kate bush 's voice gets better with the passing of time . like a fine wine , one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly . `` aerial '' is well , well worth listening to , and words alone can not suffice to explain what a work of art it is .
0	i got this cd after seeing what i remembered as a decent video on fuse tv . maybe i was half-asleep , because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats , i ca n't even remember or recognize which song it was . this album is ultimately forgettable -- better off listening to any jimmy eat world cd again and again , which is actually an enjoyable experience
1	another hot release , top 5 in 2005 so far . no one even metions track 7 produced by one and only el-producto and track 8 by belief . hot cd recommend to those who do n't listin to bull
0	this is definitely not a bad collection , but there are so many better ones out there , that this should not be your first choice . the song sweet emotion has been completely destroyed on this album . the entire bass intro has been cut out , and the song starts about an entire minute into it . there really is no reason to do this , as even on the radio , they play the entire thing , as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long . the song starts at a terrible place too . it sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song , then just stuck it on the cd that way . again , not a terrible compilation , but definitely not a good first choice
0	this album was released in 1999 . and now , seven years later , this album does not even matter . britney spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child . great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity , innovation , creativity , and ability to transcend cultures and generations . great music stirs something inside the listener , and matters to the person who created it . britney spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things . it saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally . and yet , the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades , even - after their release . music like this , britney spears and her peers , disappears into the folds of time . it does not matter .
0	this has got to be the worst pile of trash i ever heard , right now i cant think of anything worse then this . the same ol trash bling and girls . and if you got jd and bow wow on your album at the same time , its gon na be wack . and do these n***** even know what franchise mean ? what does that word have to do with their name ? i 'll just start a click called ham cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter
1	i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns -- instruments bound to the overtone series . on the `` natural '' or `` hand '' horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the `` stopped '' notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored `` open '' pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment -- they are all `` open '' notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two `` closed '' notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to `` correct '' beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .
1	i consider this to be one of the finest live coltrane recordings out there . it was also one of the first coltrane albums i picked up , and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like live at the village vanguard again and live in japan . this is much more similar to afro blue impressions which is another overlooked release . by this point in time , trane had already done some work with eric dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on a love supreme just one year later . one of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is because elvin jones is replaced by roy haynes , while jones was serving some jail time . the absence of jones is noticeable but i still think this is worthy of five stars . the first 3 tracks are from the newport jazz festival and in addition to haynes and trane , we have the remaining quartet members , mccoy tyner ( piano ) and jimmy garrison ( bass ) . tyner is especially amazing on 'my favorite things ' which i consider the best version of that piece in trane 's entire catalogue . i consider it to be a bridge to some of his later recordings . this is because we get trane 's two sides . first of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first part of the piece . however , the song still goes on for 17 minutes and the interplay between tyner and haynes for much of it is amazing . rounding out the performance is billy eckstine 's 'i want to talk about you ' with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple of trane 's technique , followed by a 15 minute version of 'impressions . ' again we hear trane 's two sides . on one hand we hear where he is coming from . which is the confines of other jazz gods like miles davis and thelonius monk . on the the other hand we can see where he is going , which is a much more abstract/free-jazz approach . once you can begin to understand trane 's more abstract side , you will find later recordings less challenging , such as interstellar space , meditations , or a love supreme . in addition to the three newport recordings , there is an extra track from november of 1961 from the village vanguard . 'chasin ' another trane ' is played by haynes and trane as well as dolphy on alto sax and reggie workman on bass . the presence of dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant-garde piece on the record , almost reminiscent of early ornette coleman . coltrane really cooks on this record , and the sound quality is also pretty decent . it 's not as crystal clear as his carnegie hall concert with monk , but nevertheless , i consider it a great place to start for trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his later music .
0	i like funny rappers who have some talent at least . i do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all . and even the people that i know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they do n't like it at all by the third time . truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke . avoid this one
1	i just want to put it out there ... audra mcdonald is an absolute genious . everything she touches turns to gold , and i just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record . this may not be the audra that we are used to , but if you listen closely she 's near by . so this cd is a little less difficult vocally . so what ? my favorite quality of ms. mcdonald 's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing . she could record twinkle twinkle little star and i would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story . so if you buy this cd , listen to it more than once . let it grow on you . let audra do her thang children . let her do her thang .
0	method : take a monster , genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago , borrow the voicings , polyrhythms and sound effects , rearrange them to slightly ( but not *that* ) different tunes , crib the album art ( cheesy then ; cheesier now ) and re-release . the point ? well , to the man , it 's obvious . there 's one born every minute . but for genuine , discerning afficionados of electronica ? search me . like a good souffle , it was better the first time . indeed , inventing oxygene parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch . and guess what turned out to be jarre 's next project ? whoops ! writer 's block , perchance ? olly buxto
1	of course , no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could . his trumpet can only be described as hot , and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air . this man 's music has life in it . unfortunately , the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work , and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series . ken burns ' collection here is more versatile , but just not as lively as dizzy 's music can be . proceed with caution
0	the firm ( a conglomerate consisting of nas , az , foxy brown and the relative unknown nature ( who took the place of original member cormega after a heated dispute ) ) ... came up with the `` brilliant idea '' to collaborate on a full album ... after the release of `` affirmative action '' from nas ' it was written album . after enlisting the assistance of dr. dre 's aftermath records and production by the infamous trackmasters , the firm 's album is subpar to say the least ... it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy ... . '' hardcore '' for example . however , i will admit , there are some shining moments by all four members ... .and some half decent production ... .i.e . `` phone tap '' ... '' f**k somebody else '' ( lyrics are forgettable since foxy is doing what she does best on the mic ... talking about sex and its many forms ... .i think you might be able to masterbate to this one ... lol ) . i will give this a decent try but i ca n't go no further than that . i will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
0	i understand why the beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck . they only made about two decent songs in their `` hey jude '' a pretty song , and `` ballad of john and yoko '' . the sixties was a horrible decade of rock music . i would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties , which one of them is neil young 's `` down by the river '' . i have listened to the beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was . they were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time . this one album is definately not the album to buy at all unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music . here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded . if you want good music , i recommend go buy albums from foreigner , dire straits , green day , guns n ' roses , and metallica insted . do n't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs
1	this is a wonderful , fun and soothing cd ! it will relax children and parents will enjoy it even after the 100th listen ! ! my husband is a musician and he loves both of the dan zanes cds we have . this will now be a gift i give to all my friends and family when they have a baby
1	i 'll begin by saying this is n't the only `` ministry of sound chillout sessions '' i 've heard , in fact i love the mos brand , so i can honestly say that every single compilation has it 's on flavour , from the `` clubber 's guide to '' to `` the annual ( spring/ summer/ annual ) '' which means , the previous and next instalments do n't necesarily match this review . with that being said : this particular compilation has a very elegant/ european/ underground feel to it . it 's indie electronica and some rock-gone-acid-jazz , and of course , it would n't be european without some house music . it 's fascinating that in the middle of an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly . yes , it 's that type of record . it 's not pop , it 's not a 'greatest hits ' mash-up and it 's definately not boring . i remember the first time i heard it ( i was working graveyard shifts at that time ) i 'd listen to the first cd and it 'd make me fall sound asleep after the first half . it 's not a bad thing , it 's just very relaxing , very soothing to the soul ( specially the lior song `` this old love '' , which helped me get through a rather painful breakup ) overall , it 's that kind of session . it makes you think , it makes you apreciate it , it 's a 'life soundtrack ' from track 1 of the second disc ( `` we all live and die '' from kinda new ) giving you a morning starter to the soothing track `` run ( jacknife lee remix ) '' on the first disc which invites you to the promised dreamland . nothing you 'd expect from a regular mos compilation , everything you 'd expect from a really good chillout compilation . a must for any true chillout junkie
0	remember the days when we were punks and we 'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders ? they held up to 4 minutes of music ! count 'em , 4 minutes ! then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him , including myself . he was quite the singer . when i was a young kid though , the only form of music we had were the concerts . i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert , quite an amazing virtuoso , and johann strauss jr. conducting his orchestra , those were the days . then they came out with those things called grammophones , which were even more modern , if it was even possible . but it was , because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to , lazy kids . i mean , you did n't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones . and what 's this , 1 hour , a full 60 minutes of music , on 1 record ? pshaw ! 4 minutes of music was all i needed , and i was still pooped out even after that . in my day , it was bed at 4 p.m. , breakfast at 2 a.m. , then off to the mines . we did n't have 60 minutes of free time . i have no idea what form of music they have now . appearently , they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph . now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods ( ? ) and mp3 , mp4 players , whatever they 're called , listening to that `` hip-hop '' tomfoolery of theirs . you ca n't even call it music , it 's just noise . well , got ta get ready for bed now , it 's almost 3:45
0	greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , `` tha crossroads '' , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of `` f- tha police '' , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya
1	i used to be a bigger fan of joe satriani than steve vai about 10 years ago . now i quickly get bored of new satriani albums , but vai 's music just moves me . lotus feet for example , wow , words can not describe what that song does to me . thanks steve
1	hands down , a 5 star , two thumbs up , classic joint . after it dropped , puba reigned supreeeme . disregard the amazon reviewer , there are no `` gaffes '' in this one , period ... these guys were true to their beliefs . they were n't packaging a product for `` pop '' consumption , they were telling a generation what they thought . check it out and the music will speak for itself . the best track in my opinion was `` wake up '' , but the whole album was great . as someone else mentioned , fast tracks put it in the 90 's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever .

1	this album was by far the bands most daring ablum . they went away from the classic inxs sound that made them superstars ( kick , x ) and instead updated their sound to fit the time . like a previous reviewer noted , this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the us , and unfortunately , caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part . its sad too , cuz there are many solid tracks , inlcuding heaven sent ( my favorite ) , not enough time , baby dont cry and beautiful girl . i have recently become a big fan of inxs and have purchased all of their albums . i like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums . i recommend `` welcome '' to any inxs fan and any other fan of great music
1	good cd , but where is his recent hit `` i wan na feel that way again '' and his classic hit `` walkin ' to jeruselum ''
0	after breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group chicago , traitor cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker . it 's coincidental that the first track is titled `` big mistake '' , as if traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make . i bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money , and after i had listened to the album once , i made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly . what else is here ? oh , you have the `` karate kid ii '' ballad `` glory of love '' , a tune so nauseating it 's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon , and go straight from the original `` karate kid '' to `` iii '' and `` next '' whenever i do my yearly film marathon . i just pretend the second film never existed . it also has the semi-smash `` next time i fall '' , where traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist amy grant . in short , if you a ) thought cetera 's leaving chicago was a great decision , or b ) like your music pointless and nauseating , by all means get this album . if you want music with real heart and soul , just go buy some chicago . you 'll be glad you did
1	i am a big ambrosia fan and i love `` biggest part of me '' , `` you 're the only woman '' , `` how much i feel '' and the newer track `` i just ca n't let go '' . however , i wish this cd contained all of their billboard hot 100 hits . the cd is missing their cover of `` magical mystery tour '' ( # 39 ) and `` how can you love me '' ( # 86 ) . for the casual listener , this cd is perfect . for the chart hit completionists out there , it misses a couple songs . i bought this cd used for $ 1.99 , which was a huge bargain for the songs included . for that price , i can certainly try to download the missing tracks
0	as for many of these kind of unknown groups , the music in the album is useless . in the meaning that this music has no use . it is not relaxing . it is not for contemplation . it is not spiritual . it is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of `` ambient '' . but ambient music is music . this is crap . well differently from two a.d. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold , because people is n't stupid . two a.d. is light years away from this crap . do n't waste your money . listen the the samples by yourself to grab what i mean . sergi
0	who could like a band like the rolling stones ? they are not the world 's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but start me up and shattered . their new album is the most horrible cd i have ever heard . stay far away from that cd . get anything from the stones that contains start me up or shattered insted .
0	do you love `` on eagles wings '' ? if the answer is yes , then do you know the words to panis angelicus ? the answer is probably `` no . '' i do n't blame you for liking this cd . the problem is that it is n't catholic and it is n't classic . you should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years . if you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass , start with sacred songs by bocelli , or simply baroque by yo yo ma
1	pablo is definitely the babe ruth/moses of these pieces . however , tempo , cadence , clarity , consistency and emotional projection are much better here . starker is at least the michael jordan of the bach suites . -and compared to pablo ( i heard the naxos one ) the sound quality on this disc is the right hand of god . starker is the dog 's balls ; big ones , like a great dane .
1	tears for fears was not the average 80 's pop band , even if they looked like it on the surfice . they used synthsizers , drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound . but the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at the time had the guts to sing about . tears for fears got their name from arthur janov 's primal scream therapy and they band consisted of roland orzabal and curt smith , two highschool friends from bath , england . roland was the writer of most songs during the career while they both were co-singing . some of the music may sound a little dated today ( this being released in 1983 ) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present today . the opener and title track is a great pop song and at the same time a good introduction to what is coming , it 's about children suffering without anyone noticing or caring . tears for fears trademark was mixing good pop with serious subjects and they really succeeded with that . `` mad world '' was one of the big hits and recently covered by gary jules and taken back to the charts again as the sountrack for `` donnie darko '' . the moody alternative song brings up the sad reality we 're living in , a world without rules or morals and the people suffering from it . excellent and haunting ballad . `` pale shelter '' was originally released in 1982 but failed to make it big on the charts , so the song was re-recorded , remixed and re-released and the result was a big hit even for `` pale shelter '' . the song is slow paced and distinct with guitars , synthesizers and percussion . it brings up the lack of love some children get cause of bad parenthood . `` ideas as opiates '' is almost minimalistic , it basically only feauture percussion and slow piano sound , the lyrics are also sparse . `` memories fade '' is also a stripped and melancholy song , with it 's haunting lyrics and saxophone it 's one of this album 's highlights . `` suffer them children '' is a synth laden pop song about children with problems growing up cause they 're ignored and not given too much love . watch me bleed '' got very strong lyrics `` heaven comes to he who waits/ but i know im getting nowhere/ and all the deeds of yesterday /have really helped to pave my way '' and is overall another great pop/rock song . `` change '' was one of three big hits on this album , it got a trademark marimba sound and a great hook which paved the way to the charts . the song is focusing on the destructive behavior of a loved one . `` the prisoner '' is the darkest of songs with some very strong lyrics and arrangements suited for a horror film , the lyrics are sparse and they 're almost whispered . the last song is called `` start of a breakdown '' feautures a catchy synthesizer sound and meliodic percussion . why this song was not released as single is beyond me , but it 's one of the best songs . this remastered version feauture remixed of pale shelter '' , `` mad world '' and `` change and the non-album song `` the way you are '' is present . it 's another fantastic song by the way . uptempo with great percussion arrangements . nice it was added . overall , tears for fears magnificient debut was one of the most daring and thoughtful albums of the 80 's . it 's equally intellegent and beautiful full of good lyrics and great arrangements . with this remastered version you get better sound + bonus tracks and the non album song `` the way you are '' . some of the songs may sounds a little dated today , considering all the new equipment used in today 's music , but the lyrics and subjects they brought up are just as present in today 's society . this album may get a little too personal and the lyrics get frightening when you listen closely to them at times , however if you 're a music fan that likes smart lyrics and lyrics that make sense then this is something for you . it 's a concept album and it very thoughtful and sincere . one of the greatest debuts of the 80 's , let alone albums .
1	this was one of my first albums i got . i got it because of 'paradise city ' but got adapted quickly to 'welcome to the jungle ' and rest . there were only few more metal/rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens : maiden 's 'powerslave ' , megadeth 'rust in peace ' and suicidal tendencies 'lights ... camera ... revolution '
1	yeah , johnny must 've been drinking heavily during this recording . it 's evident in his slurred lyrics ... it 's raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted , although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed . but all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d. -- -- johnny winter really becomes the archetypal bluesman on this c.d . his guitar work is quite sparse , no long solos on this one but , nevertheless , the feel on this album is wonderful . i have to say this also..johnny must 've been very , very brave to release this album back in 1977 . that was a very bad year for the blues , appalling infact ... disco music was king . alot of bluesmen , like johnny guitar watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor . johnny might 've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like edgar was doing . instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and i have to admire the determination and resolve of johnny winter . very few would 've stayed faithful to the blues . the last track with muddy waters ..walking thru the park ... captures johnny in his element . he was so happy back then and it filters over into the song itself . i remember seeing them both do this song live at the capitol radio festival , alexander palace , london/england in july 1977 . never again to be repeated , sadly
1	back in the 70 's and 80 's , i listened to a really great radio station , wsgs in hazard , kentucky . from my home in flat gap , virginia , and anywhere in the region , it was well known that if you wanted real country music , you simply had to turn on wsgs . 100,000 watts of pure , monophonic country music . i 'm not talking about the big hats of nashville , or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days . no , it was the real thing , including local and regional bluegrass , gospel , hiccup preachers , loretta lynn , lefty frizzel , merle haggard , bill monroe , grandpa jones , and countless others . when i listen to this pattly loveless release , i think she must have been listening too . it sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old wsgs . only better , because patty is from our time , and seems to have that old time , mountain shout-it-out style much like many of those who came before . she reminds me a bit of wilma lee cooper . what a voice ! if you have never heard of these early country artists , and you like the way patty does it up here , it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from . this is the real thing
1	this album is simply one of the coolest things around , and when i listened to it , it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place ' kind of method . what this basically is , are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly indian/middle eastern/oriental festivals ; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice . you get indian gamelan , mussette accordion , vocal choruses , foreign tongue talking , and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track , and then some . it 's very trippy , and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason . get this for your own good
0	there is not much i can add to these reviews here . just like me , a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters . why would such an abomination happen ? suge knight is trying to milk the pac legacy until it is bone dry . well at least he has done something right if you ask me . it sucks that this is how we are forced to remember tupac shakur , over tracks chopped up into this . die hard pac fans wo n't even like this , if they have n't heard it already . i 'm so waiting for a remix album of `` the chronic '' and `` doggystyle '' . if suge knight was smart you would reissue tha dogg pound 's `` dogg food '' on dual disc , because that is the only reason why i do n't have that album yet .
0	this album is okay not their best . a few songs are good other than that this album is fair.purcahse it with your money intelligently ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	ana carolina is a good singer and seu jorge is a cult culture figure here in brazil , but this cd is a mistake . do not spend money on this
1	i must agree with the comments made by other reviewers . this album is great . nancy wilson 's voice on this album is unlike anything i have ever heard . you ca n't honestly say you 're a fan of jazz if you do n't own this
1	juice newton is one of the best counry-pop singers of all times . a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs . my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning , the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartache after all these years , her work is unforgettable , catchy and full of energy and vibe
1	it is good for old eric gale fans to be able to purchase this cd . it will bring back many memories . it will also remind you of how great a guitar player he was . i am grateful that i 've had a chance to own many recordings that he has played on . pay close attention to she is my lady and morning glory . this is a must have cd . jaye price beltsville , md .
0	let me first say this , roots is basically paul simon 's graceland , except nu-metalized . these guys went to south america , cut a couple of terrible tracks with `` natives '' ? , then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure . this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics , excessive `` guesting '' of other crappy artist , bad guitar , bad sitar ( ! ) , and the inclusion of anything to do with korn , all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and rambo style striped face paint . the biggest waste of time , money , and matter . its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using . a real bummer .
1	this cd is perfect for driving . the downtempo/beat driven ambient feel and overall togetherness of this cd is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening . overall very pleased with mr. schnauss ' contribution to the genre . highly reccomende
0	ac/dc is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time , but they are not growing as musicians . sure , they can rock like they used too , but they seem to be out of ideas . the well is dry . put out a anthology already ! ! ! at least my favorite band deep purple keep coming up with good stuff , and with imagination ! the fact that purple 's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber . anyway , better luck next time angus co . stiff upper lip ~ ac/dc : 2 stars
1	too bad this group supported by keith sweat did n't go any further . i bought it for one song , but the whole cd is great for listening . lyrics contain songs about love and such , and i like they way speak about it . it gives you something to look forward to .
1	3rd force 's new cd `` force field '' is their first new cd in a few years . the track `` revelation of the heart '' sets the tone for this wonderful recording . a must have to add to your collection
1	my roomate from two years ago had a cd of doris ; and i must admit , at first , i was a little skeptical . but soon i became stunned by her vocal prowess and the emotional heart juice that she brought to these classic songs . plus , you should see her in a football uniform ! man can she catch the pigskin
1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties . they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable . but , there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste . my fave song is 'is it for me ' . it is hard to classify them though . it sort of deep and meaningful ( at most times ) pop rock . other good tracks include walk on the ocean , pray your gods and i will not take ... etc . i regard this album and 'dulcinea ' as their two best albums
1	which i suppose i 'm not allowed to say , what with the worldwide phenomenon that was songs from the big chair . but i think it 's right . roland took the opportunity following the breakup with curt to make an aggressively postmodern record , and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on the hurting always suggested . indeed , this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time ; as a previous reviewer noted , `` goodnight song '' has what has since become a familiar aor sound . i call it the first `` coldplay '' song , and it 's fair to suggest that band would never exist without tears for fears . roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here . on songs and seeds , 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc , a sense of opening , progression , and completion ; the 10 songs here have room to breathe , vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with `` goodnight '' . as both roland and curt have matured , they have also mellowed . the anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone . and their latest album , everybody loves a happy ending , has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing . but cds do n't age , so pick this sucker up . it really does n't get much better
0	this recording is not great company . i 'm really confused : is it a broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording ? and if so , did this rubbish actually make it to the broadway stage ? i feel for the people that saw it , and were expecting the rich full melodies that sondheim produced for this show . the musical director for this abomination should be called a mutilation director , because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show . so the only advice i give to future musical directors that want to revive and revamp a show : if it 's not broke , please , please , please do n't try and fix it ! some things are just perfect the way they are . do n't buy this cd . i did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use
0	most people seem to like the soundtrack from '' glory '' , but this fact does not necessarily make '' glory '' a great , or even good soundtrack ... most people also like the food served atmacdonald 's , but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers ... it is something to put in one 's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry ... the same might be said regarding '' glory '' ... if one 's tastes run to choir music , almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here ... as for the themes , they are commonplace variations , often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer , or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores , so , all in all , the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap , '' homestyle '' diner ... the film , on the other hand , was well done , and , apparently , from reading many of the other reviews here , the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself , rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.horner has written a lot of really , really beautiful and original scores , but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness ... so , in sum , we are left with a very popular film , provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
1	this is one of his older cds , but one of my favorites . the music is smooth and wonderful to listen to . great cd after a long day or to play on a special night
0	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice , albeit a little underpowered , but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture . there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties . in fact , i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts . once again , sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art
0	this cd shocked me . at first i was listening and enjoying the beats on every track . but then listening to the actual content of each song , b*tch this and h*e that . come on , as a young female , how am i supposed to bump this in my car ? every single song on the cd is disrespectful . you know what really makes me mad , this is what 's supposed to be hot , popular . what kind of message is this sending to our young black men ? our young women ? i would not recommend this for any one , especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman .
1	really enjoyed hearing all of them again . there is some great talent on here . i hope they all get their own opportunities ! i do think in some cases there are some better songs to show off these great singers voices .
1	this album marked a return of sorts to the old trademark isley brothers sound , and it 's off the hook.jam and terry , steve huff , rafeal saddiq , kelly and angela winbush all took their turns puttin ' it down , and that 's exactly what they did.from the time move your body kicks in until the very end this album is absolutely slammin'.highlights in my opinion are you desreve better , just like this , warm summer night and move your body.but the absolute highlight and ( in my opinion ) one of the most slept on songs of all times is the title cut eternal.that is one of my top ten isley brothers favorites of all times.the song kind of reminds me of make me say it again , and earnie showed all the way out on the guitar solo on that song.contagious even had a bit of the isleys sound and probably introduced them to a whole new audience.as a whole , i am extremely fond of this album
1	the afro-eurasian eclipse is a groundbreaking suite , full of intriguing new sounds and grooves . ellington did n't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years ; instead , his compositions became more and more original and exciting . this suite has rocking , swinging , waltzing grooves that , though seemingly disparate , work together and illustrate the theme stated in the duke 's spoken introduction to the suite : to show that `` the whole world is going oriental , and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity ... not even the orientals . '' duke does n't leave his standbys behind , though . the phenomenal playing of ashby , carney , jones , and the rest of the orchestra keeps the afro-eurasian eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity , even when playing to new grooves , melded with african , asian , and australian rhythm and sound . on a personal note , this is one of my favorite cds . aside from the remarkable music , it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction , at the beginning of the `` chinoiserie '' track . audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the cd , especially one with a single focus , like this one .
0	aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time . they only made 3 decent songs in same old song and dance , seasons of wither , and janies got a gun . rest of the songs just stink explosively . avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band , steven tyler screams , he ca n't sing at all ? ? ? this is music for drug addicts
0	once `` the very best of 10cc '' was released in 1997 , it was the collection to have . that collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc 's career , ending with the godley and creme hit `` cry . '' so why would this cd be released , especially since the only thing it offers over the prior cd is `` channel swimmer '' and `` do n't hang up ? '' buy the cd `` how dare you '' and `` the very best of 10cc '' and you will have three times the music you have on this cd for only twice the price . an unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio
1	if you want a feel good , come home from work and forget your day cd you found it her
0	these guys are not artists . they are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene . it 's like a few monkeys build a house , and all the other monkeys rave about it , but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat ... whatever that means . i am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio . buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere .
0	i was disappointed with the album as a whole . when i heard the song `` drink to me babe , then '' , i thought it was great and sounded like the shins . the rest of the album was boring lyrically
0	of the dozen tracks featured here , chances are the typical listener will only recognize four : `` signs , '' `` sweet city woman , '' `` one fine morning '' and `` gim me dat ding '' - and the last-named is out of sequence , having come out more than a year before the others . the star of this show is lighthouse 's `` one fine morning , '' and rhino must be praised for offering up the full ( lp ) version rather than the 45-rpm edit , which was about two minutes shorter . it 's a shame , in a way , that this song had lyrics ; had it been an instrumental , it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on `` music from nfl films '' - it had that quality about it . as for the other eight offerings : if they wanted to pick some obscure stuff , why did n't they go all the way and throw in dusk 's `` treat me like a good piece of candy ?
1	tim mcgraw does it again . it is a great album with some really great songs . a must have
1	try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums . let me give you one ground rule though : it has to be from a band that put out at least five albums ( so no stone roses , sugar , verve or jane 's addiction , e.g. ) . here are some of mine , off the top of my head : led zeppelin i , in the court of the crimson king , days of future passed , the doors , boy ( u2 ) , c.s.n. , ca n't buy a thrill ( steely dan ) , ten ( pearl jam ) , murmur ( rem ) . i 'm sure there are a number of others that i 'm forgetting . oh yeah , one more : the incredible `` ferment , '' by catherine wheel . the harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by rob dickinson and brian futter , the compelling rhythms generated by dave hawes ( bass ) and neil sims ( percussion ) , it just all works , and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary `` nowhere '' by ride ( not quite as great as `` loveless '' by my bloody valentine ) . unfortunately , c.w . never quite matched the power of `` ferment '' with their subsequent releases . the best song on the album is `` black metallic '' ( `` it 's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic '' ) which soars up to the sky , floats in the wind , lands , and soars again . clearly , `` black metallic '' clocks in as the band 's `` stairway to heaven . '' the second best song on `` ferment '' is . . . well that 's where it gets tricky , and demostrates how great this album is . there are no weak or even average songs , and i could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to `` black metallic . '' put a gun to my head and i would have to go with `` shallow '' or maybe `` tumbledown '' or perhaps , if i 'm in a more pop oriented mood , the danceable `` i want to touch you . '' although , last night , as i was listening to the album in preparation for this review , i thought of how strongly it closes with the trio `` '' bill and ben , '' `` salt '' and the uplifting `` balloon '' ( `` ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon '' ) . a wonderful album . perhaps not in my top ten , but definitely in my top twenty ( tied with the aforementioned `` nowhere '' )
0	this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now . why ca n't people my age stop copying the past ? be original . that 's it . this style is well worn out .
0	look i really despise bush . he 's an idiot . and i know people are gon na have different opinions on that . but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree . seriously the music is really not good . however if you do buy it make sure you watch the dvd eh ? its got a great will farrel skit on it . 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here ( ie no w by the ministry ) thats all
0	i love ray charles when ray 's doing ray . this was terrible . ray was out of tune , out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous . i 'm sorry ray , i love you . it 's a shame this had to be one of your last cd 's
0	i loved her first album but this one is the same old same old rehashed time and time again she has reached her limits i 'm afriad
0	this never should 've been pressed . they should 've taken the mix and thrown it out . do not buy ! !
1	all-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find , and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments , here 's your chance for total immersion . all the songs on this compilation are from rounder records albums released 1976-1998 , by artists with familiar names like alison krauss and tony rice , and others you may never have heard of . all are first rate , foot stompin ' renditions of bluegrass traditionals , with a few great originals -- bill monroe 's `` bluegrass breakdown '' and earl scruggs ' `` foggy mountain chimes . '' best known for most listeners is a rousing version of `` orange blossom special '' by the johnson mountain boys . if you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin ' at breakneck speed , this cd will keep you smilin ' through many , many replays
0	this collection of 15 great hits of nicola di bari in spanish is missing one of his most ( if not the most ) important and popular song : `` lisa de los ojos azules '' . i would n't buy this cd without that song
1	miss saigon is my favorite all-time musical ! i was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind lea salonga is and always will be kim ! but i was pleasantly surprised . joanna ampil as kim holds her own . while she does n't have the vocal range of lea , she has a beautiful , crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of kim . she expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love , pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own . the rest of the cast is superb ( especially the amazing ruthie henshall as ellen ) but make no mistake , this show belongs to ampil ! i also fell in love with some of the material left out of the lcr . there a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story . `` back in town '' stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies . anyone who has fallen in love with the story of `` miss saigon '' will appreciate these added gems ! this cast recording is definitely worth a listen !
1	i bought this cd on a whim after i heard joaquin phoenix was directing their `` tired of being sorry '' video . whoa ! i was addicted ! i could n't stop listening to it ... i had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so i could stop carrying it back and forth . great driving music ! the songs are catchy and have a great beat ... i have n't heard anything this good in a long while . i had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of scott thomas ' ... .more on the acoustic/indie side , but awesome ! i highly recommend lovers thieves ( cdbaby.com ) my faves from ringside are `` struggle '' , `` trixie '' , and `` dreamboat 730 '' . you will not be disappointed
1	loreena has a pure talent for weaving melody music and words together . her song the highwayman is absolutely astounding to be able to put the old poem into music melody and verse is quite amazing
1	this is the first cd i 've bought in the liquid mind series , but after hearing this one , i 'll buy more . the music is calming and soothing ; great to fall asleep by which i often do . it lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation , letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day . it makes me think of floating on a cloud . i would highly recommend this cd for anyone with a busy , stressed-out life .
0	while the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded , there are way too many birds around . the cd describes their sound as distant and faint , but that 's far from accurate . the parts of the cd where all you hear is the stream alone do n't add up to more than 10 minutes , and never last more than a minute . for the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds , rather close and sometimes very loud . buyer beware : the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all ! very misleading
1	those who liked suede may be looking for more of the same from the tears , but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from brett , and the familiar wailing of bernard 's guitar , this marks a watershed in their repertoire . the most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits ' ( much more radio-friendly , and why not ? ) . it 's also a more mellow sound than suede ( there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the tears concert i attended ) . another important difference is the guitar work , with bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since reeves gabrels and tin machine . among the better songs are apollo 13 , brave new century , refugees and co-star . though brett and bernard are capable of better , this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised suede-heads , and i recommend you turn it up loud
0	for starters i love bun b and pimp c and ugk and all that but the thing that kills it is lil jon yelling `` gansta grizzel '' like 10 times in every track . i love lil jon too , but they coulda done without it . also they just rappin over other peps beats , it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal . but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record , not a mixed tape , or nothin like that , but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks , but not their own beats , and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks . just keepin it real . i wouldnt spend the money , id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd , or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up
0	another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought , over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time . did i mention over the top ? let 's face it , queen was a group of crypto-fascists , working hard to put a human face on thatcherism . ghastly stuff . k .
0	not the type of music i had envisioned ... much slower than i was hoping for .
1	this is a cd that everyone should have ! there are four great voices and they do country music the way it should be ! lorrie morgan is the best and i like everything on this ! ! buy it and enjoy ! chery
0	i hate saying this as a huge good charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money . their first album is one of my top five albums of all time , but this one sucks . the songs are all dance pop synthesized junk . no real guitars , no messages to any of the songs , no nothing . i dont know if joel is just too busy running around town with nicole richie or what but they skipped out on this album . the only redeaming song is the river , on which they colaberated with m shadows and synester gates of avenged sevenfold . i hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one , just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be .
0	having been a casual fan of stax records for a few years ; i decided earlier this year that i should go all out and splurge on this 9-cd box set . big mistake . i have many , many complaints about this set ; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess . it misses many key b-sides such as otis redding 's `` hard to handle '' and booker t the mg 's `` tic tac toe '' ; and does n't even include every a-side the label released , despite the title of the compilation ( where are the sides that hoyt johnson released for the label ? ) . the linear notes by steve greenberg ( the man who gave us that phony `` soul queen '' joss stone ; and the headache-inducing baha men ) are horrible , mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and/or songs rather than the stories behind them . and within the sections for each disc in the booklet ; they entries are n't actually arranged in any particular order ( least of all the order of the tracks on the cds , that would make too much sense ) . and there should 've been more photos , too . add to this the set 's main problem : the music . the fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame . seriously . `` why did you buy it , then ? '' i hear you say . well ; the stax songs i was familiar with ( such as `` green onions '' ; `` b-a-b-y '' ; `` you do n't miss your water '' ; `` ( sittin ' on ) the dock of the bay '' ; `` soul man '' ; `` born under a bad sign '' etc ) are all great songs . `` well , why do n't you like this set then '' you 're thinking . answer : because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs . if you think i 'm being harsh on these songs , i 'm not ; i can appreciate songs like wendy rene 's `` bar-b-q '' and the memphis nomad 's `` do n't pass your judgement '' ; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers , most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad . basically , if you really like a stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist ; if your looking for a sampler of stax 's best songs , then go and buy the 4-cd stax story ; do n't bother with this one
0	this live album/in-studio acoustic ep is hard to figure . most of the live stuff is selected from bls 's `` stronger than death '' album , which was n't all that great to begin with . the only good thing being ; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of `` all for you '' and `` 13 years of grief '' sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts . a new heavier version of `` no more tears '' tries to please , but fails by showing zakk wylde 's gruff vocals do n't always work . unexpectedly , the bonus acoustic ep is the far better attraction . `` like a bird '' is the best song neil young never wrote and `` blood in the well '' shows zakk 's soloing chops in full form . bls needed some better songs before doing a live record . end of story
0	maybe its just me but the piano is out of tune badly enough that it should not have been recorded . i had to force myself to finish listening to the concerto and did not even bother with the rest . sad piece of work
1	this cd has alot of tight hits including : nann by trick daddy and who dat ' by j.t . money . there are too many good songs to name for this cd , those are the biggest i like and i like all the others too . i can practically just listen to the whole cd without stopping it , which usually never happens with other cd 's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs are junk . but this cd has all the hip hop hits that it proclaims . i suggest anyone looking at this review or cd , to buy the cd . it 's worth it , definetely ! one last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd at all i think in my own opinion.i am from st. louie and i am telling ya 'll to look out for a new group called nelly also , there hit single is already out `` country grammar '' and cd soon to be out . get that when it comes out to . peace out ya 'll
1	i really think it 's simon 's best . this , and perhaps ( in a very different style ) `` paul simon . '' i 'm just listening to it again after several years ... the melodies are intricate , the words are vivid and allusive , the range is astounding . graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on , but i really think this is my favorite . i know a lot of non-simon fans who love this one album . it 's just fantastic
0	following 2002 's self-produced and underrated under rug swept , morissette returns in 2004 with so-called chaos . with this release , morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she 's aspiring to take hollywood by strom but is n't 100 % sure . maybe the new look and image might have worked if morissette 's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it 's not . this cd starts out good with the opening cut `` eight easy steps , '' a fast-paced rockin ' tune with alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment . `` out is through '' follows and also stands out , but then so-called chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge . and morissette should never have brought john shanks or tim thorney ( or both ) on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks . `` doth i protest too much '' is without a doubt the worst song alanis has ever recorded . the title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by morissette 's lyrics ( yes , not her best work ) when she refers to heartburn , headaches , and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle . the tracks continue with `` all of me , '' and `` this grudge , '' both rather dull , while the closing track `` everything '' was a weak choice for the first single . morissette has always been a progressive artist , but so-called chaos does n't measure up to any of its predecessors , and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place .
0	apart from the great selection of soundtracks , what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing . executed with finesse , these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited , fuller versions : like `` singing in the rain '' , for example . throw in the great price , and this double disc set is a `` must have '' for all lovers of classic movie music
1	i pretty much agree with ej rupert , but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves . i gave this album 4 stars for that very reason . though it was never released as a single , `` my block '' is one of tupac 's best songs ( pre death row era is the best 'pac in my opinion ) . i do n't think there 's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes red and meth 's `` how high '' as an unquestionable classic ( and this is the grimy version of how high ... .not the fluffy remix ) . i still get open to that beat 11 years later . though it is somewhat formulaic , `` poppa luv it '' is still a dope cut from ll cool j . bone thugs n harmony , mary j. blige , and onyx contribute `` everyday thang '' , `` everday it rains '' , and `` live ! ! '' which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion . also , `` sowhatyousayin ' '' is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind . even when you get past those great tracks , you have other bangers like `` kill dem all '' [ kali ranks ] , `` glamour glitz '' [ a tribe called quest ] , and `` still ca n't fade it '' [ warren g. ] that still make for a great listening experience . hell , even the dove shack blew up on the strength of `` summertime in the lbc '' . and the live version of biggie 's `` me my b*tch '' is definitely different from the studio version and it 's great . there 's plenty to love about this album . i also agree that there are too many filler tracks . `` what 's up star '' , `` ol ' skool '' , `` domino 's in the house '' and `` zoom zooms wam wam '' all fall under the filler category . actually , the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and i 'd say that only 10 % of the album is filler . the rest is bangin ' . the show soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any hip hop fan . there are bangers on this album that make it a must own . if you were into hip hop around the time this came out , you remember when half of these songs were played for the first time . there are definitely some classic tracks on this album . i highly recommend it . also , for those of you that want more artists represented , check out the `` rhyme reason '' soundtrack ( which is pretty much similar to this , but with better collabos ) . you 'll find a lot of artists there too . standout tracks : poppa luv it , my block , live ! ! ! , kill dem all , summertime in the lbc , how high ( my favorite ) , everyday thang , everyday it rains , and me my b*tch [ live
1	this album / cd rocks ! ca n't stop playing it ! nuff said
1	these tunes may not immediately remind you of steve miller but his talent is not belied . it 's some really peaceful music . great to turn on just at bedtime and drift off to la la land
1	wow ! what a great collection of great classic songs ! we highly recommend this to anyone with any age kids who want to have fun and have fun without the tv ! hokey pokey baby ... that 's what it 's all about
0	no one questions lyrics born 's talent , which can be matched by few . his breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio , except then if you go see him do it live ( recommended : he is a charismatic performer ) you realize they did n't . the problem with this release is not , therefore , lyrics born himself . it 's just that there 's not enough interesting things happening around him . there are handful of standout songs on this record , but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does . the skits remind me why i sometimes think the whole idea of skits on cds tired itself out in about 1997 , if not earlier . worse , the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable , making the whole album kind of drag , and the grooves , guitar licks and keys , all of which are good in small doses , become sort of flat after a time , especially when joyo velarde is n't singing backup vox . surely a few of the songs could have become b-sides on the single , or something , instead of bloating the album itself . do that there , rise and shine , and one session are my favorite tracks , the ones i would say go buy from the itunes store or something right now . there 's nothing wrong with the rest , i just do n't find myself listening to them much . i like the concept of later that day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to
0	anna netrebko 's i puritani selections are way below the art and skill of callas , sills , sutherland , caballe , and gencer . she has no passion , no trills , no high notes that are deep and rich . her best is in the russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding mozart . her broadcast from the met live of the i puritani was alright , but scooping , avoidance of repetitions , running through passages like a locomotive , and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again , and a tight awful sounding high note . the same tentativenes is also here on this cd.she should know this . her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses , not the voice , which is forgiven everything . too bad ; she could be a lovely tatyana some day.also too , the traviata is not that great ; anna moffo , renee fleming , m. caballe , and of course maria callas..listen to these and hear the difference
1	i think his debut had the best lyrics . this joint gets off to a good start with we still party and pretty much bangs till the end . his production on here is best described as `` late 90 's roger troutman-esque g-funk '' . geust stars like 2nd ii none , amg , suga free and el debarge get their shine on . top joints : we still party ( peter gunz and quik on the track ) quik jacks the verb song from school house rock . ( the jam ) so many wayz hand in hand you'z a ganxta ( quik refutes rumors that he was involved in biggie 's demise . also denounces reference to death in rap songs . ) i useta know her ( should be called i useta hit that ) speed medley for a 'v ' ( the p***y medley ) get 2getha again ( class of 91 , 2nd ii none , amg and quik triple team on this track . ) reprise ( medley for a 'v )
0	i love his voice , but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted . there are about 12 key changes in every song . the melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs . i feel these affectations detract from the songs . while his vocal gymnastics are very impressive , the result just is n't enjoyable to listen to ( unless you are a voice student or professional singer )
1	i will state first off that i 'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss pearl jam 's debut album , `` ten , '' as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is . if you think that makes me inherently biased ( unbalanced ? ) this review probably wo n't be `` helpful '' to you , and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews . if you decide to hear me out , i promise to be fair , 'cause even though i may be a hipster snob , i ca n't deny to myself the sweet rockin ' going on in `` vitalogy . '' this album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called `` underground '' or indie rock and the `` classic '' rock mainstream . thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it does n't sound sloppy . ballads like `` better man '' and its companion piece `` nothingman '' are clearly influenced by neil young and even `` nebraska '' -era springsteen -- they 're sincere emotional but not mushy sentimental . `` not for you , '' with it 's lyrics about how eddie vedder 's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes , is a none-too-subtle complaint about pearl jam 's status as `` millions served '' rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk . that , of course , is more directly the point of `` spin the black circle , '' an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to sst-era husker du . for vedder , the joys of vinyl are that they seem `` warmer '' -- a symbol of `` tradional values '' in a rock 'n ' roll sense : independence , hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny , sterile corporate plastic of compact discs . never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture ; vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12 '' record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves . pearl jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference . on the other hand , the big corporate evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience , which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of `` vitalogy '' -- it 's designed as a salute/satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical/mental/spiritual hygeine . the album , therefore , aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band 's own youth ( the who , neil young ) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the power of rock ( fugazi , sonic youth ) -- hence the title . the album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like `` bugs '' and `` hey foxymophandlemama that 's me , '' even though they 're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel . still , some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like `` last exit '' and the somewhat proggy sea chanty `` tremor christ '' ( whose title i dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement ) . even though it 's uneven , `` vitalogy '' is the work of a self-reliant , even ornery band that 's in full control of their ideas -- even the bad ones . it 's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like stone temple pilots and matchbox 20 .
0	clipped , petite and looking more like a leather bar anne murray , crow drags out the hits and the `friends ' for this all-star live bash . half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends ( all i wan na do , everyday is a winding road , a change would do you good , leaving las vegas ) . with only slight variations on these overplayed originals ( a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms ) crow 's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum . the rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools ( dixie chicks , stevie nicks , eric clapton , sarah mclachlan , chrissie hynde ) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host . reduced to the role of supporting guitarist , crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like nicks ( who unravels admirably on gold dust woman ) , hynde and mclachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit ( hynde 's if it makes you happy ) -and-miss ( mclachlan 's the difficult kind ) headbutt at crow 's hits . but it is n't until clapton 's suspendered , cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update cream 's white room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it 's devastating climax . fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies , clapton 's return to the electric psychedelics of his paleolithic past is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic brontosaurus . it 's horrifying to think that this is what cream would have sounded like if they had n't broken up . thank god for egos . it 's almost a relief to hear richards mindlessly croak his way through the old stones exile-era toss-off happy , as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but . besides , richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an egyptian mummy . the wrapper finds the entire gang , from spanky nicks to buckwheat clapton , joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten rendition of dylan 's tombstone blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one
1	very rich in music , fully orchestrated and full of energy . i highly recommend this album for everyone who loves new age music and to all those who like classical music . david took it to another level on this one . i myself like new age artists that incorporate orchestra to their music and that is why i loved this album . if you like this album , i recommend you to explore yanni , secret garden , giovanni and bernward koch
0	i was babysitting , and the kid was listening to the cd , and asked why billie joe sounded so sick . x

0	chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world , he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy . along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop , and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless ( which is not true ) . jackpot went multi platinum , which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat . in fact the beats are n't all that bad , if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as i would not have to listen to his irritating voice . if you heard right thurr in a club and thought it was tight ( like i did ) , you are wrong , chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats . his lyrics are absolute garbage , what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production , and some top lyricists have to work with nothing . compared to this album , his follow up powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser . find him working at a mcdonalds near you soon ! !
0	please make these songs available to listen - with windowsmedia !
1	we bought this - on cassette - in washington dc on our first day of honeymoon in september 1997 . having flown from northern ireland , it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from washington to nashville , along the skyline drive , down through south west virginia , across eastern kentucky to berea , and down to smoky mountains national park in tennessee . we are from an ulster-scots/scotch-irish background , and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had settled in so many centuries before , bringing thier fiddles and folk songs with them , creating what was the core of mountain old-time music and bluegrass . from the carter family right through , every song is a classic . you must buy this
1	i ca n't even begin to say how much i love these albums ( i just picked uyi 1 to write my review for both ) . everyone always says that appetite is guns best album ... no way in hell . the illusion albums are so much richer . now do n't get me wrong , i love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes . the illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework . i can identify with so many of axls lyrics , and the music just makes them stand out so much more . slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever , and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career . and the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best , such as : locomotive , bad apples , dont damn me , the garden , pretty tied up , coma , civil war , get in the ring , breakdown , estranged ( kind of popular but still fairly unknown ) 14 years , bad obscession , dust n bones , dead horse , and more . then of course there are the hits , dont cry , november rain , knockin on heavens door , live and let die , you could be mine etc . the only songs i dont really like that much are my world ( wtf ? ) and shotgun blues , but everything else is just so gdamn good . do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan . the illusion albums are art , plain and simple
0	like so many new-age artists , ryan farish has a great ear for melodies . unlike most new-age artists , ryan farish has rhythmic problems . he likes to use the delay effect on his piano , but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing ( sometimes it 's one problem and sometimes it 's both ) . i do n't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album . also , the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly
0	i was very excited to hear that this new muppets holiday offering was coming ! the previous two christmas albums ( `` a christmas together '' w/ john denver `` a muppet christmas carol '' ) have long been family favorites at hour house in december . however , this time i am disappointed . most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous . i realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us . but , to focus on these voices so much ( kermit , rowlf , dr. teeth , statler waldorf , the swedish chef ) in this album , only produces a disappointing reminder that the `` muppets '' we grew up with are long gone . maybe i am being a little hard on this cd . but , there are plenty of muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices ( robin , sam , honeydew beaker , rizzo , louzeland , etc ) . those voices added to those of ganzo , miss piggy and fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel . there are a couple of good cuts on the album . one is `` merry christmas '' by pepe . the other is `` santa baby '' by miss piggy . sadly , over all i can not recommend this cd .
0	this album lacks a lot of the controversy ( not all of it ) of the original , uncensored `` cop killer '' ( new censored version now titled body count ) . go to ebay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the 92 album . you will like it a hell of a lot better
1	i love every track on ne-yo 's cd `` in my own words ! '' next let me thank ne-yo for bringing true r back to the industry ! i dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife r r is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow love songs . and from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs did n't exist . i ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90 's over and over until i got so tired of them , and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station ( that plays mostly rap : a genre of music i dont like ) to play `` so sick '' by ne-yo . it was a great song . this is literally the first and only r album that i never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song ! ne-yo 's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too ! he is a lyrical genius . his voice is soothing and melodic . most r albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed r songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the cd out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the cd , but this album has all songs that are great . all of the tracks on this album are great , but here are the ones that are superb : 1 . so sick - 9/10 ( would be a 10 if it was n't played over and over and with so many different versions . although i can still listen to it over and over 2 . when you 're mad - 9/10 ( for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad . maybe for michelle rodriguez fans . : ) ) 3 . get down like that 10/10 ( both versions ) ( i call it `` dont get down like that '' ) ( this song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me ) ( if you 're not a player , and proud of being faithful , this is da song for you ) 4 . sexy love - 10/10 ( great song . um hmmm.. what can i say about this one about its lyrics ? ... . oh yes ... . this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them , it just feels like ... . magic . ) this is da only cd dat ever deserved 5 stars by me , the only reason i gave other r albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration : there was no r album that existed that had nothing but good tracks , and most had poorly done upbeat song
1	what makes a voice distinctive and memorable ? nat ( king ) cole i believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer . clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his . aside from 'unforgettable ' the songs i best remember are 'mona lisa ' and 'nature boy ' . but this recording also includes originals of the 'nat king cole trio ' . it also includes the famous duet put together of 'unforgettable ' from his early version and his daughter natalie cole 's recording made after he had passed on . that particular recording was a 'knockout ' sentimental and beautiful .
0	usually jerry 's scores for movies are priceless , ( i.e . the other score for `` legend '' ) but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too '' forced '' for my taste.it 's ok as a weird sort of comedy album , i suppose , but from the main theme i was laughing because it 's meant to be such a serious experience-but is n't ! i think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd . ( .
1	... .and secured their musical legacy . the real thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired mike patton providing vocals . on angel dust , patton had a lot more creative input , providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to faith no more . it 's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially , has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason . this album is all over the board . land of sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies ( which is the supposed inspiration ) , while caffeine is an anthem for patton 's drug of choice , and one of fnm 's most energetic recordings . then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing patton 's range and sense of fun , like rv , which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an rv . not exactly bilboard material , but fun . adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band . jim martin was having creative differences , yet pumps out some of his best work here . tensions may have fueld a more agressive record , and fnm would never sound better than they do on this album . it 's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work . commercially , this might have not been the hit the record company wanted , but its legacy can still be heard today and it 's still a great record to crank up for a drive , barely showing its 15 year old age
1	i got this disc for one song , the uncut , full length version of `` boogie wonderland '' by earth , wind and fire ( with the emotions ) . the rest of the disc is good - but `` boogie wonderlan '' is in a class by itself ! ! five stars !
1	i really like this new singer , he has a style all of his own . i recently bought his new cd `` a swingin ' time '' and i also had to have this , his first cd offered on amazon . i 'm really hooked on monte procopio 's unique approach to these classic songs , ca n't wait for more
0	this album was one of my biggest `` mistakes '' ( bought it 3 years ago ) . it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band . better you buy instead : up the bracket ( the libertines ) or some strokes-stuff..
0	ignore the unique cover , clever song idea ( there is 30 ) which represent a comic book . ignore all that . it simply is not good . what is this ? i dont even know how to describe this music . it 's not even songs , but more a bunch of really short experimental , non-sensequel , inerworkings of annoyance . they will start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song , but its only a tease , until they stop and go slow , to say , '' get on with it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' add a bunch of zany sound effects , not to mention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringing out , sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams , and sounds , that add up , to one of the most pointless albums ever put out
1	wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album . its just that darn good of a song . but hey , the whole album is good . the title track is brutally awesome , especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd ( iron maiden box set ) . and murders in the rue morgue is another classic . then there is drifter , and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan ( who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort ) . maybe not as good as their debut album , but still a masterpeice of an album
0	i loved `` come away with me '' the first moment i heard it . i also had the opportunity to see norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely fantastic ! i could n't have asked for a better ! so naturally i waited in eager anticipation for her new album `` feels like home '' which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic . it was a good thing i did n't try and listen to it while driving . to be perfectly honest , i have n't listened to it since . she is so talented , i wish this effort had been as successful as the first , but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat . but i still hold out hope that her next album will be better
1	a ridiculously good album . this is as good an introduction to jawbox as you 're going to find . it 's got most of their really great songs , plus some live songs which are great . another good thing is that desoto records ( the label that was started by the band ) has re-released the cd , so it should n't be as hard to find
0	i purchased this cd shortly after finding out that nickel creek would be disolving their union as a band . i hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself ( as a strong supporter of nickel creek ) and my two children . this cd honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that nickel creek produced over the past 7 years . although , i guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this cd . you have to keep in mind that the members of nickel creek were just children themselves when they released this cd . i do n't believe that they had found their true musical identity , and they obviously would n't have reached their full musical potential yet . this cd is n't really the best for a todler either , so i have to say that this purchase was a let down overall
1	plain and simple ... cage is one of the best underground rappers around ... ..and soon after hell 's winter drops i think he will be accepted into mainstream ... ... this cd is cage at his craziest , the beats are hott , the rhymes are hot ... buy this cd ... .and if you like this cd buy some of his other cds , weatherproof , night hawks , smut peddler 's : porn again , the leak brothers : water world , and hell 's winter
0	when i think of the sex pistols , i think the monkeys did it better as a boy band . let 's face it , dears , that is all the sex pistols were : a marketing ploy . they are f -- -- -g nsync for another generation
0	unlike most other items i 've bought from amazon , i failed to read the reviews for this particular cd before purchasing . being a fan of the final fantasy series , i think i fell into a bit of the `` fanboy '' ( well in my case , `` fangirl '' i guess ) syndrome . also i did n't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording , which it most certainly is not . i own most of the final fantasy ost 's ( and heartily endorse them for fans of the games ) and this particular cd does nothing new or compelling to the music . tracks 1-7 are pretty much carbon copies of their ost counterparts . track 8 , the opening theme of ffviii ( liberi fatali ) has a very odd synth-solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section . tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the ost . track 12 , `` alexandria ( vivi 's theme ) '' is the only somewhat-original track , as it seems to put together several pieces from the ffix soundtrack in a medley of sorts . unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything ff , i recommend saving up and purchasing the real ost 's instead of this disc . while i do n't see non-fans flocking to purchase this disc , it might be worthwile if you 're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste . even in that event i 'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely . pros : cheap ( i paid $ 6 , new ) track 12 is worth a listen cons : tracks 1-7 , 9-11 offer nothing much new or different track 8 has creepy ( in a bad way ) synth/voice mixe
0	here 's a line from the song vato on this album : `` i would n't be the n_____ that i am if i did n't pop n____z in the mouth . '' is n't that poetic ? snoop dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat . he makes sex , drugs and violence seem so ... boring . i feel like i am supposed to be offended . but it 's too boring to be offensive . we have songs about every kind of gang violence , every kind of drug , and every kind of cheap sex . and what are we left with ? he gets two stars because his approach to the city of los angeles is fresh and loving . hip hop should be local , and he does a good job with that . otherwise it 'd be a one-star
1	this era of tangerine dream ( td ) was just great . the virgin years were truly a great period for td . for me it deals with space and landscape . it 's so close to repetitive music that would come much later . it 's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies . you could fly with them and end up with more in the end . you ca n't say that for too many of these electronic groups . after that period they would go on with this ambient music that was n't up to the same standards . it seems they are back ( with other musicians of course ) with the same kind of concept . great ! they were an important link on the electronic scene . a great album ! a great period
1	this is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a tedeschi concert . she can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness : she just ca n't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs . she 's terrific on the ballads but is n't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals . she 's got solid keyboards and vocals in support , so it 's not apparent until half way through the gig . but keyboards ca n't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast , upbeat songs and the whole concert lags . zzzzz by 2/3rds of the way through . look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of `` i fell in love . '' very few people ( besides the b3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show ) are energized . put this dvd on when you 're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the fireplace is going and it 'll be terrific , at least until you fall asleep
1	i discovered seal the same way that most people did : through his utterly beautiful song `` kiss from a rose '' . i heard it on the radio one day , and played it constantly for months after that until i finally decided to purchase the album the song was from . as it happens , the song is from seal 's most revered album , his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album . ( this is not to be confused with his other self-titled album , his debut , released in 1991 . ) i did n't know what to expect when i bought the album , having heard only one song from it , but months after purchasing it i 'm glad i made the gamble . i think that the sub-genre which best classifies seal is urban . urban music , according to all music guide , is smooth and polished , often romantic , sometimes uptempo and funky , and features soulful vocals . seal has all of this and more . it has techno beats , but they 're not as overwhelming as one might expect . they blend together with peaceful , occasionally ethereal guitars and seal 's incredibly soothing singing . this is , no doubt , stylish music , but first and foremost it 's a collection of warm , encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician . there 's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here ; there 's not even a slightly weak composition . thus it 's a little harder to pick highlights than usual . some highlights include the strong opening track , `` bring it on '' ; the emotional hit `` prayer for the dying '' ; the shimmering `` dreaming in metaphors '' ; the upbeat `` newborn friend '' ; and , needless to say , the absolutely wonderful `` kiss from a rose '' . the closing track , `` bring it on ( reprise ) '' is another beautiful song , but `` kiss from a rose '' is possibly the most lovely song i 've ever heard . listening to it in the warmth of one 's home during a snowy december afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience . the message of the album , if there is one , is `` keep on going - life is beautiful ! '' it could fail under any other popular artist , but seal succeeds marvelously . this is some of the most heartfelt , inspirational singing i 've ever heard . there 's a delightful optimism in seal 's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive . it 's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this . seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of r ( or rock - you decide ) . these songs have clear , strong messages , warm , inspirational lyrics , heartfelt , soothing singing , danceable beats , and a whole lot of emotion . once you 've heard `` kiss from a rose '' , i guarantee you 'll want to pick up the album . if you 're already thinking of doing so , then i encourage you to go forward and buy it ; you wo n't regret it . it 's become one of my favorite albums . when you 're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general , look no further than seal to make you cherish it once again .
1	if you think yer gon na puke everytime you have to suffer through a `` country '' song from nashville these days , and you happen to like classic rock , you would probably appreciate what shooter 's trying to do here . folks , this is the real deal . i do n't mean real country or real rock - this is a hybrid - i mean he 's making music that is honest and down to earth . a flash in the pan , he 's not . he 's going to be around for awhile
1	released is the kind of album you put in , kick your feet up with a good beverage , and head off to someplace on the silverscreen of your mind that is pure tranquility . oster 's trumpet echoes on long after the music is off . here 's hoping there 's more from this new and amazing artist
0	this album is so boring in most places . i do n't know where keith sweat 's head was at . it does n't keep your attention on the second half . keep it comin ' was okay , but the other songs keith produced as well as joe public were lousy . he was smart to include there you go from new jack city , but the songs before and after it are so bland , it seemed like the formula that worked for keith sweat 's first two albums did n't work here . i fell to sleep while hearing the album 's second half -- how can anyone create such dull songs on here ? sweat 's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs . if he had wanted to , he would have given these songs to usher instead of singing them himself -- they 'd be better under him ( usher ) . but i warn you , do n't get this album -- it 's going to let you down
1	as one of the founding fathers of today 's heavy metal rock music , iron butterfly has them power , drive , and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music . this live album serves as a testament to that fact . eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960 's through the mid 1980 's was primative at best ( by today 's standards ) , this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era . this is a `` must-have '' for all iron butterfly fans
1	this cd is the funniest cd i own . the first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny . the second half is a little hard to understand , and it louds like is was recorded poorly , that is why i gave it four stars . track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy . eddie makes fun of stevie wonder and boxer larry holmes , and he does it well
0	first bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician . it seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary . here 's what chaps my hide the most . bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch . it burns me too no end when a person calls himself a `` jazz '' guitarist , but does n't really have any chops . i know bill has been called anti-technique , but what does that really mean ? would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well , but really is n't very good at what he/she does ? this guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time i turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face . i 've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years . when i have guys that actually debate me that bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say pat martino , or that bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like pat martino , i have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that frisell could n't imagine . is bill frisell a jazz musician , no ! maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he 'd come up with something . for me i 'll stick with the guys that really know how to play ... ... johnny smith , peter leitch , jim hall , pat martino , kenny burrell , billy bauer , tal farlow , lenny breau , jimmy bruno , jimmy raney , wes montgomery and so on
0	i do n't see the comparison to jeff buckley at all ! that was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album . all the songs are much too similar , the guy 's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and , if you remember london suede , has a very similar sound to them ( though i will say that london suede was much better ) . no one has come close to the pipes of j. buckley ( or even tim b. , for that matter ) in years and this does n't count any where near that , either
0	the only reason i picked up this album was the name norah jones . i was expecting to hear her at the forefront , and i did n't really . to be honest , i was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in come away with me and feels like home . if you 're looking for norah jones , this is n't really the album you 're looking for
1	i got the lp version of this album as a christmas present in 1988 . i immediately fell in love with it . she sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the reagan years ( `` talkin about a revolution '' , `` fast car '' ) . but she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s , which they did . `` mountains o things '' was about the materialsim of the 80s . other issues she covers are racism ( `` across the lines '' ) and domestic abuse ( `` behind the wall '' ) . even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated , as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988 . i bought the cd version in 1992 and i never get tired of listening to it . all of the songs are good but my favorite ones are `` talking about a revolution '' , `` fast car '' , `` baby can i hold you '' , `` mountains of things '' , `` why '' and `` for my lover '' .
1	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson . the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones . lou even opts to 'chill ' out on a number called 'over the rainbow ' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk ' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine . the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album.keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !

0	i bought this cd after hearing tony on one of the am morning shows , and really likings some of his past offerings , but i have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money . i was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money 's worth . tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years , and i expected a more mature offering from him than this latest . there is a great lack of maturity on this cd , and it 's an overall disappointment . unfortunately , i have to say here that toney is not alone . what on earth possessed veteran soul singers the o'jays to sing a song like let 's ride ? who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages ? hoochie mommas ? what ? babyface ? even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd ! and what 's up with the explicit lyrics ? we all know you can curse like sailors , but why is this language necessary in music ? and i know that artist have always performed their music , but will someone tell me why it 's necessary to perform with so few clothes on ? i would rather hear your music , not see your booty ! sorry , but a review i just read triggered me , and i 'd been thinking about the tony terry cd for a while . hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time . meanwhile i think you 're safe in skipping this particular cd
0	informatively , i have mason 's dvd 's , which i quite enjoy . however , this cd , labelled , `` brand new , '' contains many repeats and situations . in fact , at times i was ahead of jackie mason , mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to me . mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline , to the extent that much of the cd sounded like gibberish . for most of this cd i sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned . mason , in my opinion , went overboard in his use of obscenities , loudly and in his asides , seemingly contrived for shock value . as for me , i think that this mislabelled , `` brand new , '' cd was a flop , and i would not care to have it in my collection for fear of the impression i would leave after my demise . so , another item destined for my shredder . finally , i would recommend the mason dvd 's , which i would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that add little to his performance . robert lyons reno , nevad
1	this is , i believe , the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band . it begins with a nice quick paced tune , `` second hand news '' and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there . the album itself does not have a bad tune on it . in fact , of all the 'regular ' albums from fleetwood mac ( excluding greatest hits compilations ) , this album has more hits on it than any other . hits like 'dreams , ' 'never going back , ' 'do n't stop , ' 'go your own way , ' 'the chain ' and 'you make loving fun . '' all of these get enormous radio play . moreover , 'dreams ' was a number one hit , and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end , and has sold over 18 million copies in the u.s. and over 30 million worldwide , putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time . in fact , an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america 's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell 'rumor ' there would inevitably be two 'u 's ' in the spelling . now that is a very strong impact on culture . every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album . one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album , `` never going back '' which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock 's premier guitarists , lindsey buckingham , and , in my opinion , the best christine mcvie song ever written , `` songbird . '' now , with this release , you can also get , on a second cd , the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album . this makes for great listening , to hear how the songs developed and were recorded . moreover , early demos are included along with two 'jam sessions . '' now , more than ever , this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music ( or music in general for that matter ) . if you are a fleetwood mac fan , then chances are you own this album , but if you are just getting introduced to the band , then you must buy this cd . i highly recommend it
0	i do not like parker 's style at all . i ca n't really say anything else . it is all in the way you format a song , and i just do n't like parker
1	if you enjoyed explosions in the sky 's last album `` the earth is not a cold dead place '' , and the songs by the group on the `` friday night lights soundtrack '' , then surely , you shall find love for their newest record `` all of a sudden i miss everyone '' . if you are new to explosions in the sky , i can only personally describe their music to you as lush , captivating , graceful , energetic , and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations . please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they do n't like it as much as their last album ( yet ) . `` all of a sudden i miss everyone '' is different than previous records ; it is alot darker , but at the same time hopeful and promising , best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night ( again , personal description ) . what more can i say ... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound . my favorite album of 2007 so far .
1	let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first , yet you get over them very quickly , except for a few spots . even so , they do not lower my score for the album , and at times are quite catchy . savage - good riffs , good solos , catchy , purely driven madness to start this insane album . 93/100 where my fortune lies - the intro is absolutely nuts , and the highlight of the song . probably my least favorite after this , yet the solos are still out of this world . 87/100 ninja - what a great song ! the intro is one of the greatest things i have heard in my life , and this song may actually have you humming along at points . ninja ! very well laid out , and the solos at the end are the best so far on the album . brilliance . 97/100 concerto - amazing once again , and becker the 17 year old prodigy showcases himself throughout . he proves he is the master of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album , and this song is an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other . more notes played in 4 1/2 minutes than in george harrison 's entire career . 98/100 burn the ground - fastest on the album solo wise in fact becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its human . very melodic too except when there are vocals , the song is kinda of disgusting . 87/100 desert island -another amazing song very well laid out with great solos and great riffs . the outro is the perfect intro to speed metal symphony . the vocals are actually good on this song , like ninja. , an entertaining song . 97/100 speed metal symphony - nine minutes of shredding and arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any shredder 's ears . everything about this song is good . 97/100 there is n't much to say about this album except becker and friedman show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to play in a melodic and listenable way . i would recommend this over yngwie malmsteen , who has not improved since his first album
0	what a shame . c.a . was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice . maybe she wanted to be this way , but most likely , it was a manager , or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears . more is not always better , and in this case , it is definitely worse . hopefully , she banked her $ $ , cuz i ca n't imagine that she 'll ever recover from this debacle . that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood . very sad
0	god , i ca n't believe this guy . ja rule was never a gangsta in his life , he ca n't talk gangsta . and stop trying to be like tupac , tupac actually was a gangsta . your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you 'd wet your pants . this guy should be booted out of the game , not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s*** as if he went through it , his ruining hip hop . yeah and ja , stop dissing eminem and 50 . you know perfectly well that they 'd kill you in a battle anyday . ja rule has always been s*** . go listen to real rap
0	hmm sounds good , jazzy and chic . this should only be played in lounges . the only tracked i liked was amour . the rest i wanted to close my ears . too much noise
0	i love to hear old standards and such . but i like to hear people who put their own take on it . i ca n't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe . where are the male versions of nora jones ? tone down the cheese ! we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter ( not hams like buble , dusk , or boring singers like diana krall . but what can i expect from the music industry ? rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention . so , hmmm , nevermind . i guess it 's always been that way
1	this is one of the truly great handel opera recordings of the last twenty years . as usual , nicholas mcgegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest handelian conductors of our time . the singing from beginning to end is first class . this opera is known for the famous largo `` ombra mai fu , '' but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight
0	cheap trick 's second album is very disappointing to me after the good , but raw , `` live in the studio '' , 1977-76 recorded cheap trick . almost all of the material here is so watered down that it really comes off way better on the later many live disks they did . after a good start w/ `` hello there '' , a concert favorite for many years , is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the budokan and other live recordings later . tom werman and rick niesen were on a show in 1991 that i had recorded on a tape once and werman , noce a friend of tom petersson 's said , quote : `` my three albums with cheap trick got better and better ... '' , to which the ever sarcastic rick nielsen said , `` selling , maybe . '' not realizing that brother rick was slamming him , werman then continued , `` exactly '' ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums through the years has become like playing russian roulette . it 's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid , but somewhat oeverrated 'heaven tonight ' came out ... ( and the guys even bought werman back for dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined the band . yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80 '
1	this is a good collection , 15 of supertramp 's best songs and the best single-disc collection of theirs you will find . the sound is great and there are no filler songs , here , they 're all great to listen to . highly recommended
0	i remember buying a record by dna when it first came out ... and i was really surprised later when arto lindsay and the ambitious lovers were able to turn this mess into great music . this is very unprofessiona
0	eric reed is a monster pianist . under the right circumstances , he could record a christmas album that would become an instant classic . this , however , is an unfortunate example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do everything himself . reed produced and arranged this album himself . probably if he had hired an objective producer , that producer would have told him to hire an arranger . reed 's arrangements are second-rate . his version of `` santa claus is coming to town '' has been downshifted into a parody that serves as the worst example of an annoying trend : reed attempts to put a fresh twist on nearly every song . it 's an admirable goal , but he does n't have what it takes ; and the result is like a restaurant that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork , and swordfish crumbled over salad . it just does n't work . i hope this is n't the last christmas album from eric reed . he 's one of the truly original voices of his generation ; and with his gospel background and feel for the blues , there 's no doubt in my mind he could record an album that would rival `` a charlie brown christmas . '' but this is n't it . he needs to hand over the reins of his next project and focus on the piano
1	back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike , there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as `` bubblegum pop , '' and one group that would never have staying power . but i think it 's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh . parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success . this album is also the first where debbie harry 's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet , vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next . the album made punk , pop , and disco shake hands , which was a method unheard of in 1978 . songs like `` hanging on the telephone , '' `` picture this , '' `` pretty baby , '' and `` sunday girl , '' have become irresitable pop gems , while `` i know but i do n't know , '' and `` fade away radiate , '' featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp , are punk-driven classics . last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in `` one way or another , '' and `` heart of glass . '' and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years ? as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked # 140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time , `` madonna was surely watching . ''
1	ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds . this time , there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire , this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there . with enough ( ten ) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar , there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp . between such monster hits as lesley gore 's pre-womens ' rights anthem `` you do n't own me '' , the exciters go-and-get-him `` tell him '' and kathy young 's barely pubescent `` a thousand stars '' are cradled such rarities as the secrets ' `` the boy next door '' ( a madara-white , of `` you do n't own me '' and other gore tunes fame , composition ) , april stevens ' `` teach me tiger '' ( later with brother nino tempo striking it big with `` deep purple '' ) and timi yuro 's ( of `` hurt '' fame ) `` what 's a matter baby '' . in this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so . many of the tracks ( 2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28 ) appear in stereo , the remainder in mono . the 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented . ace again hits the mark with this new compilation
0	`` what 's up '' , the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune ( which , i always thought , would have been the perfect song for heart ) , is the only thing good here . the rest of this album is a mess . linda perry has , of course , gone on to better things
1	nobody captures the spirit and essence of a city at night like new york city 's own ultrablue . the group is the brainchild of keyboardist/producer john smatla and jazz guitarist dave stryker , who bring in an nyc all-star cast of players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a sophisticated and evocative musical mood . ultrablue is the latest outing for ultrablue , and the first release on 215 records . the project drips of chill , smooth jazz , and rich , rhythmic textures that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in your car and home players and on your ipod . special guests include singer/saxophonist pete belasco , trumpet/flugelhorn player randy brecker , female vocal group , allure , flutist nestor torres and brazilian vocalist gabriella anders . from the sexy saunter , `` guilty pleasures '' and the spicy and sultry , `` indiscretions , '' to the scintillating `` soul candy , '' ultrablue provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in ( for that matter ) . pete belasco is featured on the sensual cover `` the summer knows '' while nestor torres livens things up on the groove , `` jungle fever , '' and the delicious gabriela anders delivers an alluring vocal on `` destiny . '' the project 's first single , `` shiver , '' is already attracting radio airplay from coast to coast ... we expect big things from ultrablue on this and all of their future releases . this is the new standard of smooth jazz . ~sandy shor
1	the clean kick-started the illustrious new zealand label flying nun in 1981 , providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from australia ( the chills ) to california ( pavement ) . over this two-disc , 46-track set of rarities and essentials , the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the velvet underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited , rudimentary playing , shaky , kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies . disc one , as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs , ends with the clean 's 1983 breakup . disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996 's unknown country , mining similar material with even more exciting ( and even better-sounding ) results . but by then , lots of bands were doing what the mighty clean had helped pioneer .
1	really , this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy . this is , of course , funny stuff . really , it 's the kind of music where you do n't want other people to know you 're listening to it , but oh my is it fun ! this one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwie-inspired power metal-album : soaring guitars , high-pitched vocals , double-bass drumming , a lot of neoclassical stuff ( essentially the sound of mozart , bach and beethoven , just way less complex ) both on the keyboards and the guitars . and of course , trumpets and brass . oh , how i loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a keyboard . cheese , cheese , cheese all the way ! if you 've heard any rhapsody-material before , a song-by-song breakdown is pretty unnecessary as you 'll know exactly what to expect . they really did benefit from the better production on their next album ( not to mention their latest opus ! ) but legendary tales does n't sound bad by any means , and the songwriting is solid and pretty diverse . it 's just cheesy , real cheesy ! and truth be told , since it 's a metal album the guitars could use a little more 'oomph ' here and there . this is more happy metal than heavy metal , but then again , they 're singing about mystical lands and holy creatures , so behemoth-like heavy guitars would n't really fit . we do n't wan na scare our warrior of ice now , do we
0	i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd-a system . i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing ... and the mix to be a bit `` over the top '' with surround effects . major vocals coming from rear speakers , etc . i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk . in fact , the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song `` let 's get it on '' and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection . if you are looking for dvd-a disks with 5.1 surround ... i 'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album .
0	etta never fails to deliver in the vocals . gutteral bombast , sweet soul , gospel , blues , the lady is a living legend . but this album , like the last album `` produced '' by her son , is a nightmare . chessy arrangments , tinkly bass , poor sound all around . she is a fierce mother and i 'm sure she thinks her kids know best , but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer . should etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck , she would n't need the novelty of some of the song choices . ps - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer ; blues , r/b , soul , whatever , in the world .
0	this one is for you . but honestly now , the guy does n't write -- beautiful voice -- but songwriting is a major appeal . so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake . ok , there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork , ( what a ) wonderful world , but generally this a very casual compilation , good for a couple listens . in general , art garfunkel is n't really good for more than that . check out him witht paul simon , that is amazing stuff , but this is kinda boring . i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs -- but even though there are good songwriters writing for him , the songs are still sub-par
0	awful . i mean , really awful ... and i liked `` self portrait '' because you knew dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image . this album is just a disaster . the lyrics are ok on most songs ( i 've seen worse by dylan ) , but the music is unexciting , not very creative , and downright embarrassing on some tracks . why , oh , why did you have to make an album like this , bob ? such talented people at your disposal for these sessions , and you threw it away on garbage arrangements . shameful . really sad .
0	as a gene autry fan , particularly of his christmas recordings , i was really looking forward to this release . but ... what a disappointment ! i will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts ? they are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable . and , i know the disc is short , but were the 2 second pauses between tracks really necessary ? talk about choppy . no flow at all . this cd did make me do one thing ... go back into my archives and pull out my original grand prix vinyl . i think i 'll be doing a transfer and retire this cd to the bottom shelf .
0	after reading glowing reviews of the dbts i picked up three of their cds . while some of the lyrics are strong , the songs have no melodies whatsoever . most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer . they 're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of skynyrd and the allmans . but those bands were n't just loud guitars ... they had memorable tunes and great singers . dbts are a huge letdown
1	i have been looking for a particular song for several years . this album had it
1	i am very satisfied with the 1999 cd by prince . it was in top condition when it arrived . i would purchase again from the seller . thank
0	i 'd like to second some of the other reviewers ' reviews of this album . it really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album . the tracks in general are a little slower . the production quality is overall about the same , but it is just not as `` listenable '' as believe was . the exception i find on the album is the `` club mix '' of `` turn it around . '' but if we think about that for a second , are n't we talking about `` club music '' here afterall ? are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music ? i should think not . what we expect from this band , and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music . house-ish , trance-ish , and anthemic . it 's just missing on turn it around . i wholeheartedly recommend believe , but i 'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used .
0	like the backstreet boys ( essentially the same band ) , and brittany spears ( their female solo artist - and i use the term loosely- equivalent ) , nsync represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90 's . sure , there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages , but at least groups like the eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments . not nsync , who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who could n't write a decent tune to save their lives - i bet even their voices were digitally altered . and then there were the inescapable hits - bye bye bye , pop , it 's gon na be me , tearin ' up my heart , et al. , that were n't even good the first time around , to say nothing of the nine trillionth . no risks taken . no attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous . basically , this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous ( and probably had never previously met ) , sent them through the assembly line , removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might 've had , and dumped them upon the masses , who they must 've brainwashed or something . i did n't even like this group when i was 10 , to say nothing of now . makes you wish zappa was still alive - he 'd have a field day with a group like this , and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process .
0	it was about time the spell kasey chambers originally cast on me wore off - i 'd become a huge fan of the captain and barricades brickwalls , but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records . chambers , a unique betty boop squeak of a voice , was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts , and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form , but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches . wayward angel , chambers ' third album , had some great songs on it , but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album . carnival shows chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain , bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on the disney channel 's afternoon lineup . `` light up a candle '' fakes its slinkiness and turns dull , `` surrender '' adds a dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that do n't mask the song 's epic ordinariness , ballads like `` dangerous '' limp along to their own generic lethargy . chambers is n't without charm - `` sign on the door '' and `` i got you now '' are impossible to not find fun - yet chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - `` hard road , '' a sad and moving movie-ready duet , borders on self-parody - lines like `` there 's a heavy jacket/ there 's a heavy load/ there 's a weight on my shoulders/ it 's a hard road '' read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you 've ever heard
1	the series of `` golden age of american rock roll '' released by ace could n't have a better end . during the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 cd 's with 30 songs each remembering the rock roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963 . one reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was . now besides these series of 10 cd 's from the r era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title : one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition . both deserve more than 5 stars . the song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight ! most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these were n't available after the time they were top hits . i never found them back on what compilation so ever until ace put them all together 45 years later . and with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm . therefore do n't hesitate . buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure ; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them .
0	flcl is the worst anime of all time , and possibly the worst thing to come out of japan since the pearl harbor attacks , and the soundtrack is just as bad , if not worse . its nothing more than j-pop mixed with bad japanese rock . bad guitar playing , boring drum beats , and inaudible bass ; you 've heard one pillows song , you 've heard them all . only `` otakus '' with no life love this s*** ( like matthew g. salisbury ) . if you want good japanese music , go for king 's evil . ps , that album cover is possibly the worst ever made
1	this album is absolutely fantastic ! paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together . paul sounds very loose and like he 's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows i 've heard . the songs focus mostly on his solo records , with some jam and style council mixed in ( all on disc two ) . wisely , only five of the twenty three tracks are from `` as is now '' and they 're the uptempo ones - it 's not a hard sell by yep roc to make you buy that album if you do n't already have it . the extended jams for `` porcelain gods/broken stones , '' `` in the crowd '' and `` foot of the mountain '' ( one of my favorite solo tracks ) all are focused and do n't wander so they keep your attention . the crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the jam and style council classics get into the mix ( although the sing-along to the album closing `` town called malice '' is pretty lame ) . i have n't listened to the somewhat difficult to find `` live wood '' concert disc for a while to give a good comparison . however , since `` catch-flame '' covers all his solo discs instead of only `` paul weller '' and `` wild wood , '' this is a more balanced collection . highly recommended ! personal highlights : blink and you 'll miss it up in suze 's room porcelain gods/i walk on gilded splinters in the crowd foot of the mountain that 's entertainment broken stones long hot summer shout to the to
1	i thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from the mamas and the papas . every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you 're done listening . like other selections from the 20th century masters series , this ca n't be called a complete collection . however , what is included is fantastic and i find myself popping it into my cd player much more often than many other cds . my copy of this cd ( which i bought new ) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band ( besides the cover photo ) , a short band biography written by joseph f. laredo , and a track listing with song writing and original release credits . song lyrics are not included . the jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper . as a side note , if you are a fan of the abc television series `` lost '' this cd includes the mama cass song `` make your own kind of music '' that is featured on desmond 's record player in the hatch . if you 're just starting with the mamas and the papas , or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs , this is a great cd . for more the mamas and the papas , check out criterion 's phenomenal dvd release of monterey pop ( or the box set the complete monterey pop festival ) . this concert dvd is absolutely brilliant , and includes several songs from the mamas and the papas .
1	like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980 's , the pet shop boys were ahead of their time . this album was purchased mainly for `` west end girls '' and `` it 's a sin . '' play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it 's fantastic . `` loves comes quickly '' emerges for me as the best of the pet shop boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy . the great contributions of great britain and australia to music in the 1980 's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920 's to the early 1950 's ( no doubt the origins of some great movie scores ) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll . you will love the pet shop boys
1	jon brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music . hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie . if you liked this movie , by all means , buy the soundtrack . you will not be dissapointed . eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie , it makes me feel.. just.. good . also , be sure to pick up his solo record , meaningless . if you liked the movie , buy this cd , you wont regret it
0	brooks dunn , kenny chesney , lonestar , martina mcbride , montgomery gentry , aaron tippin , lee greenwood , neal mccoy , kenny rogers , randy travis , phil vassar , the warren brothers , dusty drake , hank williams jr. , alabama , the charlie daniels band , david ball , and blackhawk . what do these artists have in common ? cutting edge musical geniuses ? gifted songwriters able to speak to a wide range of audiences ? innovators in their genre ? err , no . actually what they all have in common is that they all appear on this package , created to commercially exploit the war on terrorism , one which contains songs like where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly , this ai n't no rag , it 's a flag , and back where i come from . in other words , maudlin , xenophobic , cliche filled , black/white dichotomous sentiments , and the lack of any attempt at rational or questioning political analysis , all set to fiddles and pedal steel guitars , and to be marketed and sold at wal-mart . i should add that i am not against patriotism , when it is intelligent and well informed ; this , however , is dumb , reactionary faux-patriotism . nothing is more so than the song god bless the usa . as an american who loves his country , i can say that this song , with its syrupy sound and its naive lyrics , does not speak for me . i listened to a bit of this schlock on a plane ride a while back just to see how much of it i could take . the answer was - not very much . what little i could take made me want to drink , and heavily . some of these performers , specifically brooks and dunn , randy travis , charlie daniels , and perhaps kenny chesney and even ( i hate to admit ) toby keith are actually fairly talented ; others , like former lounge singer lee greenwood , alabama , montgomery gentry , etc , are 3rd rate musical hacks . ultimately , listening to this nonsense , i 'm reminded that some of the greats of the genre , like johnny cash , hank williams , george jones , and willie nelson were neither knee-jerk reactionaries nor apologists for a ruling political party . then again , dusty drake , montgomery gentry , and blackhawk are no johnny cashes . just nashville hacks , soon to be forgotten .
0	with perverse , mike edwards set out to prove that jesus jones was more than a `sunny , breezy pop band ' , what he ended up proving was that if they were n't no one was interested . sad to say , but pop hooks were what people expected from jj , and actually there are some here , but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook . stick with doubt , that 's where jj peaked , even if some claimed they had `sold out ' . here they are pushing the boundaries , but that does n't always make for a great listening experience
1	ok good cd . im not suprised . ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has . yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings . i like that daddy thing song , and like a dj . this album looks at issues from a mans point of view . ya know we 've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view . ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well . also this is a break from that [ ... ] that is played on the radio .
0	first of all , i am a fan of madonna 's music ( not all of it , but a lot of it ) as well as a huge abba fan . now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists ... and apparently it is here as well , but why ca n't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic ? gim me gim me gim me ( the abba song that is sampled here ) is a fairly simple song to begin with ( as many abba songs are ) but the complicated arrangements ( both vocally and instrumentally ) are what made abba 's songs interesting and fun to listen to . but taking a few bars of the original song , repeating it over and over and over , adding a dance beat , various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece . i think she would 've been better off either following a similar chord progression to gim me gim me gim me or just doing a cover ... perhaps benny and bjrn should 've stuck to their strict `` no sampling '' rule here ! for some reason many of today 's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance ... a good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy 's `` so kylie '' on their american/english album ( the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what 's going on , you 'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression ) . now i 'm not going to say `` hung up '' is a terrible song , because everyone has their own taste . but i 'm sorry to say it just does n't do anything for me..
1	i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb ! ! i now know that the alien movies rock ! the tone of the music fits the movie . i especially like `` ripleys them '' because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through-out the movie . the cloning , learing , remebering and also meeting her clones . i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell . the cast did a great job , acting their hearts out . jean-pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.so if you are n't an alien fan , you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks ! ~ jenna
0	ok - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating ... it 's rodney dangerfield - he was a class act . as for the cd : if you 're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone 's cheesy clavinova , then this cd is for you . i bought this because of the last track , `` rappin ' rodney '' , and boy was i disappointed . it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette . do yourself a favor - get all of rodney 's dvd 's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend
0	i would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with the band jet , but when you do n't have any particular characteristics to call your own , there 's nothing to complain about . of course , this means that there 's nothing to compliment , either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands . people compliment them on bringing the 'old ' and adding the 'new ... ' but i hear nothing new in their music . it 's just ordinary , clichï¿½d classic rock , except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago . if i want to listen to classic rock , i want to hear it on the classic rock stations , not the modern rock stations . those are for the new songs , only . an indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the pitchfork media website ... i ca n't post the link due to strict review guidelines .
1	... because it felt like it predicted that i 'd be listening to the cd someday . i 'm referring to the line `` the kids of ad 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today . '' now i admit that i was 18 in 2000 so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year , but the more general prediction of the inter-generational , timeless appeal of the beatles was right on . i did n't see them on the ed sullivan show . i was born almost twelve years after they broke up , and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon . but i , like many , many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring , have since become a huge fan of all their work . this album has my favorite of all the beatle 's songs : i 'll follow the sun . that song alone is worth the five stars , but thankfully the rest of the album is great too . this album gets a little bit too much grief , and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road , but it 's still better than just about anything else out there .
0	you know , after really trying to like this album , i must agree with k johnson . oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible ( or just plain plain ) upon one or three spins , so when this album did n't move me the first time , i decided to hang back and try again in a few days . then again . and again . and one more time . usually after three or four complete spins ( which was like work , with this one ) the jems will work there way to the surface . sufjian stevens was like that . so was z by my morning jacket . but the problem was that i really wanted to like this one . all the reviews i read were hyping this as the album of the decade , and i wanted them to be right . unfortunately , none of them were right . it is a plodding , lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip ' and failing miserably , to the point of being embarassing almost . like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail ( who will love this , by the way ) , it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album . i have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this , and they do have talent ; it just does n't get me there . i hope they can live up to the hype next time . i truly do..
0	i like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style ' music while i 'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax . this cd just did n't fit . there are a few ok 'songs ' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there 's too much talking/chanting . i found myself distracted when i put this cd on
0	i have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all . i find it grating , and darn near unlistenable . i have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months . miles davis , dave brubeck , kenny burrell , grant green , cannonball adderley , stan getz , chet baker , wes montgomery , bill evans and thelonius monk to name a few . this guy is by far my least favorite . his playing on miles davis cd 's i have and with monk is largely enjoyable and i know he 's a giant . but this stuff ? . the live recording on disc two was so grating i could n't make it through . it sounded to me like a bunch of geese being slaughtered . give me the other guys anytime
0	i honestly feel that tesla reached the end here . after `` psychotic supper '' failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart . with this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of kurt cobain , and here was tesla trying to make up it 's mind what way to go . with the opening track `` the gate '' it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80 's , but then the next song `` solution '' they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90 's . the rest of the songs just followed suit . the groups slogan is `` no machines '' , but there 's also another slogan at foot here , and that 's `` no music direction '' , and for some bands that 's possibly a workable concept as long as there 's an inkling of where the bands roots are . with tesla it 's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song `` signs '' , which is a rock song , to where they do a cover here of joe south 's `` games people play '' . i feel that tesla failed to show thier influences here , and was just trying to make a living ; which is not a bad thing , but it pretty much kept them at a cult status . i pretty much had this album , but did n't listen to it at the time as i was trying to leave the secular music scene behind , and just move onto christianity , and i know the album lurked around in my head all this time , so i felt it was time to face it ; i feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs , and to me it seems they wanted out of the label , and possibly away from each other .
1	this cd offers a great deal of incredible music by john lennon during 1969 and the early 1970 's when he fought our government in order for him and yoko to live in the united states . the quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this cd you want to run to watch the film ! the cd starts off strong with `` power to the people . '' the song makes its political statement and offers a great beat that sticks in your mind . it is also very upbeat and aggressive in its tone which attracts the listener immediately to make them want more . the listener wo n't be disappointed . the tracks that follow provide great insight into john 's politics at the same time that he provides us with his singularly beautiful music . great songs on this cd include the autobiographical `` nobody told me '' in which john admits that his struggle with our government both to end the vietnam war and to remain in the usa is harder than he thought it would be . `` working class hero '' has a folksy , bluesy feel to it but then the cd goes right back to that unique john lennon rock and roll flavor with the song `` i found out . '' `` bed peace '' follows as a type of introduction to the only beatles song on this cd , `` the ballad of john yoko . '' despite the catchy rock and roll beat to `` the ballad of john yoko , '' the lyrics tell the sad story of how people harass john and yoko . another great song is `` give peace a chance ; '' the message here is obvious . `` love , '' `` imagine , '' and `` oh my love '' are beautiful ballads with excellent musical arrangements ; and we get a new instrumental version of `` how do you sleep '' that is very well done . in addition , i like the two live tracks from the john sinclair freedom rally in 1971 . `` attica state '' is a brand new release and `` john sinclair '' packs a strong punch ! these tracks demonstrate so well john 's ability to connect with his audience in a live setting . one special song on this cd directly challenges each and every listener to personal reflection and insight : `` happy xmas ( war is over ) . '' john and yoko tell people to know the difference between the blessings of peace and the evils of war , to cherish what is morally right and to fight against anything that is morally wrong . the song also expresses hope for a peaceful future beyond the current christmas season . `` happy xmas ( war is over ) '' continues to play on radio stations every christmas season to this day . yes , another amazon reviewer correctly notes that yoko talks a little bit over the very beginning of the song `` oh my love . '' thank goodness that she does n't talk over the lyrics ! a few brief dialogue excerpts from the film are peppered throughout the cd but they never overlap with the songs . the cd ends with the same strength that it started with : `` instant karma ! ( we all shine on ) '' is an excellent song that most lennon fans will always love . the liner notes include some great black and white pictures of john and yoko , including two from the infamous `` bed-in . '' you get the song credits along with the year that each song was released and there is a brief essay by yoko ono herself . overall , this cd is more than just a retrospective of john 's music during a turbulent period in his life . oh sure , almost all of this music has been previously released . however , that 's not relevant here . the cd celebrates lennon 's ability to communicate his political beliefs through his songs . these songs remind us to avoid genocide , to be true to oneself and to strive for peace -- now . i highly recommend this cd for lennon fans , fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how john lennon taught us what was right through his music .
0	there are 2 good songs on this disc , stinkfist and aenema . the rest are pure crap . half of the tracks are n't even songs , they 're just a bunch of noise . no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster . they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $ 14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap . if you gave this cd 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely
1	as a collector of musical scores , i thoroughly enjoyed this selection . it is rated as one of my favorites . but i must warn that if you do not like instramental style music , then this is n't for you . but if you are then this is a must
1	the title says it all , im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time :
1	i am new to ron sexsmith . where have i been ? this cd is outstanding and so soothing ... . the instrumentals are soul syrup , the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries , nuts and fudge sauce ... ..it is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving . i am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before i fall asleep at night and that waking up means i get to hear his `` comfort food '' again ... . this honeymoon will last forever ... . fall in love folks , it 's worth the risk ... .calorie free , i promise ... thanks ron , god speed !
1	if you like post modern lounge music , you will like the tracks on this disc .
0	i 've never been a fan of metallica . i like ride the lightening , master of puppets , and that 's it . that 's the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities . however , if there is one quality i 've always admired in metallica , it is their lyrics . they 've always had excellent lyrics in their songs , and that was what got me to keep buying albums . however , i ca n't credit them for any lyrics on this one . unfortunately , we 're dealing with a bunch of covers . some of the songs are pretty good . the only one i can say i really like is turn the page , though seger 's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it . it 's got decent music , and the vocals are n't bad . metallica just could n't figure out how to honor a classic , and they occasionally sounded like james was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang , leading his voice to sound overly forced . other songs , like killing time , were not spared on this album . unlike with turn the page , metallica did n't even do a halfway decent job covering this . they destroyed a pretty good song . and to be honest , metallica 's guitarist just ca n't compete with sweet savage 's ( vivian campbell ? ? ) . tuesday 's gone was also destroyed . it was too slow and acoustic , but not in the good way it was in the skynyrd original . in this case , james ' voice was terrible . it sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it . that is , at least , the effect i get from it . overall , if you 're a die hard fan , you wo n't like this . it just does n't have what metallica did have for songs back with ride the lightening and master of puppets . if you 're just looking for some metallica , you might as well get this . as long as you are just a small fan , and not a huge one . otherwise , this may come as a dissapointment
0	i picked this up because a ) it 's boz scaggs , a guy whose records i wore out when they first hit , and b ) it 's full of great old songs . but : boz sounds like he 's doing something else , maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window , when he sings . hard to imagine that the man who punched out `` lido '' can sound so half-asleep performing great material . a washed-out , almost depressing performance . there are many much better renditions of these classic songs . i imagine it 's hard to come up with new material , but please , if you 're going to do these songs at least sing as if you 're awake . no emotion , no involvement . and to add annoyance to injury , boz somehow found the world 's worst drummer for this session . if you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him , incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive . pass on this one
1	i discovered this album some years ago as i 'm workin ' in big music stores i 've got the opportunity to listen to so much music ... .well ! ! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays , and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly , blakey and potato are swingin ' so much in those `` salsa like '' rithms mobley is -as usual with art blakey and k.d.- in such a great shape givin ' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays , basically one of greatest blue note of all time !
0	listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years . i remembered all their songs i loved back then . it 's a great homecoming
0	gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great . i just want to point out that the double-cd 'best of ' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price . there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import
1	throb was my introduction to jazz back in '69 or '70 . i have listened to it all of these years on lp then cd , and it never lost its charm . steve swallow was just as nutty then as he is now , `` chickens '' is my favorite cut . the play between electric violinist richard greene and guitarist jerry hahn is a thing of beauty . hahn is still a player who can put just the right note in just the right place ( like that other countrified genius of jazz bill frisell ) , he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle the strings just right to make his musical point . one interesting thing is the organ playing by burton on throb , besides his vibes . the jarrett-burton album also has hahn and swallow , and drummer bill goodwin -- it is very much an album that shows all the new ideas sprouting in music . fortunately , the ideas of that time did not die out , but have continued to grow , making room for all sorts of fusions in jazz , many of which have been remarkable to experience . these two-lps-in-one is like having a superstar album before they became superstars . as i said before , i still play this cd after almost 35 years , and i still get a kick out of it , and still find things that amaze me
1	following the demise of soundgarden in 1997 , everyone was curious what chris cornell would do next . would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different ? he chose the latter . with natasha shneider on keys and alain johannes on guitars , cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily zeppelin and sabbath-rooted musical background , and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record . the result is a very diverse album , highlighting cornell 's immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting . that said , he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments , including tambourine , theremin , and timpani . besides the trademark blues rock-ridden songs that helped cornell make a name for himself , he also digs deep into psychedelia , best heard on `` preaching the end of the world '' , a song that finds cornell opting for thick , radiohead-like arrangements , lofty acoustics , and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects . not too different is `` disappearing one '' , guesting soundgarden drummer matt cameron with its moving vocal melodies , shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition . surely , soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed . but they need to realize euphoria morning was meant to be different way before cornell started working on it . solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands . and considering this , euphoria morning is a huge success . that said , there are still some songs where the band behind cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms , such as `` flutter girl '' and especially `` pillow of your bones '' during the chorus . the former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead ; whereas the latter is more straightforward , employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work . the final song `` steel rain '' is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting , ominous moments . the ethnic drumming ( great tabla rhythms ) on this track is quite experimental given cornell 's music with soundgarden and later on with audioslave . `` follow my way '' and `` when i 'm down '' are the most moving songs , with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath cornell 's heartfelt delivery . this is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre-chorus . similarly , the title track is a passionate piece where cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars . there are no other instruments ; cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out . a remix of the effect-laden `` mission '' would later be included on the mission impossible 2 soundtrack while `` moonchild '' became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song `` ca n't change me '' , perhaps the most modern-sounding , upbeat song on the album . despite being only three minutes though , its flow is majestic , borrowing harmonica , tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second . my european copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song , with french lyrics , accordion , mandolin , and female vocals backing cornell . the song returns to its english chorus at one point , but the rest is all delivered in french and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways . chris cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness . when freed from any band restrictions , the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever .
1	if you like beatles , monkees and the who , then you will like the group that is better than all of them ; the rascals ! `` lonely too long '' is a sad rock pop painful staple in your 60 's elbow ... it hurts ... then theres all this other good sh*** here ... and i do n't mean groovin ! the harmonys and the killer keyboards and tight drumming in these little pop angry yet cheerful nuggets is where its at ! ... i can remember listening to the rascals intermitently with black sabbath and the stooges ... and i realised that above all ... i liked my rascals record the most back in 1987 up in that cold lonely bel air gardening cabode ! also known at times as 'the young rascals ' but to me ... this band will always be the one from way back in childhood that got me listening to queen and the who later on ... ... ..its hard to say that they are underrated since in any given conversation , you realise the rascals get tone of respect and people will take over and talk about them ; five stars ... buy this thing
0	okay , here is the major problem with this release : it is not a tuffgong/island release . the marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time . because bob 's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that american and european recording artists have enjoyed for decades , his recordings have gone onto the cheap market ( flea markets , push carts , gas stations , etc-and now amazon ) . buying one love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the jamaican economy . look closely at the albums before you buy them . find out what label has produced them and try to stick with tuffgong when possible .
1	do i mean the best album or the best singer ? you are correct if you said both ! i saw kristin chenoweth on a pbs show `` broadway 's best at the pops , '' ( though it was not the first time i had heard her ) and decided to check out the offerings here . this is a collection of the kind of music and performances i love . she has a great range , a precise pitch , and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself . in an era when singers try to outdo each other re-interpreting the composer 's original work , not usually with great success , she is a blessing
1	buy this cd now if you do n't have it , it is an instant classic . the beats are banging , and fit cougnut and c-fresh 's lyrics perfectly . the lyrics are tight , and touch on many different things . `` the last breath '' is real life song about death and injustice , and decisions we all have to make in life . `` protect what you hustle fo '' is gangsta , about the individual struggle/hustle . `` tell me something good '' ( remix ) is even better than the west coast bad boyz version with master p. its about real life in the ghetto
0	i bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what i got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out . the guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron ! it 's better than an mfsl disc because the artist approved it ? yeah right ! get real ! i might need a new hi-fi if i do n't like the sound ? please ! you idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does peter mew or rob caiger . thanks for nothing ! sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practices ... saying that the full-length version of `` roll over beethoven '' was used ! what a crock ! and so what if they used the original master tapes ? using a master tape does n't mean anything if you 're going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly ! do n't buy this disc ! hang onto the old us versions , or even better , the japanese issue . do n't give sony your money for this shambles of a product
1	i recently acquired this cd from my local indepedent record store . this is a wonderful cd . there is not much i can say . i am a pianist myself , and it is enlightening to see how this brilliant composer/player plays the piano . his style is completely unique . thelonius monk is one of my favourite jazz artists . i recommend this to anybody who has any interest in jazz
1	wonderful instrumentals and lyrics . a shenandoah lullaby is simply beautiful . i love the way the ending segues into brahm 's lullaby . his version of arkansas traveller is refreshing . teddy bears ' picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard . there ai n't no bugs on me is my two-year-old daughter 's favorite , judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time . i like all the songs on the cd . a breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop .
1	i 'm a huge matchbox fan and i listen to a collection of all 3 albums all day long . i never get tired of it ! rob thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me . his lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me . what a great band ! what a great album ! what a great musical ride !
1	this is a wonderful effort by the del castillo brothers and their band . mark and rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that i have ever heard . i hate that anyone would compare them to the gypsy kings or strunz and farrah , because i believe they ( del castillo ) are far superior . even though i am a huge fan of santana , i think brothers of the castle and vida are more entertaining and satisfying than santana 's last cd . if you are a fan of this genre , you should possess both del castillo cd 's ... ..brothers of the castle and vida . their live show is among the best that i have ever seen
1	while volume 1 of the dream babes series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop , sun-shiney vocals - volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop r , girl group vocals , pop , swinging pop even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little more lyrically serious ( hence the subtitle reflections ) but if anything , that 's a good thing . it 's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys ... and also know - these are not just timepieces to be admired from a distant - these are all still fun , interesting and downright cool to hear again or for the first time . if you 're a collector , this whole series should be on your checklist
1	many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career . for peter gabriel , every album is an experiment . usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm ; however , on gabriel 's fifth experiment , so , the ex-genesis frontman does the exact opposite . gabriel , beloved for always doing something different , decided on this album to play it safe - and for gabriel , that is an experiment . previously he was a sort of cult performer , but on so , gabriel finally made it into the spotlight . big time . so was an immense success , peaking at number one on the billboard top 100 , receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews ( in 2003 , so placed 187th on rolling stone 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time ) , and resulting in a sold-out tour . which brings us to one nagging term : `` sellout '' . though most who loved peter gabriel 's first four albums loved so as well , there are still many who call so gabriel 's sellout album . to me , that 's just foolishness . peter gabriel has never `` sold out '' and i have no doubt that he never will . it 's clear that on so he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction , but that 's probably the biggest experiment gabriel has ever undertaken , save for his subsequent release , passion . one popular theory amongst gabriel fans is that the album 's title , so , is in fact an acronym for `` sell out '' ( hence the uppercase capital `` s '' and the lowercase italicized `` o '' ) . i would n't be surprised at all if it was . so does sound very different from gabriel 's earlier albums ( though then again , none of those sounded alike either ) . if anything , it resembles gabriel 's third self-titled release , nicknamed melt . the thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on so - is a feeling of warmth on that album , unlike the harsh , gritty darkness of melt . perhaps that 's why listeners found so so charming . what does so have to offer ? well , a lot . for one thing , there 's the atmospheric opening , `` red rain '' , one of gabriel 's finest tracks . like many of the tracks on the album , it 's dominated by ethereal guitar from david rhodes and heavenly synthesizers , courtesy of gabriel himself . then there 's one of the biggest hits of 1980s ( which also spawned what may be the best music video in history ) , `` sledgehammer , '' inspired by the motown music gabriel listened to as a child . with its pounding , industrial percussion , playful bass ( by gabriel 's exclusive bass man , tony levin ) and clever , sexually suggestive lyrics , it 's no surprise that `` sledgehammer '' was a hit . after letting his silly side out , gabriel tries to inspire with `` do n't give up '' , a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician , kate bush . the subsequent track , `` that voice again '' , is my personal favorite song from this album . it features some excellent drumming from manu katche , an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like sting , along with misty guitars , delightful synthesizers , and fine lyrics hit home by gabriel 's pained singing . like the best tracks on so , `` that voice again '' manages to be fun , moody , uplifting , powerful , warm , and inspirational , all at once . gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy , powerful `` mercy street '' , a song inspired by and written about anne sexton , an american mental patient who relieved her depression through writing . as on his previous albums , gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out `` big time '' , a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video . `` big time '' features heavy drumming from stewart copeland , the former drummer of the police , as well as some awesome cmi by simon clark . `` we do what we 're told ( miligram 's 37 ) '' is about the experiments of yale professor stanley milgram . milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors , who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible . milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do , despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors . he follows that rather cold song with `` this is the picture ( excellent birds ) '' , a tensely surreal tune . the album closes with one of gabriel 's most famous songs , `` in your eyes '' . most people are familiar with the song from its usage in cameron crowe 's romantic comedy masterpiece ... say anything , where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history . it 's one of gabriel 's warmest and most romantic compositions , and also one of his best . on the original lp version of so , `` we do what we 're told '' closed out the album . that 's a fine way to end it , but it 's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album . when the album was re-released remastered on cd in 2002 , gabriel placed `` in your eyes '' at the end of the album as he originally intended . now that is the way to end it ! so - how does so rank among the many other brilliant works of peter gabriel ? well , it ranks quite highly , actually . it 's one of the pinnacles of gabriel 's career , though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say . after all , how can one compare gabriel 's albums when they are all so vastly different ? certainly , though , so is one of the finest gabriel masterpieces . this is fun , well-crafted , emotional music . so is so wonderful .
1	aretha 's voice , her style , delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable . these songs are more than just classics ; they 're a songbook to millions of people 's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60 's and 70 's as i did . they evolk memories of times that changed our world , and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come . there is not much that came before , and very little that came after these golden years for aretha , that can compare to this treasury of her music . sadly the aretha frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the aretha franklin of this time , who was truly and rightfully the queen of soul .
1	the cd is truly the very best of bobby vee 's works . a delightful cd . even my college age children enjoy the music . really worth the money
0	this is another `` rip-off '' cd . 3 songs and a video , do n't make this a good purchase . i expect a cd to have , at least , 8-10 songs on it .
1	right , so by putting a review down for this album , i am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight , cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long , well too bad that 's not me , i am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music . hawthorne heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others , i have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over , they might even sound gay at some points , although , `` we are so last year '' made me laugh `` i should have known you better , i should blame it on the weather '' wtf is that ? ? ? anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why i 'm giving this 4 and not 5 . but here we 're talking music not lyrics . the music has nothing very special to it and i can play every song on guitar , they often use the same chords except for a few songs `` this is who we are '' , but they have a lot of interesting melodies and do n't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting . even though these chord sequences are often re-used , hawthorne heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses . the other thing i have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band ( behind his guitar ) but also when is a good time to scream and when it is n't . this makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks . hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness . also check out `` where can i stab myslef in the ears '' to see how hawthorne have improved . overall this is a step forward from their last album , it wo n't change the emo scene forever , but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it
1	good singing and good production must i say anything else ? ... ..no get this if you love mixtures of good uptempo and slow rn
0	get off the drugs , guys . your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe . while proficient enough on the instruments and vocals , the moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else . the songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two . right when it seems they might be getting somewhere , they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar , swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes . there is also a curious lack of any decent choruses , here . i have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of the moon . bad idea , guys . and while the music is pretty lame , the lyrics are absolutely wretched . can anyone out there , after listening to this , remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out cd ? if you can , it 's because they 're so lame and uninspiring . the lyrics from the temptations ' `` psychadelic shack '' captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with . here 's a big hint about the musical contents of this cd . it actually says on the front cover , `` featuring david marks of the beach boys . '' huh ? ? ? is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement ? comparing these guys to left banke , the zombies or the beatles is pure blasphemy ! for those of you fortunate enough to not have heard the moon before , count your lucky stars . if you feel yourself slipping to the dark side ( the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars ) and feel like spending some extra cash , there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money , like the aforementioned bands . i 'm probably going to piss some people off with this review , but that 's exactly how i felt after giving this cd a listen . honestly , i immediately thought of george harrison 's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this . i love ya george , but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song . if bad harrison 's your thing ... ... well , then stop reading and buy this cd now ! for the rest of you , there 's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on cd right now . garage or psych , a lot of it is great , but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare . the moon is proof positive . it 's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content ! in closing , while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals , the end product is very bland . i read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of lsd . it shows ! i rated this `` aural adventure '' two stars , instead of one , for two reasons . first , i kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album ( actually two ) . they never did , but at least they performed all original songs . it 's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that does n't have a cover of `` hey joe '' on it . if you 're still with me ( and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare ) , avoid this cd like the plague ! i 'd also like to thank amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists . you done me wrong
0	this is not necessarily an indictment of aimee mann or holiday music ... .though i do find such disks as being cheesey . i was a bit surprised when i heard mann was coming out w/a holiday album . it seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only original material , but non-mainstream music . it has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year . is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with ? there is only so many different ways to cover `` i 'll be home for christmas '' , `` winter wonderland '' - all of which i believe are covered by james taylor , sarah mclachlan and better midler , all of which were released this month . i 'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits . that being said - i still like mann 's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray . `` whatever happened to christmas '' , `` christmastime '' and her original `` calling on mary '' . i also liked the fact that she covered `` you 're a mean one , mr. grinch '' . that seems to suit her more . not my cup of tea - but the songs i mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars
0	no need to say more , these f @ gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they 're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit , and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182 . there just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts
0	yo gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one , i dunno what happpened ... ..the production seemed too generic , the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all , and doesnt carry much replay value ... .to be honest , id pop in a three 6 mafia cd rather than this one ... .album was slacking on so many levels , now theres some tracks that listenable , but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album , nothin special bout it at all ... this album waz overhyped i believe and flopped horribly ... ... .gotti can do much better than this ... ..wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out ... .. 2.5/
0	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today , this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 . right before female rappers ( there 's a few exceptions ) , i hate all little kid rappers . even when i was a kid . i do n't like anything on this album , i still got the tape and it has n't `` krossed '' my mind to even cop the cd . if you like this kind of stuff , or you loved `` jump '' back in the day then i guess this is for you
1	if you have never heard book of shadows by zakk wylde , then you may be suprised by this album . the two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar , and although i 'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion , hm vi contains more . for example , take 'she deserves a free ride ' and the ballad 'fear ' . the piano on this album is superb , haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another . however , there is just enough of past 'metal ' bls in this album - 'crazy or high ' and 'house of doom ' . personal favourites are 'damage is done ' , 'layne ' and 'queen of sorrow ' . there is something more in the solo 's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'stepping stone ' for an example . the musicianship has got even better on this album , with the dodgy drums on 1919 eternal gone , and the bass that was pushed to the background in the blessed hellride is up there with zakk 's playing . this album is deep , moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering blessed hellride . ca n't wait for the new mafia cd to be released .
0	if the name pink floyd was n't on this cd , who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ? i am a pink floyd fan , but i have to say that i do n't like any of their early works . to me , the band begins to make great stuff with `` meddle '' and their first cd were boring , even with the pink floyd name on it . the only good track is `` childhood 's end '' , the other tracks are poor
0	there used to be a time when rap was not synonymous with the likes of hillary duff . no longer is that true , if you call this rap . puff was n't that good to begin with , and i never owned any of his cds but i knew of him ... anyway , by the time i heard he changed his name to pdiddy , i about laughed until i pissed myself . ( ...
1	i would say that this is the closest that cheap trick ever got to making a perfect album . there are only two songs on here that i 'm not one hundred percent crazy about ... the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' on the radio ' , which i think kisses up to radio d.j . 's too much . i love the rest of this . this album was my introduction to cheap trick and i would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them. ' surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite cheap trick song of all time . like most of the rest of the album , it 's heavy , it 's catchy , has great singing and interesting lyrics , and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes. ' auf weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine ... it may be one of the heaviest tunes c.t . has ever done . i particularly love bun e. 's energetic drumming on it . zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune ! another great hard rocker is 'stiff competition ' . of the more pop oriented songs , i would say ' taking me back ' is another personal favorite of mine . probably should have been a hit , dang it ! ' how are you ' shows off the band 's terrific sense of humor ... i particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs ! the other tunes from the first half that i did n't mention are also terrific , particularly ' on top of the world ' . my only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it does n't include the lyrics , which were included on the original lp version . that is but a minor complaint . i do n't think cheap trick ever made another album quite as great as this one .
1	the performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful . this is the kind of material one can expect from deutsche grammophon . wonderful music , a wonderful violinist , wonderful interpretations , and wonderful sound ( not just for its time ) . there are also very few `` squeaks '' and he is almost always right on pitch ! often called definitive , this is the one to get . highly recommended
1	i 'm only giving this 5 stars because the actual recordings are priceless . however i 'm telling you now . do not buy this album this is stolen goods and the recordings that are on this cd are not even of the finest quality . this is purely a commercial album released by the record company without the permission of jack off jill 's members . and thus they recieve no royalties for the selling of this album . fear not though . you can get the tracks off this album completely free and in better quality . agent moulder of jack off jill has remastered and released them on her website for your downloading pleasure . you can find them here : t-c-r.net/jojmusic while you are there check out and support her new band tcr , and their new album 'the chrome recordings ' . singer jessicka also has an amazing new band if you did n't already know . check her and scarling . out at scarling.com god bless jack off jill .
0	this cd is the worst `` comedy '' cd i have ever heard . yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious ? ? ? ? ok , i 've come to the conclusion , the only people writing positive reviews on amazon must be the people trying to sell the junk . i 've seen this guy on some tv shows , and on comedy central , and he 's a somewhat funny guy , but it is painful to listen to this cd . you can feel the awkwardness of the crowd , not knowing if or when to laugh . and it continues throughout the entire cd . there do n't seem to be any jokes on the cd at all . it is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being . do n't believe me ? then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk , and see for yourself . like my review title says , do not read the positive reviews . just read the negative ones , and decide how credible they seem . then make your decision to buy or not buy
1	la pelicula es mas o menos , pero la banda sonora es buena , en especial la cancion # 1 crush de garbage , es una excelente cancion ...
1	the best of taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72 . the albums consisted of two studio albums `` taste '' , `` on the boards , and the two live albums `` live taste '' , and `` live at the isle of wight '' . this band was a power trio led by rory gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career . the band led by gallagher on vocals , guitar ( electric , acoustic , & amp ; slide ) , harmonica , and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock . the music has much in common with cream . however , the richard mccracken and john wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of jack bruce and ginger baker . the undervalued gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of eric clapton . like cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like `` sugar mama '' and `` i feel good '' included here . the music included here is varied . it ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of `` catfish '' to the more acoustic cover of `` leavin ' blues '' . the cuts from `` on the boards '' become more jazzy at times . tracks like `` on the boards '' and `` it 's happenened before , it 'll happen again '' highlight the band 's more improvisational approach . hard hitting tracks like `` eat my words '' spotlight gallagher 's outstanding slide technique . two cuts i miss from this period which are not included here are `` dual carriageway pain '' from `` taste , and `` morning sun '' from `` on the boards '' . the live concert favorite `` sinner boy '' provides a bridge to gallagher 's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album `` rory gallagher '' . this anthology provides a great overview of the early work of irish blues-rock guitar hero rory gallagher and his battered stratocaster . it is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
0	carlos mencia is one edgy comedian ; i know this because he wo n't stop telling everyone about it . i 've never been a huge fan of carlos and after listening to this cd my opinion of him has n't really changed . he claims to be an edgy comedian and that 's his problem , if he was truly edgy he would n't have to constantly remind us in his cd/dvd titles , his show on comedy central , radio/tv interviews and most importantly during his own act . sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does chris rock , george lopez , david cross , george carlin , dave chappelle , richard pryor ( rip ) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it . in fact they are so good at it mr. mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian 's jokes in his own act , a true sign of respect for those who came before them ; at least that 's what carlos seems to think or maybe he 's just plagiarizing because he 's not funny enough to come up with descent material . needless to say i was not laughing while listening to this cd and it was n't because i find carlos to mean spirited , or crass , or politically incorrect ; it 's because everything he talks about that 's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is . there is so much good stand up comedy out there people do n't waste your time and money on this joke stealing , self aggrandizing hack .
1	kudos to harvey fierstein for being so true to the jean poiret play . jerry herman did a wonderful score - my favorite song was `` the best of times '' . gene barry turns out to be a good singer , esp paired with the talented george hearn
1	this record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium . i am partial to good songwriting and bill 's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound . the tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back -it was well worth the trip
0	having watched most , if not all of john waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this album , obviously his name was put to something he had n't quite looked deeply enough in to . talk about misleading . as we all know john waters has a certain reputation for sleaze , trash , camp , kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms , this album had none of this . shame on you john waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis
1	this guy is amazing . i keep playing this for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard anything like it . i even got a huge discount at the auto shop for just having this cd . after the mechanic took my car from the parking lot and listened to one minute of this , he came in and said `` that sounds crazy ! you have to let me copy this '' after getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill , this cd already paid for itself and never collects dust . i know everyone compares clark to aphex twin , boards of canada , and autechre , but for good intentions . he is already that good , after just a few releases
0	this a great priced cd , but the content is why it is so cheap . it 's a true-amateur album . beethoven lover is over her/his head . this is the real world , not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world . deal with it and agree with me . it is n't so great
1	bought this cd for my daughter , a new bill withers fan and she loved the whole collection ! it 's a great compilation of classic bill withers music
0	i was deeply disappointed by the so-called `` return of the funk '' with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup . as compared to herbie hancock 's original `` headhunters '' release , the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient , the grease . this recent release has traded the `` grits and gravy '' created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers , for over-produced smooth jazz-funk , complete with overused n'dea davenport r & amp ; b hooks that left this album flat
0	i 'm a big fan of `` the boss '' , but for the life of me , ca n't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts , and actually `` unplug '' for mtv unplugged . this cd offers no new material that ca n't be found elsewhere , and is basically nothing more than a `` live in concert '' cd that just so happened to be filmed by mtv . this concert took place in 1992 , and you know it 's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on mtv unplugged , and then having to go and plug in . it 's not like bruce does n't know how to play acoustic guitar , because he does . i 'm a big acoustic guitar fan , and for someone of bruce 's talent level , to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect i have for his talent . not what i would consider an essential recording , and not recommended , unless you are such a die-hard `` boss '' fan that you have to own every album he puts out . otherwise , save your money
1	there is a saying in the construction industry `` tripping over dollars to pick up nickels . '' or in the regular world `` ca n't see the black forest for the trees . '' i doubt if there is an definitive rendition of all of beethoven 's symphonies . even the composers own conducted versions changed over time and from performance to performance depending on the players or his intentions . instruments were constantly changing and you know this guy was never satisfied , always stretching . we can only guess what his exact intentions would be today or tomorrow . what you want to remember is : 1 ) the first version of anything you seriously like will color your listenings of subsequent versions . you 'll be listening for qualities that are n't there and missing qualities that are there . 2 ) different versions bring us different views . is n't that a good thing ? sound in all it 's forms is preferable than a useless search for the best sound . i 'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the reviewers here . having said that ... i love these versions . i 've had them for some time . i have at least 4 versions of the symphonies . these are clear , well recorded , dynamic and straight forward . beethoven 's passion , mental range and personal warmth are within . you can easily hear the information that beethoven wanted you to hear . probably better than he could . no make that clearly better than he could . ha ha ! these are solid , lovely , beautiful , and astounding . listen to them
1	sing of mary is a work of art ! the beauty of the music is only surpassed by the woman it praises ... mary ! god bless this cd..
0	the quality of the samples is better than the quality of the recordings .
0	i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert 's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks . admittedly , i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball . so i 'm nostalgic , `` it 's a free country . '' it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels . yet , whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has `` matured , '' i can do nothing but cringe . here 's the flowchart : band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub . - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets `` coached '' in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new `` mature '' album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process . gee , i sure hope this is n't how the end of br5-49 comes about , but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion . this record is ok. of course , i realize that any band ca n't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album , but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl . one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals , and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings . this band live used to be a wild , jittery , moving organism on stage , and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at poor david 's pub in dallas ) , something has settled down . chuck is a great talent , but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett . ok , i 'll go cry me a river , but dammit , just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time . mature ? i just do n't want to grow up that bad
0	i received emails about delaying my order three times . since it showed that the product was available , i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order . i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that , i am not sure how long you will survive
1	i think this my first ep purchase ever - and i generally feel that , despite the quality many offer , eps just are not worth it . sam beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind , as these apparent `` outtakes '' from the creek drank the cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better . i only very recently discovered iron and wine through our endless numbered days , and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong . the standout track to me is the night descending , it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past . the other four tracks are just as excellent though , and i think sam 's managed to make an avid fan out of me . damn ... and just when i thought there were no new artists to be excited about !
1	recorded 2001 - 2002 . it has become all too common that few are taken to task for saying or doing stupid things . what 's worse is that no one seems to care . this is the kind of thing that pisses lewis black off . the angrier he gets the funnier he is . i first came to appreciate mr. black on the comedy central 's `` daily show . '' i always felt that there should have been more time devoted to lewis black . i wanted more - i needed more - i had to have more ! so i went to my `` mental health club , '' amazon.com and bought every title available . the end of the universe , rules of engagement and luther burbank preforming arts center blues - ( i had already purchased the white album ) which one is the best ? all of them ! as i write this review - i realize that i still want more - so i am buying the dvd 's . there is nothing dated about this material . in 2006 it is just as - if not funnier than when first released . please lewis keep recording it still is not enough ! casl
1	if you would have told me last year that i would own an album of piano solos i probably would have laughed in your face . while i enjoy several kinds of music , most of my favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres . the reason i bought this is my wife and i are having a baby in december and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her personal favorite . i bought `` no words '' and `` simple things '' mainly for their absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor . i have been listening to them nearly every night since we received them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the house . it really is amazing music that is very calming and relaxing . he definitely pours everything he has into his piano and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous . everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on as well . i would definitely reccomend not only this cd but jim brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing getaway
0	this album is dull and without any emotion.the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud
1	i would like to point out that mtv rocks is funny and you guys are suckers . this album does rule , just not as much as top40 radio hits
1	brian regan is simply a comedic genius . this cd is especially funny after having seen him live -- you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions ! he has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we 've all said/done/thought . while i too enjoy comedians who are more `` cutting edge '' , i do n't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny . this cd is well worth any price ; check out his dvd and his live show , too
0	i was misled and thought i was buying the entire cd and it contains one song
0	i am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon . trust me , i am not someone who claims to be a music expert , but i am a big fan of jam/funk and jazz fusion . i play bass , i understand music , and umphrey 's is among my favorite bands ( others include 311 , widespread panic , deep banana blackout , red hot chili peppers , soulive , medeski martin wood ) . in general i am open to all kinds of funky music , and umphrey 's usually puts out . in my opinion , this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk ( following the red hot chili peppers and 311 ) . with this album i was expecting them to develop their sound from anchor drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like rhcp 's blood sex sugar magic did , while staying true to their unique roots in jazz , blues , rock and even some metal . like i said , they fuse genres like no one else can ... this album , however , was a complete failure in the areas i have described above . first off , i can understand how reviewers point to the production quality , and the musical talent displayed throughout the album . umphreys mcgee is insanely talented , and no effort could hide that from the listener . however , to be blunt this album is boring as hell , has no funk or rock in it period , and is frankly somewhat depressing . if your expecting wild guitar improv , explosive beats and fun , uplifting music -- ignore this album . if you are a fan of umphrey 's live show and their past albums -- ignore this album . if you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier , jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation -- do not buy this album . the only way i can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album . slow songs without enough music , little variance from song to song , depressing lyrics , and a slow pace . some say this is umphreys showing their full range , i say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable . the only reason i wrote this review is that im amazed by the other reviews on this page . i wish i had never heard this album , it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as umphreys mcgee . they missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation , this album is a step in the wrong direction . i strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music , rather than production quality and introspective lyrics , to steer way clear of this album . this was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release i have ever heard ( including by the way from rhcp , which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to safety in numbers )
1	this is jeff beck 's best album . a masterpiece of guitar work . this is an all instrumental album that features what jeff does best - play guitar . the supporting band is excellent especially the drum work . production quality is excellent as well . while i would n't consider jb a blues guitarist i would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why . a great companion album to blow by blow is wired . it 's a shame that after wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals . he has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to . if you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album . you will not be disappointed
1	this ep is so good , that words can not do it justice . they thought so too and exercised restraint ( no lyrics ) on this album . it is a departure from the previous album from the vapor of gasoline ( which is also a very good album ) in other ways , too , however ; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments . the production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and , thus , their interdependency , whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points ( usually when things started to rock ) . ftvog also had the problem of being a bit monotonous ( of course : in the end , you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings ) . all the suits began to fall off seems to be flawless , however - a well-rounded tour ; very beautiful , bold and particular . try if you like : john fahey , tortoise , june of 44 , sea tiger , etc
1	we really liked the cd of music from the sound track of the movie , elf . it was what we expected and we appreciated getting it promptly since it is christmas music and we we able to enjoy it all through the holiday season .
0	i am very disappointed in this cd . not because the music is n't good , because it is . but because it is just not the pat green that used to play in stillwater . the passionate , soulful pat green . back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved . now he is singing what nashville tells him to . and this coming from the guy who sang `` nashville sucks '' with cory morrow . there are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this cd and it would have sounded exactly the same . but songs like `` southbound 35 '' and `` three day '' can only be sang by pat green . he needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play . will the real pat green please stand up
1	whoa ... this cd rocks , one of my favorite anti-flag albums for sure . this cd may not be what some of the harder punk fans want from anti-flag but i think it also shows they 're growth as a band . they can play more than just really loud hard punk ( though they play that awesome too ! ! ) . some of the songs on this album incredibly powerful , and some are really catchy too . war sucks lets party is a great anarchist anthem , and one trillion dollars is amazingly moving ( i mean , seriously ! 1 trillion $ spent on weapons around the world in 2004 ! ) every track is good and has its own message ! they seem to have no problem coming up w/ new songs ... there are so many things to ridicule in our gov . i just wish that more people would listen to this band 's message . peace and lov
1	evan dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop/punk songs . this album rocks like lovey and is almost as catchy as come on feel . i 've been listening to this album for weeks on end .
0	young jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper ; yet , he is a motivational speaker . so , in this case , he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do . he should just consider himself a rapper ; that way , when he 's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across , we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model . anyways , with that diatribe aside , this album is nothing new from jeezy . we all saw it coming . he picks out some great beats , but can not provide the great lyrics to go along with them . therefore , an uneven album ensues . `` i luv it '' was the first single and is a prime example . if this beat might have reached someone such as t.i . or maybe even a group like clipse , this would 've been a great song . however , it 's jeezy , so it 's gon na be a letdown . that 's pretty much what this album is ; a letdown . after guest spots on `` grew up a screw up '' with ludacris and the posse cut remix `` top back '' with t.i . b.g. , i was expecting alot from jeezy this time around . however , all i got were two tracks ( `` go getta '' with r. kelly `` 3 a.m. '' with timbaland ) that are recommendable . the rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production . if you 're looking for `` inspiration , '' look away from this `` trap-star .
0	most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd 's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering ! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music , just with different chords . in fact , if i was not paying specific attention , i could n't tell when one song ended and another started ! i enjoyed what i heard , but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least , some variety seems to have been called for . disney has always included great music with their movies , running the gamut of musical styles such as classical , jazz , blues , and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high . i do , however , highly recommend mannheim cd 's in general - just not this one
1	as he did with `` parade '' , the soundtrack to his last vanity project `` under the cherry moon '' , prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to `` graffiti bridge '' , which is a hopelessly silly film . no matter . `` graffiti bridge '' , prince 's first album of the 90 's , is also one of prince 's best albums of the 90 's . `` new power generation '' serves as the title track to prince 's new band , and it 's a powerful , funky manifesto . `` the question of u '' is exotic and intoxicating . `` elephants and flowers '' is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption , whereas `` tick tick bang '' is prince at his most joyously raunchy . although most of prince 's material is exceptionally strong here , the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag . `` we can funk '' is a simmering duet between prince and funkmaster george clinton , and tevin campbell provides some youthful exuberance to `` round and round '' . but the tracks by the time mostly fall flat . i 've personally always found morris day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine , and his one trick gets boring quickly . it 's obvious that with `` graffiti bridge '' prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party . but i ca n't help but wonder , without the tracks featuring other artists , if `` graffiti bridge '' would n't be more highly regarded as one of prince 's better albums
1	if you 're a fan of latin music and especially spanish guitar , you will love cafe tropical . every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar , to piano , violin , trumpet , and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments . every time i put this cd on i hear new things , which i find makes for an even more enjoyable listen . as usual , johannes linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre , and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself . highly recommended
1	a great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the american music library . ofcourse the originally withdrawn [ w. new at-the-time funky people ] `` talkin ' loud.. '' by jb ( i bought it retail ! ) is the highlight , along with the live `` it 's my thing ... '' by marva whitney . ( yes , i saw mw sing it **l-i-v-e** at madison square garden in july , 1969 ) . the prev . unrel . bobby byrd track and vicki anderson 's contribution to the `` cold sweat '' session also reinforce the value for listeners
0	i live in buffalo and i 'm a big prog rock fan ; so when i saw this cd at the library , i knew i had to give it a free listen . but make no mistake - this cd under-delivers on many levels . i always wanted asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player ( steve howe ) , a top-shelf drummer ( carl palmer ) , and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task ( john wetton ) . but there was always a bit too much `` pop '' , simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me . hey , progressive rock is mostly about `` different '' , complexity and change , right ? asia was a progressive-pop band ( akin to the later albums of todd rundgren 's utopia ) that made good music , but did n't really pioneer much of anything . same with this cd . there 's little here that 's new or better than the studio versions of the songs . palmer 's long drum solo got boring after a while . steve 's acoustic solos can be found on other yes recordings , and done much better there - here , the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he 's playing tuned rubber bands at times . ( honestly , i remember hearing better fidelity from my old kenner close'n'play ! ) o.k. , it was cool to hear steve express his pleasure at playing in buffalo again ! but the so-called `` keyboard solo '' by geoff downs was underwhelming to say the least , and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos . i guess if one loves a band too much , they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any cd by that band , and that 's just fine for those people . however , the objective reality of this cd 's value comes creeping in on many other 's existing reviews : namely , the production quality is sub-par ( to the point of being annoying at times ) ; the vocals and harmonies are often off-key ( you really should n't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music ! ) ; this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason ; the packaging and liner notes are scant ; and the performance just does n't add much to the studio versions . this is for asia completists only . asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop cd with their first studio album . i love it . but they never improved upon it , and never stretched out into new territory . perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from `` good '' to `` great '' . support your local library . ( and in this case , save some cash ! )
1	one of his best times . all the songs on this cd are great he express his fellings very openly . with this cd people can really see who marc anthony really is
1	this is a fantastic album . the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release ( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything ) should speak volumes . i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it . i am a pretty constant consumer of new music . get this cd - you wo n't regret it ! ( ps i 've never done an amazon review before , but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me ) . it is melodic , catchy , uplifting and cheeky - in short , a little piece of musical bliss .
1	this cd is supberb ! ! absolutely fabulous . i received it timely and have enjoyed listening to it over and over again . all my deslings with amazon thusfar have been outstanding . thanks , amazon laura rig
0	i own all of bebo norman 's cds , and i love all of them , except for this one . i bought it and listened to it once , and i hated it . it does not sound like bebo . this sounds like steven curtis chapman or michael w. smith or any of the other mass produced christian/pop music artists . on all of his previous albums , even though he changed his sound slightly , it was still generally very acoustic and bebo-ish . this album sounds nothing like his previous music . i was disappointed .
1	i purchased my first weill recordings in 1960 , the off-broadway threepenny opera , and lenya 's berlin theater songs . i have treasured them all my life . lenya was , of course , incomparable , but ute lemper carries on her special genius . this new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece . john mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even klemperer missed in his masterful kleine dreigroschenmusik . every member of the cast , even the bit roles , is perfect in the characterization . kollo is the first performer since harald paulsen ( the origninal mackie messer ) to bring all of the tradition of viennese operetta to this music . he is a miracle . macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from paulsen . most noteworthy is the jenny of milva . two delightful bonuses in the recording : a reprise in act 2 of seerauber jenny by milva ( the jenny ) and the inclusion of lucy brown 's aria after the jealousy duet . there is brief dialog before most pieces which adds a dramatic integrity to the recording . i can not find high enough praise for this new treasure
1	i have been a fan since valotte . and i like the other reviewers here , ca n't believe why this cd did n't receive the airplay it deserves ! there must have been some politics in there , with sean 's cd coming out on the same day ( yoko ? ) it is one of those cds that you just leave on and you do n't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you do n't like ! i love every song ! ! especially `` day after day '' , '' i should have known '' , `` i do n't want to know '' and my fav right now `` cold '' .. i hope that what i have heard is true that he is working on his latest now . ca n't wait ! buy this cd.. you wo n't regret it
1	i 've been listening to satoshi tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best cd 's yet . its one of those cd 's that is a must have before a road trip . just play it and let it ride . from beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit . before you know it your at the end , but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again .
0	as you might think , i am not a die hard fan of jmj , i think that when only die hard fans rates an album , it makes you think that with such a high rating , everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth . not everybody like this king of musical experimentation , some do but some do n't ... i like oxygene and equinoxe , and even after all those years , they are still good to listen too . rendez vous offers some really good moments , but we are far from the perfection as oxygene or equinoxe . rendez-vous is easier to get use to that zoolook is , but we are far from a near perfect album . that 's all
1	this talented woman can sing anything . i really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work . renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose . hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - cassandra wilson , nancy wilson , regina belle , sarah vaughan , etc . this cd of different musical styles reminds me of nina simone and cassandra wilson , two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special . i loved all the songs and the standouts here are `` haunted heart '' , `` river '' , `` my one and only love '' , `` my cherie amour '' , `` cancao do amor '' , and beatles `` in my life '' , and `` hard times come again no more '' . i hope renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because i 'll certainly always listen
0	this album sounds to much like pop music than hardcore reggaeton . they even have that rbd boyband in this piece . a few years ago lt saved reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even grandmas like and that is scary . the only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel de la ghetto songs . if you wan na hear some real reggaeton look for producers like dj memo , meka , mambo kings , dj wassie dj fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin reggaeton calle my friend
0	almost 10 years later ... and i am still waiting for the punchline . i think this is the most properly named album of all time ... as the easiest summation is : it lacks any punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes ! its terrible , especially when contrasted with pornograffitti . gone are the great guitar tone , riffing , rhythm , power , and groove that marked most of the prior three albums . it 's what the forth side to `` iii sides to every story '' could have been ... `` yours , mine , the truth , and the suck '' . the songs are lackluster , but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album . `` no respect '' , surprisingly , by name , is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album . `` waiting for the punchline '' still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time ... i dont write negative reviews unless a cd is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work . in this case , it fits both ... its bad for extreme ... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands ' albums as well . conversely , in my opinion , iii sides and pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums , respectively
1	this cd is a confusing mix of punk bands , from pop-punk 's sum 41 & amp ; good charlotte to punk favorites alkaline trio , vandetta red , & amp ; the casualties to bands that i 've never even heard of such as unsung zeros , ozma , & amp ; destruction made simple . i reccomend this cd if you 're looking for new bands to like & amp ; listen to . although it 's a confusing cd , it gives you new ideas of just how deep you 're going to go in the punk underground
1	i was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between sammy , roth and evh ! i honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers . i just downloaded this off of itunes and i can tell u folks , every track is amazing ! its like when lars ( metallica ) said once : `` i was always amazed with g '' ... if i may borrow this line , i had always heard of the great evh vs. hagar vs roth but honestly never appreciated this guitar work before today ! evh is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists . my brother in law was debating with us about slash , sammy , evh , and edge ( u2 ) , clapton and apparently they all chose evh . i did n't believe it till i heard it ! evh is an inspiration . anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in evh 's history , should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds evh has been to and in !
1	this is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic . lyrical wizardry was the order of the day , if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic . the production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other . buy this ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	bread8 , that 's one of the stupidest comments i 've ever read . you do n't know s*** about metal . you ca n't handle the intensity of real metal because you 're a fat virgin who 'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like `` immortal rites '' and `` pleasure to kill . '' leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f @ ggot . anyway , `` dysfunction is better than staind 's other stuff , but only by a microscopic margin . aaron lewis is a weak , talentless crybaby whose bandmates could n't make a good song to save their lives . every song on here is full of bogus `` pain '' and `` depression '' coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band . if you want heavy music that 's accessible for the masses , go for rage against the machine ( except for `` evil empire '' ) , faith no more , helmet , living colour , and quicksand .
1	i was in walmart 's electronic area ( which is where you can usually find me ! ) and i saw the album . i heard unbelieveable and i was sold on that song but could n't find the single . the album on first listen was not my favorite , but after a while i started liking it . it is a great album and i 'm glad i bought it . talent is a virtue !
0	triple h ( as fed up ) : i love britney , she is so pretty and nice and so on . shawn michaels ( as hellraiser ) : anyone who hates her are just jealous ! triple h : well , we got some news , britney is nothing but an ugly redneck piece of trailer trash . shawn michaels : this no-talent hack is a washed up skank whose career sank . triple h : this chick is a skank , unlike my wife stephanie mcmahon who looked good whilst carrying my first child ( i just had a daughter ) . shawn michaels : britard on the other hand is one ugly airbrushed , lying hypocrite . d-generation x says if you are not down with dx and you choose to be down with britney and her blind sheep fans , we got two words for ya ( crowd yells s*ck it )
1	this cd has all of the cuts that you remember from back in the day ... you will love it ... it is always in my car
0	imagine buying this cd after seeing `` the mirror has two faces '' fully expecting the soundtrack music to the movie , and reading overall great reviews on amazon . imagine the shock of receiving the cd and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - the remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse . perhaps barbara , with her tremendous unlimited wealth , felt she would be giving away a `` free album '' to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film . shameless misrepresentation
1	in temporary secretary theres a great melody struggling to escape from the space invaders backing.memo to paul-turn this into a ballad for your next album bogey music , inspired by a book , is quite interesting . waterfalls is the standout song and comin'up was the hit . the rest you just get used to what more could you ask
1	like many amazon reviewers , i play a teensy bit of guitar . i know just enough to know how incredible these guys are . this is the best , most exciting acoustic playing i 've heard since al dimeola cut `` race with devil on spanish highway '' on his elegant gypsy suite lp . watching the del castillo brothers shred on the dvd part of this set will assure that i do n't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time . since robert rodriguez ( desperado , spy kids , etc ) filmed the performances , we get appallingly good , tight shots of the fretwork . people , it ca n't be done . i will henceforth concentrate on harmonica , and try to forget that sugar blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument . the songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional latin , mexicano perspective , but the overall sound is more like santana when carlos goes acoustic . the `` hidden track '' on the cd most overtly shows that the del castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the latin roots music . this is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys latin music or great guitar work of any style , but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out . the quality of music here really transcends the genre
1	there are some amazing moments on this record . i find myself freaking out to three songs in a row , and waiting for the fourth song to end . the de la collaboration is weak ; it 's got the great wild-style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious . some of the more r tracks fall flat in my opinion .
0	i 'm a `` compleat '' beatlemaniac , and i do n't mind the political statements at all , but this is a nearly unlistenable record that i have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album . i would have loved it if it had been a 7 '' single , `` woman is the nigger of the world , '' with the rest of it just words written in liner notes . after that opening track , the remainder is a serious chore to get through . it 's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent `` imagine '' ( 1971 ) and the solid `` mind games '' ( 1973 ) , but then again , john was not consistent , in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star . love john for the genius he was , his commitment to peace , and the great music he made -- it 's just that there 's barely any of it on this particular record .
1	one of the greatest rap albums of all time . wicked backgrounds and rhyming
0	in answer to a music fan from temple hills , the song was called king holiday by the king dream chorus & amp ; holiday crew . it came out on mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned . it made no.30 on the r & amp ; b charts but did n't crossover pop . the lyrics are on the net ( try google ) but i do n't know if the song still is
1	i had originally heard `` drive away '' on a radio station and i was instantly blown away . upon seeing the music video for it , i decided to buy the cd . i was hardly disappointed . the emotion that goes into the cd is amazing and it 's definitly a cd to sit down and enjoy . i saw the band in concert and met jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was . give gratitude a chance and you wo n't be disappointed .
0	trash , and irrated plus the good albums ya 'll give them 0 's . so now i'ma let the world know
0	sinceramente , no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas , incluso renombrados artistas , hacia este musico ... ungido de la leyenda grape , amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura , esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima , piedad , curiosidad ... no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson ( 13th ... .. ) .. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin , son opiniones , nada mas .
0	i liked this when it first came out b/c i was 16 . i was a rebel , wanted to be part of something different . this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while . favorite song is mongoloid ... totally strange but rocking song . `` uncontrollable urge '' rocks ( in a weird way ) and come back johnny is almost a conventional song . satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song . the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss , multi media , making money kind of thing . i saw them live ( they were horrible ) during their hey day . the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream , devo is still as odd of a group as ever . mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work ( rugrats ) and you can hear the devo in all of his work . anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is . devo came out as a goof , not as serious musicians . they got big in the 70 's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids ( like me ) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own .
1	this is the first of alison 's album 's that i bought , many years ago ... ..i 've watched her career blossom ... ..she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon , it 's her best ! true bluegrass , beautiful voice , wonderful music ! i 've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed
1	first up i give this album a 4.5/5 for the fac that it has real hiphop beats and good lyrics . real hiphop , they stayed true to the sound . i just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest tcq fan and of that style . but all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album . tracks like `` keep it movin '' , `` hot sex '' have ill beats . this album does have a real jazzy sound to it , which im not the biggest fan of , but its more of a unique style , and they deserve props for trying new styles . so overall this is a really good album , and worth getting . my top 5 songs 1.buggin out 2.hot sex 3.oh my god 4.luck of lucien 5.keep it movi
1	there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album . one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time . it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track . in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology . the remaster is splendid . another good reason is the great bonus tracks . almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store . can you dig it
0	i do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars . his voice is so mediocre that i am suprised he manages to sell many cd 's at all . i would n't waste my hard earned cash on this guy . stick with sinatra and get the best . if not , and you want someone who can sing sinatra style , then i would recommend you listen to the young canadian , michael buble . in my opinion michael buble is a much better singer that tyrell . he can swing and do justice to that genre of music
1	this is the type of music to sit down , relax , put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious . from spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion ... this is just a taste of what is supersilent , and from what i hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off . all this coming from someone who has never heard them before ... talk about a great buy ! highly , highly recommended , i close my eyes , to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body , drunk with the infinite beauty , i sigh without a mouth and think..
1	anyone who had access to a radio in the 80 's would know at least two songs by missing persons . their fun music and amazing flare ( dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great ! ) make this a good party album . i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great . just as an added note , warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran ( my personal favorite band ) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986 ! !
0	i know , i know - i never thought it possible either , that gwen stefani could produce something more awful than anything her ( ex ? ) band no doubt and reduced to house-husband gavin rosdale 's band bush ever could combined . take no doubt 's attempts at reggae , their use of guitars and trumpets ( together ? never good ) , take.. well , every bush song ever recorded and `` hollaback girl '' is still a hundred times worse . let 's talk about why . first of all , that fake music thing i hate . if you 've read any of my previous reviews ( and if not , why not ? ) you 'll know that if someone is singing something , even if they 've written it or not , you 've got to believe it . i mean , aretha franklin did n't write `` respect '' ( otis redding did ) , but when she sings it - you believe it . not so with this , a laughable attempt at a football-chant soundalike . here , gwen tells us that `` uh-huh , this my s**t '' and `` this s**t is bananas '' . and then helpfully spells out bananas , all under a `` hey mickey '' type repetitive drumbeat . gwen attempts to sound a number of things.. a ) 17 b ) black c ) `` street '' d ) like she had any idea what the hell a `` hollaback girl '' actually was until someone told her a week before the song was written . she fails on all accounts . what she does come across as being is everything that , well , she is . a white , 35 year old rich married woman bringing in expensive young talent to help her sell albums . it 's not only an unconvinving song , but a crass , ugly , tedious noise . but it has the word `` s**t '' repeated loads and loads of times , so of course it sold by the bucketload . sigh and double sigh . i shudder to think what she 'll come up with next to top it . gwen gangsta rap ? the_curmudgeon_hates_you @ yahoo.co.u
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo , was cast very well , its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 , and the sisters , even though they were n't the leads , they all had such great songs , especially beth , whose song , `` some things are meant to be '' always brings tears to my eyes , its just so touching . i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr
0	this is no saw 85-92 as some people compare it to . oh , no . this is a largely unfulfilling listen . the tracks all sound too similar . i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear , but the drum programming and harmonic `` development '' is lackluster . only track worth burping over is the last one ... xmd something . has he been taking piano lessons since druqks ? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch , check out nick forte 's new release `` young man 's disease '' which is better than anything else i 've heard this year .
0	i was , overall , disappointed by this cd . there are many good reviews here , but they generally overpraise . tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears . a major highlight is track 9 , the crab and the egret , but interestingly , the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous chinese percussion . disappointingly , the cd is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment
0	somehow not up to her earlier work . the instrumental accompaniment is good , but tends to dominate at the expense of cesaria 's voice and the songs do n't strike me as particularly memorable . one reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she 's done . if so , i just do n't see it . i was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her . i hope not
0	best of dark horse is another half-hearted attempt to gather george harrison 's greatest songs together . this time we only get tracks from 1976 to 1989 . while there are some good songs ( blow away , crackerbox palace , cheer down , etc . ) the rest do n't represent his best songs from this period . where 's faster , this is love , someplace else , etc ? the only reasons to purchase this cd are for the rarities poor little girl , cockamamie business and cheer down . until they make a true best of , we 'll have to make our own single-disc compilation . here are the tracks needed : apple scruffs , my sweet lord , all things must pass , what is life , give me love ( give me peace on earth ) , living in the material world , crackerbox palace , blow away , all those years ago , dream away , cloud 9 , this is love , someplace else , got my mind set on you , end of the line , handle with care , cheer down , devil 's been busy , any road , rising sun .

0	robin gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the 1960s . with the bee gees or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show . however , in this live recording he chooses to recreate mostly bee gees hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies . thus he needs the help of another lead singer , chorus and the neue philharmonie frankfurt orchestra . but everything goes wrong here : robin 's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music ; the lead singer ( no list of credits ) is a poor substitute to barry gibb 's famous falsetto ; the female voices are not very inspired , to say the least ; while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy ( the winds on juliet are really unbearable ) . post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is chaotic . lines notes by experts andrew mon hughes and ann grootjans are interesting and illustrative , but they seem to belong to another album . the message from robin gibb seems to be clear : `` i can do it all by myself '' . well , he can not . he should re listen to one night only ( 1998 ) and check for sound , harmonies and production
0	i said i was going to be honest in all reviews , and yes , i kinda clunkered on this one . i hate this cd . simply put . they ca n't sing , and the songs are boring . i 'm sorry i bought this cd , and other people might not like me saying that , but it 's my opinion . i listen to power metal extensively and there is much better stuff out there like symphony x , nightwish or sonata artica . do n't buy this , though , you might like it . i 'd definitely listen to it first
0	is it really necessary to take minute-long solos in every song ? really ? if you like your solos long-winded and lacking in destination , and your lyrics trite ( get a job ? ? ? ) , check these guys out . if you actually plan on listening to the music you buy , skip it
0	perhaps puffy only got as far as he could riding on biggie 's legacy , but lets face it , he really has very little talent , charisma , charm and just seems so dull , he is basically a male paris hilton , going around acting like the world 's biggest d1ck ny saying `` look people , i got money , arent i cool '' besides biggie ( rip ) , bad boy really is not great , most of the artists are poor quality , the production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial . this album is basically not even worth printing or existing . it is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on tv . i do n't know why people like tupac , biggie , dimebag , chuck shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths . so i would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and d4l deserve , a 1 star rating .
0	collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage . the main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers ! its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans . i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again
0	guys ... it 's not that good . i have the album on my computer , and i gave it a few listens , but ... it has no substance . it 's not interesting or anything new . it 's catchy . and irritating , after more than a song or two . that 's all ( `` bandages '' is enjoyable once in a while , i will concede ) . if you 're looking for catchy and poppy ( and there 's nothing wrong with that ) , then buy it . if you want something new and original - do n't . and if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like the faint , the bravery , or le tigre .
1	call it american folk , call it alt.country , call it what you like , but if you heard this aussie trio on cbs or npr earlier this week , suffice to say their in a category all their own . love that harmonica . up all night by the waifs is appropriately titled . i 'll be up all night listening to it
0	i have *not* listened to this album in full . i am , however , completely turned off by the fidelity of all the samples i have just listened to . there 's no excuse for an album sounding that bad in '69 . ghad , there was zeppelin , hendrix , clapton , miles - who recorded this thing ? all musicians on this cd are superlative examples of their mastery of their instruments , but the above reviewers in general are correct . holdsworth made lifetime along with tony william 's kick-ass drumming , and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was , and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a bootleg . personally , i 'd regard this as something a collector should have - it 's for a devotee , not for someone trying to access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct . it 's like dylan looking for his `` girl from the north country '' , or `` knocking on heaven 's door '' . at least they let tony williams in so he would n't sing any more ! all gags aside , a dissapointing effort . overpriced , but one to have if you are a collector . you have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become holdsworth 's version of lifetime , which i have not forgotten for 30 plus years . a quantum difference in fidelity , and quality of music . i 'd rather buy tony william 's lifetime collection if i had to make the choice . i 'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to peer if i was desperate ... very unimpressed
1	i have been a fan for jaci velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages . i do not speak spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less . this album lived up to the velasquez name in my book- my family and i only really enjoy the traditional sounding christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions . jaci 's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my christmas traditions ! overall i love this album and the only reason i did not give it a full five stars was that i am done with that chipmunk song . sorry everybody .
0	as far as drum and bass cds go this cd was terrible very boring and anything with clever on the cover im going to stay far away from nuff said
0	as if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough , its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound . this band sounds like a even more flaccid killswitch engage , a hawthorne heights/silverstein with downtuned guitars . as if it wasnt an abomination already , they even sing about vampires . yes , thats right , vampires . and you couldnt get any g*yer .
0	reba is not country anymore period ! ! this cd will prove that . just listen to the first track which i think is horrible . as a matter of fact i think the whole cd is horrible . not deserving of reba 's talent .
1	no doubt about it , from start to finish , this is a classic for anybody 's collection . i can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today . this was rap music at it 's best from spice 1 to dj quik . there will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods . so add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap , west coast fan ( like myself ) , or just want to hear a great soundtrack
1	this truly is a masterpiece of pop music . there is not a wasted moment . the songs all blend together majestically one after the other . you really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect . i agree with the reviewer that stated that 'do n't look back ' is one of the best songs i have ever heard . i told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays . i do n't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart . i had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive .
0	i admit to being curious about rihanna 's music because like a previous poster from brooklyn stated `` i was not trying to become a rihanna fan ! ! '' . i was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although rihanna is no vocal powerhouse , the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs . i really loved her lead single , pon de replay and since i do n't listen to the radio , it never grew old to me because i heard it so infrequently . it 's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats fun lyrics . the other standout tracks to me are : here i go again - like the island beats of the music and again , her vocals are utilized well on the track willing to wait - more of a straight r track with great beats that again , work well with her vocals let me - has an interesting `` go-go '' beat mixed with a middle eastern sound rush - again , a great dance track it 's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production , ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist : the last time - rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and now i know - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty , this song would 've been a big hit for a stronger singer . honestly , i 'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about rihanna 's music and to those who like ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as `` artists '' . they are able to produce enjoyable singles ( through the magic of protools ) but do n't do much in the way of live vocal performances
0	while well produced , i was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings . frankie laine still sounds great - but it just was n't the same . i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album , but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly ( and in a couple of cases very ) , different in tempo and vocal inflection - it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different , much slower , with vocal emphasis changed . i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time , but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp
1	i read about lila downs ' new cd , la cantina , in victor cruz- lugo 's article entitled , `` sweet sorrow , '' published in the june-july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine ( page 76 ) . it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs ' new cd , la cantina : 1 . the cd cover is awesome , a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock . it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time , awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song . 2 . each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila 's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family . 3 . i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera 's legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000 . juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice . later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i 've been a fan of her work ever since . 4 . this new cd is indeed a delightful experience . i appreciate that she moved into the corrido , son , etc . genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more . it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious . it 's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity . i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila 's work . she is a true artist . i 've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds , however , this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience . 5 . i am very impressed with lila 's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000 . there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon . ahua ! her solos in `` yo ya me voy , '' have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity . as victor cruz-lugo writes , `` through it all , downs ' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart , tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same . '' this is my favorite of lila 's repertoire . it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed . enjoy !
0	wen i bouht dis cd i thought is waz my holmes on it but it was jus sum dude wid a big azz hoodie and hat . when i put dis in my playa it was broken the rappers , main peter , voice sounded liek a blender . dah turntables sound like my moms bong a bubblin damn nigga was my favorite track but that was n't on dis cd . i wish i had da real copy and not da malufunked up one . peace out dawg keep it real and stay won wid dah underdawgzz
0	this album is way overated , let me tell you why . wack mc : mf doom is a bad rapper , not the worst , just bad . he can flow but his rymes are weak , corny , and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all . the corniest ryme i heard was- `` we rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul than a sock with a hole . '' lmao ! it gets worse `` take it from the tec-9 holder/ they bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola '' what is he talking about ? ? ? he is not a genius mc , nas is , he is even worse than aesop rock . which they rap with words and dont even make any sense . filler : this cd has too much filler , they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs . some of them is not even neccasary . average beats : the beats are either average or just sucks . i can make better beats on fruity loops . however track 22 `` rhinestone cowboy '' had the best beat on the entire album . the beat was hot to tell you the truth , but that only gives it one star . overall this album sucks , just download `` rhinestone cowboy '' and call it a day . i think madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here . i dont recommend this album , if you want a good album get mos def `` black on both sides '' it 10x better than this
1	all of the isleys early work without the younger isleys is just as good with them . but these early workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented . ron isley has a way of making country , and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded . not too many black artists can do that . to get a taste of the `` real isleys '' before the `` mr. biggs '' persona , get this with `` get into something '' , and `` givin ' it back
0	this was for a friend and i have no feedbac
0	this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work . frankly , it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators . some of the craig chaquico-style stuff was interesting , but better left to craig . try 7th heaven , mosaico or guitar odyssey instead
0	while i like some of these songs , i can not understand a single word he sings . i even heard him interviewed and i did n't understand a word . when he sings , he spends all the time looking down , so you ca n't even lip read . i do n't think he has stage presence and i think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who ca n't form words . he does n't sing clearly and i just ca n't get into his music completely . i think i 'll stick to r
1	so , incubus rocks no matter who you are or which of their albums is your favorite . plainly put , this album was not my favorite of theirs . it 's good . it 's really good . but if you 're expecting incubus good , you 'll be slightly disappointed
0	while filled with talented performers , this cd sucks . rocky is a campy , 1970 's b-movie , that 's what makes it enjoyable . even as a stage show it 's a hokey , rock-and-roll extravaganza . this cd tries to turn rocky into thoroughly modern millie , and it just does n't work . the corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make rocky..rocky . this cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original roxy cast . and lastly , tim curry is frank . his rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the frank on this album . ripley is a little too legit for janet , and the female eddie weirds me out . buy the roxy cast . it 's so superior it 's almost laughable .
1	mr. kimbrough done come thru with the dirt on this one . this aint just blues music , it 's soul music right in there with isaac hayes and nem . it 's hard played and honest and that 's the true pleasure of it
1	gerry beckley is `` timeless '' . his new cd is awesome and seems to go back to his roots . his songs over the years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.this new cd just proves he hasnt lost his touch . anyone who does not agree , doesnt know the real gerry . i have had the privilege to meet him and talk with him many times , including being able to celebrate new years eve with them after a concert with the rest of america and their families.he is one of the nicest people i have ever met , and his songs have always been a part of my life . i hope there are still many more cd 's still to come and look forward to seeing him again in the near future in concert and afterwards
1	i bought this because i thought this cd would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about . i love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from china loves this cd and will request it `` chinese flute '' please . this is just one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different kinds of music beyond the wiggles lilo stitch cd . i would have liked to have had more information on the songs like what province of china . but not having this information really does not lessen the rating of 5 stars ! our family thinks this is an excellent cd
1	how dare you compare oasis to phil collins . phil collins sucks and oasis rules ! how come you do n't get the message ? you 're retarded
1	i saw the outlaws live twice in the early eighties and had a great time at both shows . this album is just plain fun to listen to and brings back some very fond memories
0	i was very disappointed with this volume . the past 2 volumes had great retro/loungy mixes and this new one is too repetitive and clubby . i was excited to see the postal service doing a mix , however it sounded just like any of their other songs . this cd sucks .
0	i think they should place a disclaimer at the top advising would be buyers that rosemary clooney does not perform on this cd . it lacks the romance and magic without her . i wish i had read the reviews of this cd before purchasing it , but i was so excited to see the white christmas soundtrack on cd that i just one-clicked it
1	this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded . damien 's vocal range is vast ; his musicianship excellent ; but it 's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists . haunting , sensitive , flowing , crashing ... ( if i have one criticism , it 's the mixing levels - at times , his vocals are drowned . in concert , when he lets rip , you really feel the power of his vocals/music , which , unfortunately , does n't come over quite as well on the album . ) a truly magical album .
0	right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i 've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing , half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks ... do n't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble
0	the 4 cd mini gibson amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78 , and lp 'harder-to-get ' charlie christian/benny goodman recordings . legacy states `` master takes '' , but absolutely fails to research deep into charlie christian 's recording history . columbia vinyl 2lp 30779 , ( 1972 ) , and columbia 78rpm c -102 along with the columbia `` sextet '' cds leave legacy far behind . the wang wang blues -78rpm is n't in the 4cd set , and there are far too many 'false-starts ' , which benny goodman discarded for a good reason . star dust is only about 3 minutes , it 's 8 minutes on vinyl . there is even in-studio handclapping after some tunes . i have the 78s , many col. lps , and there is no `` studio-live '' takes . this 4 cd box could have , and should have been much better in information , content and genuine charlie christian guitar stylings . the 2 readily available bg sextet cds are a better purchase idea , but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl lp tracks , which are `` the master takes '' , left off the legacy/sony box set . musicologist 's suggestion , try to get the vinyl lps . skip this misleading 4 cd set of various tracks , + handclapping = not `` good enough to keep '' , ( airmail special ) . try the 2 benny goodman/charlie christian columbia cds , amazon has both , and most of the benny goodman sextet 'takes ' are master takes , and `` good enough to keep !
0	i felt like i was taking a piss on myself the whole time i listened to this album . what happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1 , 2pac , and mc breed ? this clone of 40 raps with the likes of lil jon ( wack as hell ) , washed up 80 year old too short , and a bunch of losers i have never heard of . the album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk . and they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called `` album '' . e-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called `` hyphy '' in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career . the album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere . e-40 would n't know lyrical content if i slapped him with a krs-one cd . this cd is wack simple and plain , pee-40 is a beat waster , and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars ! !
1	i supposed i should not have been watching this movie when i was nine years old , but i remember seeing it several times via hbo . more importantly , my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over over in the car . the songs stuck with me for years , and every know and then i 'll hear something out of context and i 'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family . it 's something that i wo n't think about for ages , but when i 'm reminded of it , i ca n't believe i do n't still have a copy of the soundtrack . i remember it had quiet and comforting songs mixed in with songs you could sing along too . it 's perfect for driving and just having on in the background
0	hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world , and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums . the only dofference is that they have gotten worse . i write this review to the two groups of people out there : the exisiting hammerfall fans , and those trying them out for the first time . for already existing hammerfall fans such as myslef , i strongly urge that you do not buy this cd , unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon . for those looking to try hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time , go ahead and get this one , because hammerfall are by no means bad musicians . they can all play very well , but this cd lacks refinement and creativity . start here and work your way up to the better hammerfall , which you will no doubt appreciate more . hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over , if you know what i mean . all of their songs sound relatively similar , but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career
1	a friend loaned me her cd and i absolutely loved it ... ... but i could not purchase it anywhere ... ..my daughter suggested i contact you ... ..results , results ! ! ! ! thank you ! a most outstanding seasonal soft listening cd
0	this is a pep rally on cd ; an unsingable , emotionally charged pep rally . it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music . the melodies are not easily singable at all , and the songs use all the same musical cliches . this is worship manipulation at it 's best . if you read the words to learn something concrete about god , you will find nothing of substance . they talk about actions to give god and our response to god , but no meat-and-potatoes of why we should be doing this . god is great , but why ? this is very disturbing , and completely unacceptable for congregational worship .
1	when i bought this i played it on repeat for about 45 hours . different versions than on the album ( i think it 's their demo ) . this version of modern age is amazing . definitely worth buying
1	the ufo space travel theme of astonomy domine is continued on let there be more light saucerful of secrets and set the controls . rick wrights two songs are real good remember a day is one of the best on here . seesaw has interesting percusson . corporal clegg floyds first ww2 song is upbeat syds song jugband blues is one of the best early pink floyd songs.saucerful of secerets is a good early pink floyd cd it is an important part of pink floyds history .
0	thankfully i checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it . i felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it . i made it through the cd once with my kids , but that was it . we will not be listening again . as others have said , go buy the radio disney cds ( or possibly later version of kidzbop if they come with better reviews ) . the singers ( kids and adults ! ) on kidzbob are out of tune and just painful to listen to .
0	reviewgium - volume i , issue xvii over sixty and still going strong , neil young has released a new album , largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on u.s. president george w. bush . as opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet , country-tinged effort , living with war is a pretty much straightforward rock album , mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks , as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks . musically , it 's nothing spectacular , in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula , and there are really no diversions from the grunge-like rhythm guitar chords . but the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics . of course , many people do not like neil young 's vocals , but there are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album , including a soulful , a capella arrangement of `` america the beautiful , '' which closes the album . so basically , i feel the vocal performances compensate -- though not totally -- for the lack of musical diversity . lyrically , the album is pretty blatant ; it could almost be a 60 's protest album . but underlying that , is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better . there are a few decent tracks on the album , even if they are not exactly mind-blowing ( not that neil young was ever a showboater ) . `` after the garden '' is actually quite a good song as is `` shock and awe . '' `` flags of freedom '' is a bit of an upper , so i can probably call that the album highlight , though i 'm sure the more politically-minded citizen will enjoy `` let 's impeach the president , '' an almost humorous overview of bush 's faltering standpoints . the final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest , and offer feelings of hope and introspection . if you are not a fan of neil young , you 'll find nothing here that will convert you , so you may just want to leave this on the shelf . if you are `` anti-bush '' you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect , but that 's probably the only thrill you will get . i tend to avoid anything political , so music aside , this album 's message does not really appeal to me . it 's like , yeah , people hate the president , blah blah blah , we know ... give it a rest . for fans of neil , i would n't exactly say `` you 're not missing anything '' by avoiding this album ; there is some good stuff on there , but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the `` used '' bin at your local cd shop . and for those interested , this is not a crazy horse album .
1	marias and srayle , if you like the guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the winston , personally , i think the winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist ' on guaraldi 's works . the piano is brillaint sounding and at volume , thru a good system sounds like there 's a piano in the room . it should be emphatically understood , you are buying winston in this case , and not guaraldi . i have both versions
1	i 'm just starting to become a true fan of pigpen . earlier , i just did n't get him and i would constantly skip forward to more of the gd extended jams . lately , i 've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows . i 'm glad i picked up this set . it 's pigpen 's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory . pick it up . note : the rest of the band has some fine moments too ! !
1	john michael mongomery is back with a big bang . this album is one of the best to come out this year . it 's better than that of travis tritt , alan jackson , and kenny chesney . the song i wan na be there is one of the most touching songs since alan 's where were you . he mixes the soulful ballads , with his country rockers , and sweet love songs . this is vinatage jmm and should be bought by any true country music fan
0	can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music ? ive listened to many bob dylan albums , and every one is a gem . freewheelin ' is my favorite , but so what ? it does n't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan 's worst record was , and its saved . im not one to question this man 's beliefs or anything like that , bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe , but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is ? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
0	i 'm a huge fan of christopher lawrence 's stuff , but i aboslutely refuse to buy this cd because of the copy protection . i do not pirate music , and should be allowed to copy music i purchase onto my mp3 player of choice . this is just sad
0	ok , first off , this is the first corrs release i 've listenend to . i 'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done . i 've listened to the cd 10 times or so , on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock . it sounds good . a little too good . i agree that it 's overproduced , does n't sound even remotely spontaneous . the studio work is well done , but overdone . i 'd like to hear something else to see what they really sound like . the content of the songs is what bothers me . aside from being sappy , sentimental drivvel ( this is pop music , after all - i was n't expecting anything else ) , everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack . mmm-hmm . track 1 - i see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at curves ( tm ) , then hopping in the ford expedition ( tm ) , and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a sunnyd ( tm ) in each hand . track 2 - helicopter pans out as mid-20 's girl drives curvy mountain road in vw cabrio ( tm ) ( r ) with top down , thinking about handsome lover ... `` lmn '' ( r ) watermark in lower-right corner of screen ... track 3 - sad animals . images of puppys in cages . track 4 - actually , i like this one . mellow , laid back . track 5 - ugh . track 6 - this one is the most clever ! i see the band members - 3 girls , 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room , while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money , push it towards them and say , `` as you 're aware , the radio has lost it 's credibility . the kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there , beside what we pump across the airwaves at them . we need to entice them back . if you want a single , and this pile of cash says you do , then you 'll do what you can to save this dying medium . hell , you work in the word `` radio '' and we 'll double what we 're giving you . '' come on , the song even sounds like a psa for the international radio marketing council ... track 7 - sounds like a pepsi commercial . track 8 - ugh . wait , was n't this track 5 ? track 9 - sappy , but ok . sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics . thumbs up . track 10 - not remotely original , but alright . track 11 - interesting sound . good beat . correct me if i 'm worng , but was that a semi-pagan reference there ? that would be a bold move , for which i 'd applaud them , if in fact it is . not that i 'm pagan or anything , but hey , its a religiously positive , non-christian reference that does n't involve marilyn manson , and that takes guts . especially for radio-loving girls bands . track 12 - laid back . almost has a jazzy , lounge feel . track 13 - produced by former ace of base member ? bubbly , upbeat , not too bad . track 14 - written and produced by avril lavigne ... track 15 - wow ! a relatively celtic-sounding song from a relatively celtic band ! ! and instrumental , too - big thumbs up ! in fact , maybe that 's the key . whatever . long-winded , i know , but fair . this album did n't turn me off to the corrs completely , but i do n't have very high hopes now . flame away , kiddies .
0	listening to the standards being sung by rod stewart is like listening to classical music being played on a kazoo ! if you 're new to this music , try out some sinatra cd 's . he 's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the standards
1	an outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across mexico . this set examines both traditional and contemporary music , including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular `` rock en espanol '' band , cafe tacuba . rancheras , corridos , boleros , indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented , and even a few sones from veracruz -- one of my favorite musical genres ! if you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation , then check this collection out ... it might open more than a few new musical doors
1	i inhaled this cd . after all the hype and hyper blowin ' up about this dance/punk/rock genius , i finally broke down and bought it . not that i was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80 's ( i was still in elementary school , then middle school ) , but i remember ( and still love ) the groups that influenced this disc ... the buzzcocks , heaven 17 , pil , blondie ... hell even the rolling stones `` some girls '' album . and yes , i have to say ( after finding `` death disco-songs under the dance floor 1978-1984 '' cd and i 'm ordering it ) the old stuff is more fun . but for the hipsters who do n't know this is not original genre , it 's pretty great . no , it 's very great . the first song `` daft punk is playing at my house '' was fun , and both discs made it worth driving through snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks
0	this album is not what i call a album first 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats . best track on here is `` i practice looking hard '' probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career i love that song but otha than that `` captain save a hoe '' and `` mail man '' are a discrace . he shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track
1	this is a compilation , but the original incense and peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time . i will date myself now , but i remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it . it was the first lp i had ever bought . i actually wore out the groves on the lp and came across another a few years ago . to this day , almost 40 years after i first heard the strawberry alarm clock , i still like incense and peppermints as well as their other songs . their style ranges from acid rock to jazz . the musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era . their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today 's music is . sac was in an era where 60 's music was in transition from the early beatles and old time r sound to a more acid rock sound . lyrics like 'tune in , turn on , turn your eyes around.. look at yourself ' were typical of sac 's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times . it was an odd time . on one side , we had woodstock , mini-skirts , muscle cars and fun fun fun , but , on the dark side , there were civil rights problems and the viet nam war . this transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music . although not as popular as names like the doors , jefferson airplane and steppenwolf , the strawberry alarm clock still had a huge following . my only regret is that i did n't get a chance to see them ( or the doors ! ) when they came to the city where i lived during the late 60 's . this album is a nice compilation of sac 's hits . the songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago .
1	i have been following gospel since the early 80s . i am a big fan of contemporary gospel and shei atkins defines how r gospel should sound . trinitee 5:7 along with dawkins dawkins have done a great job so far , but shei atkins covers it all -- relationships ( cheating , divorce , pre-marital sex ) ; worship ; hymns ; enocuragement ; you name it and she has a song for it . i just bought the cd and i ca n't take it out of my cd player ! ! her voice is so annointed and unique ! she can easily give beyonce , erykah badu and mary blige a run for their money ! she can easily be played on mainstream radio and everyone would be bobbin ' their heads to it -- yet she has no problem mentioning jesus in any of her songs ! for those christians who are looking for something that they can groove and relax too ( with some anointing ) please buy this cd -- i promise you that you wo n't be disappointed ! i can literally listen to every song on this cd over and over again
0	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson ? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience . hippies and white liberals love it , but where does that leave those that are living it ? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas , south of the border , and east la 's lysa flores , north of the border
1	but not the only one you should get . make this a purchase , but get live/dead also because it has all different songs , and then look at other live releases . the dead have a lot of good recordings , just pick and choose among them . this one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection . it is amazing how many good songs they have , and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff , but you ca n't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it is n't up to scratch
1	tame 's music is all about the beat . it 's what got me right from the start , a grinding , repetitious backbone to every song . tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery . tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda , periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing . its an amazing album well worth purchasing .
0	this is by far the worst kmfdm release ... no esch , no schulz , just sascha and skold messin around with a little pig.. at first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it , this album is really boring.. dirty , skurk , and preach/pervert are really the only songs worth listening to . i was embarrased to listen to `` risen '' . it was just lyrically horrible i do n't know what 's wrong with them . now in skold 's defense , he is a badass , his voice is cool and he 's a good writer his solo album is good . but we had him in symbols , adios , mdfmk , and attak it was just a bit much . this album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland . not what you think when you think kmfdm , though urban monkey warfare is still cool ... whatever i am one guy buty it , if you like awesome , if not sorry..
1	i bought a copy for a friend recently and she said `` his music sounds so fresh and it 's so singable . the lyrics are meaty , too , not just fluffy pop . i 'm kind of obsessing over this music right now -- which is fun ! thanks so much ... i 'd like to see him in concert sometime . '' i had this album for a year before i really got into it , since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate . at first listen i really liked we 'll do it all again , and put it onto my mp3 . a year later i finally got the album out again and it bleu me away . i realize that there is something slightly barry mannilowish about we 'll do it all again , because he has some lungs , not because of style or anything . he reminds me more of jellyfish , or they might be giants . some songs are so pathetic , vulnerable , and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go , but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery . anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album . the songwriting is superb and precisely produced . the second hidden track is a real gem , that you do n't need to relate to in order to appreciate . the lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness .
0	the restoration of a vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece . motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life . like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost , reconstructing motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming , and becoming as inspired as vivaldi . in listening to motezuma , one can pick up the original vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part picasso part michelangelo . as much as such painting can be taxing to the eye , portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear . except for several arias and the two sinfonias , the music has a touch and taste of the 1800 's , but not of the baroque settecento . the juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive , and just does not work . it makes at times the orchestration devoid of the vivaldi unf , charm , and texture . nonetheless , motezuma 's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as d'ira e furor armato , la figlia lo sposo , gl'otraggi della sorte , d'ove la figlia ? , s'impugni la spada , and performances by vito priante , inga kalna , and marijana mijanovic . bravo for vito priante and his interpretation of gi'otraggi della sorte , and d'ove la figlia . he does a great ornamentation in the da capos , and turns up the volume in all the right notes . just like `` terribile lo sento '' , and `` orribile lo scempio '' , `` gi'otraggi '' shares the same musicalization . somehow , this version of the score is especially more dramatic and subtlely more melodic .
1	i loved the cd , it took me back to the days of the original recordings , however the sound was not as good as the original .
0	e40 is the worst mc i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard . how on earth can someone like him get a record contract and sell records . anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are i always skip the track
0	any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as `` boulevard of broken dreams '' ( a 1934 hit song ) deserves to be ridiculed , not rewarded with a grammy . i 'm just full of original ideas . i ca n't decide whether to write a song called `` wake me up before you go-go '' or `` grandma got run over by a reindeer '' - or maybe `` do you know the way to san jose '' ?
0	after hearing `` i 'm n luv ( wit a stripper ) '' i do n't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this cd in its entirety . i 'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this cd sucks . this cd is a waste and t-pain is illiterate . there ! i said it in one sentence . holllaaa
1	jeff beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time . what you get here is an abbreviated version of him live . his song selection is not the best , but freeway jam which is one of my all time favorite beck songs is included . you also ger scatterbrain and blue wind . she 's a woman the old beatles song is also included . jeff beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off . the songs with the jan hammer group to me are very average and infact distract what beck is trying to to . unfortunately this is his only live album from his instrumental era . i truely wish he would release a dvd of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on dvd . the idea was good , the cd is too short and not up to snuff
0	this album is not very good . i am a big fan of life in general , at the show , and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks . i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip . but i did n't care , becuase it sucked . it was boring , and it had no flavor . not the mxpx i used to know
0	there is a reason why you can not listen to any tracks on amazon- you would n't buy if you could . i read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way . this band is nothing even near metallica . i have thrown the disk away- do n't bother
1	this 1989 debut album from this texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from jason mcmaster , catchy guitar riffs , and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.it fits quite nicely in my cd collection in the `` d '' column next to the dirty looks cd.i thought `` scared '' was the best song on here along with the opener , '' teasin pleasin '' and `` queen of the nile '' but i liked all of them.the best way to describe dangerous toys is that it has a heavy guns n roses sound with a poppier edge to it.it 's too bad they never made a good album after this one and dangerous toys would never get to this level again.if you want late 80 's hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup , this debut album is highly recommended.nothing fancy , just good old fashioned rock and roll
0	i never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but i love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are american country music songs . ca n't say i 'm much of a fan of american country music so was just a bit disappointed . i think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the cd . was also disappointed that danny elfman 's desperate housewives theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it . the desperate housewives theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the tv show mentioning wisteria lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds . what ligic was there in not making this a separate track ? you would then be able to memory it out on your stereo . i like listening to tv themes and i find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds . this cd is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but i guess if you 're just buying it for the theme song you 'll have to wait for some other new tv theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own . this album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show .
0	okay , i used to think that nelly was a fun guy to listen to . he made songs that i used to enjoy , such as st. louis , e.i. , country grammar , and ride wit me off of the cd `` country grammar '' . then there were a good amount of other good songs on `` nellyville '' . and the good thing about these cds was that there were not too many skip tracks . but with nellyville , nelly brought us the obnoxious hot in herre , a single that got plenty of radio playtime , but i could not stand . this was not a good sign for the future . then comes these two new cds , sweat and suit . i have not listened to most of suit , but i have listened to most of this , and it is pure garbage . this is the same nelly who made hot in herre for sure . it has a bunch of catchy songs that live off the beats and the hook to drive them to get radio playtime . most of the tracks are much worse than hot in herre , if that is believable . i just want a decent cd from nelly , i am not expecting a classic . instead he drops the definition of materialistic garbage , and i shake my head in disgust . avoid this one and get one of his older cds , or a cd from a better artist
0	i really do n't want to be mean , but i find this album very shallow . classical indian music is a very complex , subtle and beautiful thing . comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience , but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy `` world music '' cliches . i do n't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting . and this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything , i have delved deep into the avante guard , minimalism , `` new music '' , eastern and western music theory , microtonal , etc . i would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing . however if your mainstay is jungle/drum , then this would be a step up for you , so go for it , it is worth the pruchase in that case
0	i was expecting it to have a lot of international type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original . i think i may have mistaken this cd title for another of shania 's . her music is great but i do n't see a difference with the international version
0	i had reviewed the first edition of b'day and i personally called it `` business day '' because beyoncé could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed dangerously in love . actually , in my opinion if ne-yo had not inserted irreplaceable '' in this project , it could have been a bust . i agree déjà-vu and beautiful liar were hits but i give the credit to the casting rather than the script . had these songs been given to india arie , god knows what was gon na happen ! how can she accept to put out such a poor album ? some said beyoncé views releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her contractual obligations to sony columbia and team up with jay-z to form a new record label ... but this can not justify such an inconsistent and poor album . ne-yo confessed that the r genre is suffering from serious malaise . `` people just forgot what it was supposed to be , what it was supposed to feel like , the essence of what it is , '' he says forcefully . `` it 's a vibe , it 's a feeling -- it 's supposed to make you feel something , as opposed to , `let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it . ' come on man . there 's more to it than that ... '' ring the alarm from b'day falls in the same category . i read a reviewer who proclaimed b'day to be the best he 's ever had and this is like saying george bush is the best president america has ever had ... does this person know the beatles , stevie wonder or aretha franklin ? i suggest him to go back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then be able to differentiate between music and marketing . i suggest the same reviewer to get albums called what 's going on ' ( marvin gaye ) , purple rain ( prince ) , the day ( babyface ) , or even the recent let 's get lifted ( john legend ) . it is very sad to see artists ( especially hip-hop ) concentrating on making hits , shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum and most of the time i find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers . what follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records . africa is the world 's second-largest and second most-populous continent with 900 million people . maybe if the same guys had a purchasing power which exceeds latino market , beyoncé would be realising another edition in swahili which is the most widely spoken language in africa and she would be arguing she 's had a great love for african culture ever since she was a child pretending she 's coming back to the roots . anyway , let 's not be fooled by these music industry games , their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic artistic aspects . i agree bootylicious beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s.th that can reach our soul . there are some female artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash in marketing to force sales : corrine bailey rae and heather headley
0	i agree with `` music fan '' about this cd . eden is a good album , and she 's a good artist . but either this album was poorly produced or something , because this does not show her best . i would n't classify this as world music at all , because the instruments are n't used and it 's more classical pop ; if that 's a genre . it seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality . i love her , she 's unique in her genre . but she really shines as a classicist , with classics , her work by andrew lloyd webber ( who she married ) and operatic albums . this is what she 's best at , so her collaborations on eden and la luna , which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically , turned out good . i have a lot of her albums , but i would n't buy this one . it 's more something to listen to once . a few of the songs are good , the album is n't terrible , but it 's not very good
1	well it 's not quite as good as rising which is the best album ever but it 's still amazing . 1.man on the silver mountain- 10/10 this track is a classic and is still played at every dio concert and ritchie blackmore still performed it at every rainbow concert until rainbow disbanded in 1997 but anyway this may be ritchie blackmore 's strongest riff ever ! and dio 's vocal performance is excellent . anyway it 's a great fantasy song by dio and blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone . 2.self portrait- 10/10 excellent dark song by the band which fits dio 's voice perfectly another classic ! 3.black sheep of the family- 8/10 good song but not a rainbow song it 's a cover and that 's a shame because i would have loved to hear dio 's brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen 4.catch the rainbow- 10/10 another classic from this album as dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers . blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every rainbow concert until dio left the band . 5.snake charmer- 10/10 another song that takes place in the middle ages which is rainbow 's trademark . anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic . dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it 's no suprise that blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one 6.temple of the king- 10/10 here is the best ballad of all time ! ! ! ronnie 's vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too . blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album . 7.if you do n't like rock n roll- 8/10 kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an elf track . 8.sixteenth century greensleeves- 10/10 great song ! a real classic as dio puts togethor another great fantasy song . blackmore 's riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding . 9.still i 'm sad- 10/10 well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too . the live version off on stage however with dio 's vocals blow it away . i still wonder why there were n't any vocals on this . the band is ronnie james dio- vocals ritchie blackmore- guitar gary driscoll- drums mickey lee soule- keyboards , piano , mellatron craig guber- bass 2
1	the dead were primarily a live road band , but on this and the other great album from 1970 ( american beauty ) the band proved their mettle in the studio , moving into less spacey territory . the music reflects their range , from country and bluegrass to folk , blues and rock . superb . ps . their early studio effortsanthem ... , aoxomoxoa ) were also noteworthy experiments , but the music was n't as powerful as the live interpretations
0	well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work i 've decided to write my own review . i believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip , i just wan na drink beer and cause trouble types , to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks , nothing that has n't been told a thousand times over . when i first hearsd sugar ray back in 97 i thought their sound was revolutionary , i bought floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album , then the third , fourth , and fifth albums came out , the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that were n't radio friendly such as glory , personal space invader , and burning dog ; and with the release of their fourth album i bought it as well , hoping that they would get back on formula ; yes as you might of guessed i was delusional ; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted ... ..now with the release of their fifth album , they had already lost me as a fan so therefore , i give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality
0	hey folks , this is brilliant and all , like the articles say , but what they do n't mention is that it 's impossible to listen to . there are no verses , choruses , or even beats to speak of . there are no songs . it 's just a sound collage or something , from start to finish . the booklet prints lyrics but i could n't find 'em . this music is too brilliant for its own good . and you can forget about using it as party or background music . jdub 's other offerings are much better
0	the main problem i have with this cd is that it seems poorly mixed . there is no sonic depth to it - all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other
0	certainly this album offers very little to a fan of the ocean blue 's eariler work . the vocals and guitars sound quite different ( gone is that beautiful dreamy sound ) . and what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun ? just because steve lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether . so , anyway , what does this album offer instead ? harder sounding guitar , angrier sounding vocals , and songs that are somewhat intersting , but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you 've had the cd for a couple weeks . exceptions : `` whenever you 're around '' , and `` slide '' are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production
1	just lay back and listen . brian wilson never misses a note . his voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop . his composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass ( the slow middle eight section on `` would n't it be nice '' ) on this album . these songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain . recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the beach boys themselves , this is a true pop magnum opus . the best tracks are the gorgeous `` you still believe in me '' , `` do n't talk ( put your head on my shoulder '' ) , the title cut , and the tear inducing `` caroline no '' . instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity , brian wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that have n't aged a day since 1966 . the more you listen to `` pet sounds '' , the more it 's beauty envelopes you
0	it is hard to imagine what the american songbook ever did to rod stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this , not once , not twice , but three times . stewart 's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with napoleon 's decision to invade russia during the winter , it is staggeringly ill conceived . the problem , of course , is his voice . the selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer , which are countless . for starters , he has almost no range at all . next , his raspiness has no inherent beauty , and these are songs intended for beautiful voices . by their very nature , the selections are vehicles for skilled singers , their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective . stewart , because he is a rock and blues singer , never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature , expressive voice . he scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes . banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations , ( dolly parton ! ) , do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project . bear in mind that i like rod stewart ; he 's from scotland and he 's the prototypical brit blues belter . if you want to know what he 's actually good at , dig out your copy of jeff beck 's first release , truth . stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded . but that 's the problem . on truth it was the cigarettes , whisky , and swagger in his voice that made him great - it was n't about singing technique - it was about authenticity . here , the focus is on singing , and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted . albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales , nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits . to be avoided at all cost .
1	as always , opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these bach cello suites . starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this cd that this edition , the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not `` technically perfect '' , but in many ways , his most mature interpretation . you can spend hundreds trying to find a mercury copy of `` the perfect '' rendition ; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist , at the height of his humanistic understanding of music , and of life .
1	the original jack johnson lp was my favourite miles record . i also had an expensive japanese cd but all this would not prepare me for what i discover here . over these cds one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made . this is simply wonderful . ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time
0	de la proliferacion de bandas angloparlantes de los '70 , no encuentro motivos para destacar esta placa ... .una mas y nada mas ue eso..despues de todo , es mi humilde opinion ... .humm..humble pie , descansa tranquilo ... .
1	the four seasons have always been one of my favorite groups . i think frankie valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence , and the rest of the group had harmonies that only the beach boys could match . nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection . up until now , i always felt the best way to obtain all the four seasons ' best songs was by getting rhino 's single disc `` the very best of the four seasons '' . well , i was wrong . `` in season : the frankie valli and the 4 seasons anthology '' is the definitve four seasons collection . on these two discs , you find all the essential four seasons songs , including `` sherry '' , `` big girls do n't cry '' , `` walk like a man '' , `` dawn ( go away ) '' , `` rag doll '' , `` let 's hang on ( to what we 've got ) '' , `` working my way back to you '' , `` opus 17 ( do n't you worry 'bout me ) '' , `` tell it to the rain '' ( an often forgotten top 10 hit and my favorite four seasons song ever ) , `` who loves you '' and `` december 1963 ( oh , what a night ) '' . but the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities , including many songs that were either album tracks , uncharted singles or frankie vali solo singles . plus , you get it for about $ 25.00 , which i consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs . the 30+ page booklet is excellent , filled with track information ( chart positions , etc . ) , rare photos and an excellent essay written by pat sierchio . this is an absolute must have
0	if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise , this one 's for you . however , dont expect it to change your life much . the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche , `` you get what you pay for .
0	anyone ever see any of these rap `` artists '' perform live ? they 're the most boring , derivative `` entertainers '' in the world . they walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and yell their lyrics . they go from talking on records to yelling on stage . quite a stretch . all this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying `` yeah ! '' `` uh-huh ! '' `` what ! '' `` that 's right ! '' `` uh ! '' etc . get real . meanwhile , the only `` music '' provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage . it makes for the most dull , predictable `` concert '' you 'll ever see . i ca n't wait until all this nonsense just disappears . in a world of common sense , these idiots would still be flipping burgers at mcdonald 's .
0	though these are the songs that make the mills brothers famous , they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous , and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals ( certainly they are considerably older ) . these are ok , but they lack the punch and familiarity ( to a fan like myself ) of the originals . the title , though not actually misleading , leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs -- they are not . i recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills brothers records
0	the only thing you can say about today 's music is that it 's disguisting , gross , and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool , until they get shot . every copy of this cd should be burned
0	i love the who , a big part of my youth , probably in my dna , but let 's not kid ourselves : this is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers . is there any lyric here that pete has n't written before ? still writing about getting your first hit single ? ! and sadly the music sounds like face dances and all the best cowboys..etc , but not the who sell out or empty glass . the band itself sounds faceless , generic . the only redeeming features are the raspy passion in roger 's voice and pete 's right hand . i hope the complete album makes garbage of this review , but unless pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years i 'm afraid , like wire glass , it will only be a rehash of previous works , no matter how good it sounds . here 's hoping i 'm wrong
1	i felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars . i felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review , so here i am ... as a musician i could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a buckley song . their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material . so first things first i would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery . furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is 'just another tribute record cashing in on someone else 's success ' , these are musicians that know what they 're doing . what struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc ; you have the ethereal whisper of sufjan stevens , sweet folk harmonies of the magic numbers , the lazy drawl micah p. hinson . not only that , but these are great interpretations from the jeff tim cannon . very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on 'grace ' , an irish-jig inflected 'no man can find the war ' ... these artists do not desire to replace jeff or tim , they 're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music .
0	this will be the third time i have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album , and i suppose i have been too harsh , because neither of my previous efforts have been posted . lets keep this one simple . this is not music , plain and simple . i purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site , and was terribly disappointed . it basically consists of massively distorted ( and detuned ) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence , structure , or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument . call it performance art , experimental noise , whatever . it 's simply not music .
1	i do n't see how they can compare these guys to the mars volta or coheed and cambria . i can hear the prog elements but it 's more of a rush kind of prog rock , shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics . they are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band : the songs just are n't as epic as a tmv or a c & amp ; c song . i think reviewers liken brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice . this is still an amazing album that is well worth your time . go into it expecting sparta rather than the mars volta and you wo n't be disappointed
0	what they said was that katy ca n't rock just yet because she 's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme . i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night . the first problem is that her voice just is n't that strong , secondly , her lyrics never come out as if they 're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say . throughout her set , there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing ( passingly honest as well ) and that was `` snowflake . '' it 's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she 's lived in california for a long time , but she hates warm weather , sounds impossible , but she must be truthful because it 's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft . i 'm sure she has potential for the future , but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who 's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop . stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out , and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record
1	if you want some classical music to sleep to , do n't buy this cd . if you want some high energy symphonies , however , i highly recommend it . from bach to vivaldi , the pure energy of this cd will give you a new understanding of the joys of classical music . just do n't listen to track 25 , because i have no idea why john philip sousa is included with tchaichovsky
1	i 'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90 's . these days is almost impossible to find a good soul/r cd to purchase . in the 90 's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week . now , with all the rap hip hop topping the charts , what kind of music could i purchase ? luther , anita , lalah , smooth jazz maybe , some joe 's cd . and of course , this terrific cd by mr.benson . if you 're a fan of good r music and you hate the hip hop music , buy this cd now ! ! ! ! you wo n't regret !
0	i think someone forgot to tell molotov that rap-metal/rock-rap was dead . had potential , but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me
1	i have seen phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording . it is a different approach to the classic leroux novel ; one that is gentler and more romantic , but still intense and passionate . the lyrics and music are excellent . even if you are an alw/pto fan , do n't miss this production if it plays nearby .
0	this industry is `` goin down '' u call this an album ? ? ? lo
1	this album sends mixed messages to the listener . some tunes are overally happy , some quite depressing . i can only explain it in parts : radio song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking . a guest vocal from krs-one makes it quite a lively tune . puts you in the mood for a more green-style album . losing my religion - huh ? what 's this ? the album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled stipe spills problems out to the listener . the tortured riff holds out until the end , telling the listener this is n't quite like green or document ... low - the depression lingers on . low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low . my favorite on the album , i think it 's delicate and sad . my # 1 downer tune . near wild heaven - another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst . deals with the apprehension of love . endgame - a curious tune . ca n't be interpreted either happy or sad , for it is instrumental . it could go either way , it 's written in a major key , yet the melody sounds sobered , almost as if it 's a requiem . shiny happy people - takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness . a low point on the album , yet i interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks . belong - one track i do n't understand , yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album . half a world away - ah , so beautiful . essentially about enjoying life 's finer moments at the expense of moments to come . truly happy , but still holds on to the softcore angst . texarkana - the lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it 's about unfulfilled life goals . delves deeper into seeds of depression until ... country feedback - the climax of saddness on the album . this song is excruciatingly sad . the melody , the lyrics ... it kept me awake all night . one of the saddest songs i 've ever heard . me in honey - a powerful , joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out ok in the end . this album is highly recomended . r.e.m . are an incredible band .
0	first , here are some general positives about jaci velasquez : - she is a very gifted singer . her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with mariah carey and christina aguilera . - she is beautiful . and unlike a previous reviewer , i do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty . i like beautiful singing voices . i like beautiful women . there 's no difference . - she has great spiritual depth . her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love , faith and joy . now , here 's a critique of the cd : i listened to all the music samples ( as you can do as well ) and only one song caught my attention - `` lay it down '' . the other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste . but the song `` lay it down '' was different . it sounded more acoustic , more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music . i found the sound clip of `` lay it down '' to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970 's - eric carmen 's `` all by myself '' , later covered by celine dion in 1996 . `` all by myself '' is a ballad having a soft , understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus . the sample clip of `` lay it down '' appears to be in the same mold . it has a soft , understated introductory verse ; however , it seems to lack an explosive chorus . listen to the sample and hear it for yourself . the introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics : `` all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans are slowly slipping through my folded hands '' so far , so good . there 's only a piano and a violin accompanying jaci 's soft vocals . next , the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics : `` so i 'm gon na lay it down i 'm gon na learn to trust you now '' now here 's a problem . i am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of jaci velasquez to showcase her voice . but it is not forthcoming . why ? this intrigued me and i wanted to hear the whole song but i did not want to purchase a cd for only one song . luckily , i discovered that a compilation cd of jaci velasquez 's best songs was released recently and it contained `` lay it down '' . great ! i bought the cd - `` on my knees : the best of jaci velasquez '' . this is what i discovered after listening to `` lay it down '' . - the first time through the verse and the chorus , the song is definitely understated . we simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with jaci 's soft vocals . - the second time through the verse and the chorus , a drum beat is introduced and jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs . but somewhat to my dismay , this is not the same voice that i am expecting from jaci velasquez . her voice was more raspy and raw ( actually , it was sounding more like demi moore or tara reid , not that that is necessarily bad ) . furthermore , she appeared to be struggling . is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as `` on my knees '' , `` speak for me '' , and `` adore '' ? is jaci velasquez losing her voice ? i do n't know but i find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20 's is losing her voice . she is entering her prime . barring a health issue , this just does n't happen . `` lay it down '' is actually a pretty good song . in fact , i am almost of the opinion that it may be her best . i certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others . `` lay it down '' has the same message as the beatles ' classic `` let it be '' . the words are different but both songs share the same sentiment . actually , now that i think of it ... they do share a couple of words in common ... the words `` let it be '' . here are the closing lyrics : `` i 'm gon na let it be , i 'm gon na let it go i 'm gon na lay it down '' the essential lesson being conveyed is learning to `` let go and let god '' - a profound spiritual insight . something that each of us here is learning . this song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching . and though her voice is struggling through it , the song , nevertheless , works out its magic . i gave this cd 2 stars because i think jaci velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded . interestingly enough , her best sound was her first cd - un lugar celestial ( a heavenly place ) . bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound . in my opinion , the acoustic sound is more spiritual . keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects . develop a latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz . hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player . emphasize ballads . that should do the trick
0	inspiring ? no ! pleasant ? no ! entertaining ? no ! worthwhile ? no ! what are you folks sniffing out there anyway ? whatever it is , please consider passing it along , because other than the single authentic and melodic track by patsy cline ( i.e. , back in baby 's arms , which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own ) , this cd does n't have an ounce of redeeming musical , lyrical or social value in my view . nada ! zip ! even the dylan track is junk ! the entire cd is essentially drivel , put to the dull , homicide-provoking sound of endless , droning noise , with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one ( 1.0 ) ! ! ! what a waste of an a-to-d converter
0	well , ok , mehldau 's arrangements are n't bad ... he does a great version of `` paranoid android '' but otherwise ... where 's the energy ? there 's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album , and i do understand this as being a more laid back , mellowed-out album ... but it is still possible to be more exciting , energetic , or emotional in this style . all three of these things are pretty much absent from this cd which ends up making it dull . : yawn
0	after two albums of wholly instrumental music , joe satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing . `` flying in a blue dream '' is the only satriani record with several ( six ) vocal cuts . so how are they ? well , satch 's voice is n't superb , but he does an ok job . the problem really is with the material -- it 's clear he 'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features . the only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues `` big bad moon '' -- the piece is blazing and explosive , the vocal is passable , and satriani is on fire . but pieces like `` ride '' , `` the phone call '' and `` strange '' are all pretty much forgettable ( well , `` ride '' is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable ... ) . the remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory ( and primarily acoustic ) pieces ( `` the feeling '' ) which are nice but largley filler and `` surfing with the alien '' styled instrumentals ( `` one big rush '' , `` back to shalla-bal '' ) . the exception is the chugging opener and title track , `` flying in a blue dream '' , which features satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist . invariably , the album is a bit too weak for its own good -- it 's probably also a bit too long ( about 65 minutes ) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit . start with `` surfing with the alien '' , come back to this if you want more of the same
1	like many before me , this `` blue '' beatles best-of served as my first , in-depth sampling of the beatles ' output from their post-'revolver ' era from early-1967 onward ... you could n't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'the beatles 1967-1970 ' . i bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 ( i was 18 at the time ) on cassette , and it changed my life . true ; the 2-cd version often retails at $ 34.00 , which is a bit much , but the material contained is beyond priceless.. about the songs . the songs ! ! there 's not a lame one among the batch of 28 . what 's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone 's favorite best-of albums ... the flow of all 28 is remarkable ... a fantastic mix of all their late '60 's # 1 hits as well as choice album cuts ( `` a day in the life '' , '' i am the walrus '' ) ... seriously folks ; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover the beatles ' later output should get this `` blue '' best-of first , then graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. that 's what happened to me and i wound up ( so far ) buying all of the albums from 'rubber soul ' ( 1965 ) onwards ... this blue '1967-1970 ' never disappoints . because the liner notes/inlay booklet does n't tell you which album each track is culled from , i 'll happily fill you in : disc one : 1 . ) strawberry fields forever ( john in vocals ) 2 . ) penny lane ( paul on vocals ) ( both originally released as a stand-alone single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded for what would be 1967 's `` sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band '' . however , the two songs were n't released on any beatles ' album until late-1967 's 'sgt . pepper ' follow-up 'magical mystery tour ' . ) 3. ) sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band ( paul on vocals ) 4 . ) with a little help from my friends ( ringo on vocals ) 5 . ) lucy in the sky with diamonds ( john on vocals ) 6 . ) a day in the life ( john and paul on vocals ) 3-6 from the legendary 'sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band ' ; 1967 . 7 . ) all you need is love ( john on vocals ) 8 . ) i am the walrus ( john on vocals ) 9 . ) hello , goodbye ( paul on vocals ) 10 . ) the fool on the hill ( paul on vocals ) 11 . ) magical mystery tour ( john on vocals ) 7-11 from 'magical mystery tour ' ; 1967 12 . ) lady madonna ( paul on vocals ) 13 . ) hey jude ( paul on vocals ) 14 . ) revolution ( john on vocals ) 12-14 all stand-alone singles released in 1968 . all were/are huge hits . sweet ! disc two : 1 . ) back in the u.s.s.r.

1	before i review this classic rolling stones album , i just want to point out that juke box hero and whirligig are one in the same person . a troll who likes to trash great music and praise dire straits ( who are a good band but nit the greatest ) and green day . i say cut the shenanigans ! now that is off my chest , back to the review ! the rolling stones ' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called rolling stones records , which was distributed by atlantic at the time ( now virgin/capitol ) , entitled exile on main street was released in may of 1972 . the album was the band 's only double studio album but is one of rock 's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like the wall , quadrophenia , the lamb lies down on broadway and tommy among others . before guitarist keith richards ' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s , he was what the late producer jimmy miller called a workhorse . the album was recorded at keith 's home in france and at olympic studios in london and muscle shoals in alabama and in los angeles . keith 's music and frontman mick jagger 's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on exile on main street . songs like the opening rocker rocks off , the 50s sounding rocker rip this joint , the album 's hit tumbling dice , the country-ish sweet virginia , keith 's classic rocker happy ( and it is his most famous track which he sang ) , the slow-ish soul survivor , the fast-paced blues rocker all down the line and the soul sounding shine a light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday . ventilator blues was another highlight as it was the only song that mick and keith wrote was co-written by guitarist mick taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74 ( his solos just rocked from 1969-74 ) . exile on main street was the rolling stones ' second consecutive # 1 album and another million seller . the tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger . almost 35 years on , this album is still a classic ! this album is hugely recommended
0	this album is the worst dcfc album , why ... ... ... ill tell you why its boring , its repetitive , its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous . i mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep , especially the last track . oh my god ! ! ! that song is sooooo boring , its called stability and it will put you to sleep . i am a fan of dfcf and i loved their other albums we have the facts , plans , etc ... .. but honestly this album did not click with me . i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it , but no that didnt work . sure this album has its moments , but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything . i would not buy the album , instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster ; a movie script ending and we laugh indoors . the only 2 stand out tracks
0	mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend . this kind of crap could n't even sell a can of coke these days . choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches . i hear scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer -- and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found , but scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie
0	outside of 'curious ' sung by tina cousins , this album is a dud -- at least by 'believe ' standards . most songs sound similar with the same beat . the album wo n't make your ears bleed , but the band should have quit calling itself '4 strings ' after the departure of vanessa . it is a very different band now , and should not tease 'believe ' fans into thinking another 4 strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released . i would buy 'curious ' if it can be purchased separately , but would skip buying this album . if a future reviewer knows where vanessa ended up , please let me know . the mixers of the group are talented , but vanessa was the real star
1	mountain music offers what alabama is famous for , great music and great harmony all packaged together . the title cut is great , that harmonica and `` old man of the mountain '' intro is unique . as for `` close enough to perfect '' if any man sings that song to his lady , she is his forever . the cuteness of `` never be one '' also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it . there is n't a bad song on the whole cd and will make a good addition to any collection
1	the sounds were very convincing , i actually felt like i was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since i have a subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity ( all this was at night ) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect . it does relax you and allows you to destress . there are other types of stress management cd 's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you . johnny lina
1	this cd was well worth the wait ! it contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years . i took one of the cds out of the box , put it in the player , and within minutes my wife and i were dancing . the sound quality , in my judgment is solid , the packaging is fun and creative , and the booklet containing the cameo parkway `` story '' was an interesting read . there will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included , but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era . what great fun to hear the orlons , chubby checker , the tymes , the dovells , bobby rydell , and dee dee sharp once again .
1	i first heard joe playing in that urgent style of his , on horace silvers ' `` song for my father '' album . the thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed , like he was born to play . on this cd , felicidade in particuliar , he simmers , builds to a rolling boil , and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to brasil . also the straight ahead playing on triste ' is nothing short of marvelous playing by the group ! the whole is cd is great . go 'head joe
1	to start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd 's that cover many years of there carrer . this release is very good and worth buying . it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with branford marsalis on the sax alone . all and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd 's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd . but i would also get something from the 77 era too
1	its kind of hard to deny what krs-one has brought to the game . his flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now . standout tracks : duck down , ruff ruff ( dope match up with freddie foxx ) , 13 and good ( the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches ) , poisonous products , questions and answers , like a throttle , we in here , the real holy place ( the deepest track on here ) , who are the pimps ? and the reggae tinged joints like say gal and sex and violence are gems also . filler : none ! bottom line : bdp 's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day . besides the slammin production , krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album . any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with edutainment and work their way down to this album .
0	periodically throughout eric clapton 's solo career , his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n ' roll . his self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start , and his most recent offering , `` reptile , '' makes adult contemporary sound exciting . a similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s , with `` backless , '' `` another ticket , '' and `` money & amp ; cigarrettes '' all competing for title of clapton 's most forgetable album . the country is mellow , the blues are mellow , and even the rockers are mellow . this is easy listening for classic rock fans
0	i 'm a hardcore lynch fan and find this album a big dissapointment . i like his older season of da sicc style nott this new stuff . in one song they 're talking about louie vitton , thats not the lynch i kno
0	just be sure to read up on this closely ... it 's not the orchestra you hear in the movie , and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents enya and annie lennox , replaced by no-name voices . this is not bad music , but do n't think you 're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-cd set
1	this is part 2 of a set titled say it right . the cd has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover . also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track , non-album track , but an added dance remix plus video . if you enjoyed the first 2-track cd then this is a must . dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production . say it right [ radio edit ] has the catchy dance beats , nice vocals , excellent drums , and chorus . the lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning . apparently , it 's about not giving a lover power to control , destroy , or make you loose sleep . the melody has great rhythm , chorus , dance styles , and energetic beats . `` you do n't mean nothing at all to me '' is repeated showing a strong message that life does n't end with someone who is n't right . what i wanted brings nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion . it 's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility . it 's about going for something you wanted but never got . the outcome does n't matter because the reality is you gave it your all . as she sings about her dream and what she wanted it 's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so . the melody is soothing , pleasant in sound , and refreshing for the soul . say it right [ peter rauhofer remix part 1 ] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet . the song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects , different introduction , pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs , up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers . straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes , swirls of sounds , and much club ambiance . it 's dreamy , fantasy filled , and definitely highly paced for the dance floor . if anything is certain it is this : the remix in this cd is much better than many of her past singles . there is true dj styles incorporation more instrumentations , effects , and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans . quite sticky , infectious , and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop . club lovers do n't pass this out . nelly 's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard . say it right video [ enhanced cd ] is the video many have already seen as timbaland and nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced . this is an excellent video with much dance styles , highly energetic beats , and flairs for control and getting the message across . overall , from all of nelly 's singles i find this to be on the top of my favorite . the combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable . definitely buy this if you are a nelly fan , club hopper , or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion , different styles displayed , and the themes . it 's definitely a top sensation . before it sells out be sure to buy it . the part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you do n't want to listen to the remix . this is highly recommended for sure !
0	think twice before purchase : 1 . most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected `` all-time top 100 tv themes '' , along with the best themes from other networks . 2 . this disc has cds-100 copy protection , so you probably ca n't upload to windows media and definitely not to itunes . i could not upload from my internal cd drive , only from an external multi-format cd/dvd burner . it still only uploaded to windows media , not itunes . to get into itunes , i had to add the wma files and then convert them to mp3 . this probably caused some quality loss as i 'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format ! a time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on `` controlling '' everything . hello record execs : if nobody can add your discs to their libraries , guess what happens ? they do n't play your music ! ! ! you might think you 're protecting your valuable investment , but you 're shooting yourself in the foot instead . here 's how it goes : 1 . nobody can upload your music . 2 . nobody plays your music . 3 . nobody hears your music . 4 . nobody recommends your music . 5 . nobody buys your music . remember , this only loaded from a particular kind of drive , so it may or may not work on yours . as bela lugosi would say : bevare
0	hmm ... ok , maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd , but i heard one of the songs on it , hashkiveynu , performed ( partially ) during an episode of the west wing , and it sounded amazing ( it was not the same cantor as on this cd ) . i am not jewish and not even very spiritual , but i wanted to have that song in my collection . i immediately searched the web for the info , got the name of the chant and found this cd . i almost purchased it without listening , when i found a different site , where they actually have rather long excerpts ( 2 min . ) of most tracks , so i listened to them . boy , was i relieved and disappointed at once ! relieved that i did n't buy the cd and disappointed that i could n't get the song i wanted ( i was willing to buy a whole cd for just 1 song , that 's how much it impressed me ) . the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing , although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show . and i 'm sorry to say it but the voice also does n't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too `` operatic '' , as mentioned by many , and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me . it took all the charm and candor right out of the song ( in the show , they had a much more natural voice do the song ) . i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist . if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer ( if it can be the one from the west wing , i 'll be thrilled ) , please , let me know . in the meantime , i 'm passing on this cd..
0	get 's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd . what a mess ! never should have been made . even julie is way past the point of playing this onstage . she half talks her way through her songs , her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film . sorry julie , should have left it alone . the rest of the cast is not on a par with the film . tony roberts in place of robert preston ... not on his best day . leslie ann warren was riotuosly original in the film , rachel york trying to copy her , is not . and michael nouri ? dismal . the songs added to the score for the stage ... ... .forget it . not even worth mentioning any more . goes into the what were they thinking ? file . as for julie refusing her tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked ? c'mon julie , there was a reason for that , the show sucked !
0	i really liked this when it came ut on vinyl , but in retrospect , it was the cause , not the music . b. raitt is grand , g nash with an excellant cathedral , j c young , and the highlight to me we almost lost detroit by the great gil scott-heron . but the second disc is second rate . edit the filler and it rates higher
0	wild card is the best song on this cd . the rest just did n't do it for me and i did n't care for the latin flavor . this cd was a mess . if the rest of the songs were along the lines of wild card , i would have kept the cd . this did n't say rippingtons to me .
1	beres has done it again . this is a great cd . i can actually say that enjoyed all 19 tracks
0	buddy holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th century masters series . every one of the cds in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous . this one is no exception . look elsewhere
1	vet producer don was is aboard for this one and he pushes the ladies to write some of their most mature material , relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient . the result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on `` stunt '' . best tracks here are : lovers sparring in `` too little too late '' , twangy `` go home '' ( possibly the only time you 'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel . parental warning : this is one you 'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous f-bomb at the coda.. ) , the tale of a co-worker dalliance in `` conventioneers '' that ends with them feeling awkward about it ( `` so i wait , come in late , it 'd be great if you transferred out of state '' ) , the cheater finally caught in `` humour of the situation '' ( `` have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep ? he woke up with egg on his face , when he found that all the hens had crossed the street '' ) and the ethereal `` tonight is the night i fell asleep at the wheel '' , which utilizes an almost disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who , disembodied , surveys his own demise ( `` in all the confusion , there 's something serene , i 'm just a posthumous part of the scene '' ) . the least interesting tracks are `` off the hook '' , another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and `` baby seat '' , a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you . bottom line : while not as consistently fabulous as `` gordon '' , this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band 's talents by allowing more lead vocals from ed robertson ( `` pinch me '' , '' falling for the first time '' ) , as well as kevin 's first on the hidden track `` hidden sun '' . you also hear the ladies do things they have n't before : steven 's flute on `` tonight 's the night i fell asleep at the wheel '' , tyler 's 808 drums for `` off the hook '' , and a dash of retro courtesy of ed 's wah-wah pedal on `` conventioneers '' and kevin 's vocoder on `` humour of the situation ''
0	i bought this cd for the avril lavigne song keep holding on . i really like her song , and this is the only way i could find to buy get it . was to buy the eragon sound track . i havent seen the movie . besides that i would n't have bought it
1	all i have to say is great album
0	i got this album because obie trice did some great stuff on the 8 mile soundtrack , so i figured i 'd check out what else he 'd done . this album just does n't live up to that .
0	i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70 's , and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style , i still loved her vocal perfection . this is truly the only album i have n't played more than twice ( i did n't like it the first time , which surprised me , so i tried it again ) . it does n't showcase her voice or her talents . the songs are very ho hum . linda , put out a christmas album ( been waiting for years ) , and try to get sweetness back for this old fan
1	to set the record straight , rodney 'darkchild ' jerkins produced one song on this album , and that is 'he said ' . that said , producer waryn 'baby dubb ' campbell [ also husband of erika , younger of the duo ] did a great job on this album . not at all to say that the ladies ' singing has n't always been phenomenal . the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song , a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love ' [ their appearance on his album , speak those things ' is duly noted ] , an impressively done cover of stevie wonder 's 'you will know ' , and a cover of walter hawkins ' 'thank you ' . yes , that is the original sampled at the end of the song . every album that mary mary has released to this day [ yes , all two of them ] has proven that gospel music can be musically current -- impressive -- and still within taste . that 's what happens when you have the best on your team ... baby dubb , while being mary mary 's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard 's 'let go ' , 'sweetest thing ' , 'all i am ' , fred hammond 's albums 'speak those things ' and 'somethin ' 'bout love ' and countless other records . the downside : the last two songs . they 're of forgettable quality . while happy , forgettable . overall , this album is an essential
0	i love the song `` nasca lines '' which i first heard on a putamayo world music cd , so i ordered `` under one sky '' since it has `` nasca lines . '' i figured all the music would be as good , but i was so disappointed . it was very jazzy , which i hate . i 'm going back to the putamayo cds
1	i was introduced to nitin through my cousin who lives in england . she saw him live in london and raved about it ... so off i went in search of this artist . he was difficult to find ; nonetheless i was determined . i am one of those people who love music from almost all genres , cultures and corners of the globe . in other words , i am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener . i look for music that proposes thought ( although i do believe even top 40 has its place ) if you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion , along with a powerful subtlety check nitin sawhney out . you wo n't be disappointed .
0	i 'm an avid tony yayo fan , but this album just did n't cut it . maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure . i do n't know . but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them . hopefully his next album will be way better . a few songs are good to listen to . i would think , coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about , but `` so seductive '' being your first single ? ? come on . i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean . rating c
1	better balance of songs on this cd . this cd shows growth in a the band.they are great fun live check them out if you get the chance ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i love south music like three 6 , lil jon , master p , but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead . man jd is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he ca n't get no one wit talent . every song on here sounds like it was hurried up . fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick .
0	it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become . nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance : ashlee simpson , lindsay lohan , and now paris hilton ? lmao ! no seriously though , i 'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous . yes , i know she 's the hilton hotel heiress , but i 'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention . all she did was live off her family fortune , but now thanks to that fortune , she was able to get the right contacts , to make her own record label called `` heiress records '' which is a sub-label of warner bros. after a reality show series , modeling career , a sex tape , and a couple of roles in a few movies , what did she think to herself ? i think i want to be a singer now ? apparently . and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about . `` stars are blind '' is her first single off her debut album `` paris '' and let me tell you it 's nothing new or original . the song has kind of a ska beat , which i really do n't think much of . her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon , and the lyrics are mediocre . sorry paris , but you failed miserably as a musician . leave this profession for the people that really have the talent
0	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par testament release . testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience . this is not a horrible album , but compared to any other testament album , it is easily their worst . only the die-hard testament fan , or those into commercial metal should pick this up .
0	as a fan of pete seeger 's music , i bought this cd in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music . disappointingly , i 've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs . peggy 's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album , as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang . i may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable best-of set , but i 'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting . only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set ; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of pete 's fine albums such as the carnegie hall classic
0	well , the labels did it again . first , when they released the album `` dream '' on cd . their biggest hit from that album `` you never done it like that '' turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release . they did it again with this `` ultimate collection . '' that being said , i love some of their other hits , especially `` the way that i want to touch you . '' luckily , the rest of the tracks are the originals . if you 're looking for the original version of `` you never done it like that '' , you would have to get the 20th century masters collection of theirs
0	certainly not deserving of the grammy ( for cast recording ) . each of the other nominated productions is much better than this poor excuse of a revival .
0	bob james - the mastermind of smooth jazz . `` h '' , `` touchdown '' , `` grand piano cannyon '' . eternal pieces of art . brave and thoughtful new directions in jazz . we owe him a lot . but the recent releases of fourplay -including `` x '' - do n't meet my expectations at all : predictable , repetitive , overproduced computer-music . the typical fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another cd . larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on `` tournabout '' - but then the song falls back again to old routine . `` screenplay '' is a good one ( one of two songs that were done by bob ) . the rest , hmm ... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy . do n't get me wrong , i like all of the guys . every single member of the group has done great things in the past . so - a bit more breveness , yes please
0	save your money on this one . it 's sooooooo bland- with no jams ! what a disappointment . can i get a refund
1	this cd has so much going on and going for it - it 's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans . lee ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80 's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks . he 's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right . `` blue in green '' is one of my favorite jazz compositions by miles davis and ernie watts on tenor sax more than does it justice . `` ocean ave. '' is as breezy and beachy as i think it 's meant to be . my favorite tracks are easily `` she walks this earth '' ( ivan lins ' vocals are bossa nova beautiful ) , `` blue in green '' and predictably for me `` papa was a rolling stone '' with powerful , crystal clear , unique trumpet by chris botti and soulful , rhythmic vocals by kenya hathaway and grady harrell . i went looking for that track because i am transfixed by chris botti 's trumpet and what i found was a remarkable cd in its entirety . happy me . ;
0	jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse . seriously , think about marc bolan trying to sound like a '50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like
0	see bonnie raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs , actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `the fundametal things ' , but no
1	on one hand , this cd is a straight ahead instrumental rocker , but johnny a really shows how great he is with ballads , such as his covers of `` wichita lineman , '' and `` yes it is . '' in fact , those two ballads alone are worth the price of the cd by themselves . but johnny a can flat kick your ass , too . he 's a biker and his tunes like oh yeah , in the wind and two wheel horse are named for his other hobby . and they rock , but there 's nothing cliched or tired in his style . he always seems to be looking for new ways to say something . i saw him in person at the triple door in seattle sometime in february 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album . the guy is one amazing guitar player . he played his signature gibson hollow body , fitted with a vibrato tailpiece ( bigsby ? it was like the old chet atkins `` country gentleman '' model ) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects , coming eventually through a pair of marshall combo amps . the guy had some of the best clean tones i 've ever heard from anyone , anywhere . basically , johnny a is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument . and he 's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that 's all his own , and that 's saying something these days . if you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar , combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format , this cd is just what you 're looking for . in fact , i guarantee you 'll be knocked out . five stars .
0	this stuff is so boring . i ca n't believe people still listen to this stuff . seriously come on people ! i laugh every time i see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere . plus busta has admitted to having `` relationships '' with men if you get what i mean . makes you wonder about a lot of rappers ... .
1	though i am only 33 years old , i grew up listening to bob wills . merle haggard did a great job with this one ( as he always does ) . i got goose bumps listening to it . it took me back to my childhood when i would sit on the porch with my grandfather listening to bob wills . the only thing missing is the scratching of the needle on a nearly worn-out album
1	trace adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more ! can trace ever produce any music that sounds bad ? his low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his god ! i strongly recommend that everyone has trace 's latest cd in their collection ! a big ten-four in my cd player
1	this outstanding effort by prince consists of mostly spare jazzy r tunes , driven by incredibly loose , free-flowing live instrumentation . i could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album . with the three disc format there is a lot to absorb , and the third disc really can largely be done without , but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work . it should also be noted how especially romantic prince is on this album . this album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage , and it shows because this c.d . is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads . most of his albums only contain one or two ballads , so if you 've been longing for an album that includes more , then this album should really appeal to you . this c.d . does not fit into the `` standard '' prince `` mold '' ( i know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a `` prince mold '' but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works , even those that are admittedly not as good ) . the reason for this is that prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album . the fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new ( he covers songs by bonnie raitt and the stylistics ) which is unsual for this constant innovator , but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else . one minor problem that i notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc , prince just does n't pay much attention to the lyrics . there are too many generic r come-ons and cheesy cliche 90 's catch phrases such as `` gettin ' your groove on ' , and prince is much too clever , witty , and creative to resort to such things . but , really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs . and then , he has songs such as `` soul sanctuary '' and `` let 's have a baby '' which are two of the most well-written ballads that i 've heard from him . `` in this bed i scream '' is just magnificent both lyrically and musically . he takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way . this clever , poetic , and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor . other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of `` we gets up '' , the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on `` curious child '' , and the sincere , pure passion of the just so perfect r/gospel blend of `` savior '' . `` joint 2 joint '' is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements , with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story . the first two discs are really solid overall . the third disc however finds prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music , and the results are not very impressive . but , i do n't see how they could be , even coming from prince . techno for the most part is insanely repetitive , monotonous , and downright drone-like . there are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it ( slave , my computer , and the title track ) . well , maybe four , his cover of `` la la ( means i love you ) '' is actually really good too . those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted . the most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line `` www 'dot ' emale `dot ' com '' on `` emale '' : - ) . i was unaware of this feat for a while because i used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90 's g-funk whistle . so overall , this album really does rank amongst prince 's best work , and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more r
1	this is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical , haunting scores ever composed for a film . each succeeding track is a treat for the ears , refreshing and invigorating . neeley and varese sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem . in my opinion , though , the only part of the entire cd that does n't work is the beginning of the `` waxworks '' track - the score to this particular moment in the film ( when norma , watching herself onscreen , rises triumphantly to proclaim `` i 'll be up there again , so help me ! '' ) is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom . in the original , the music is strong , powerful and almost spine-tingling , but this moment on the cd is underwhelming and not fully realized . however , what is one misfire ( totalling all of eight bars , at most ) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording ? ! in short , if you love film music , you most likely love the score to sunset boulevard - and if you love sunset boulevard , then you will most likely love this recording , too
1	i own a lot of waylon jennings albums but i have to say , i find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10 times . if you want to buy just one waylon album this is the one to own , the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and the music is alive . simply great , i ca n't say enough good things about this cd
0	the cd came without a cd case and the cd did not play . i am very disappointed
1	not speaking or understanding tibetian , did n't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie , and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why . it guides you like a sherpa , gently leading you along the high trails , powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air . you are at once engulfed in the tibetian life , you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants , singing bowls , and drums
0	however despite what amazon reviewer kristy martin may believe , ms croft does not need to get her freak on . wow . i guess hip hop can do no wrong . in a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film , here comes another fanboy/girl of hip hop 's hopele $ $ $ ley misplaced garbage . thank you kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along . ( missy ) this song is soo done it 's practically taboo to listen too . and outkast ? puhf_ckingleez . these clowns sold out a long long time ago
1	oh ! boy ! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer dvd-audio/super-audio multichannel surround system.this was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192khz.example ..donald fagen `` morph the cat '' dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.today we have the so call bonus dvd audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.if you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated dvd-audio disc sold between $ 14.99- $ 29.99 and the so call bonus dvd disc ... you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in `` all channel stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call dvd 5.1 disc.the stereo version of the beatles love album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended
1	since sunset boulevard is one of my favorite films , i bought the london cast album long before the musical came to america . patti lapone is the ultimate broadway star , having created the role of evita . her soaring versions of `` as if we never said goodbye '' , and `` with one look '' are unmatched . her power and vocal range soar ! all of norma 's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate glen close 's lack of , ( or nonexistent ) singing ability . in fact , this dvd was unavailabe to the american market during the american run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves . perhaps alw did n't want the american audience to hear the masterwork of this production . kevin anderson , a brilliant actor , does not have the operatic quality of alan cambell in the u.s. cast , but he portrayed joe gillis with far more guts and passion . this is not for the lover 's of oklahoma of showboat , but for lovers of more contemporary musicals , this one is perfect
1	despite the excellent screenplay by sam shepherd and the solid acting by harry dean stanton , i found `` paris , texas '' a rather unimpressive film , and the only thing that kept it together for me was cooder 's astounding soundtrack . the music here is simple , yet very moving and even haunting . his guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey . it seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the southwest . every time i listen to this cd it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in nevada , se california , etc . also , it 's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story ( `` i knew these people '' ) told by stanton 's character , since to me that was the best part of the movie . even so , seeing `` paris , texas '' is not a prerequisite for enjoying this cd , the music is phenomenal in its own right
1	great music , great band . this is a must buy . recommended to all hard rock lovers
1	i love this pretenders album and chrissie always rocks but i love the songwriting skill of billy steinberg tom kelley . they wrote `` love colours '' , `` night in my veins '' and the hit `` stand by you '' . her follow-up to this , `` viva ! el amor ! '' also contains three tracks written by them . i purchased this long after its release and was glad i did . steinberg kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes . something not all big names can do on their own and chrissie wisely is aware of this .
0	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong . i click on one song and get another from on the list . what gives anyway

0	after reading her excellent halloween book , i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning . i always search for `` different '' halloween cds , but this was filled with the same old stuff . chains , moans , and spooky laughs ... then more chains , moans and spooky laughs . very dissapointing
1	the animals , a group that included eric burdon and alan price , were the first major pop stars to emerge from newcastle , a city located about 300 miles north of london , therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching . it is fortunate for us all that the animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best r+b music to come of the uk in the sixties . their biggest hit was house of the rising sun , a re-working of a folk song ( apparently inspired by josh white 's version of the song ) that gave them a transatlantic number one hit . they had five other top ten uk hits with mickie most , these being i 'm crying , do n't let me be misunderstood ( a cover of a nina simone song ) , bring it on home to me ( a sam cooke cover ) , we got ta get out of this place ( the version included here is the uk version - a markedly different recording was released in america but was unavailable for inclusion in this set ) and it 's my life . apart from their singles , the animals recorded many other covers including boom boom , dimples , i 'm mad again ( all john lee hooker ) , around and around , memphis tennessee , how you 've changed ( all chuck berry ) , i 'm in love again , i 've been around ( both fats domino ) , talking about you , hallelujah i love her so and i believe to my soul ( all ray charles ) . these covers clearly demonstrate what their main influences were , but they also wrote some of their own songs . all the music i 've mentioned so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation . nevertheless , despite the title of the compilation , it is n't actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made with mickie most as producer , although the liner notes describe their whole career . after the split , they switched to another record label , where they had some success using the name eric burdon and the animals , including two more uk top ten hits ( do n't bring me down , san franciscan nights ) and several lesser hits , all of which can be found elsewhere ( search for eric burdon ) . alan price left the group before the split with mickie most and had several hits as a solo singer . these are also outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find . this complete collection ( apart from the american version of we 've got to get out of this place ) of the first and most important part of the animals ' career may be more than some people want - there are single cd collections available if you just want the hits - but if , like me , you like to explore beyond the hits , this is for you
1	... heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years , elastica 's justine frishmann . 13 is a dark record , produced by william orbit . nearly every song is injected with despair , sorrow , bitterness , and an achy , heart-breaking sadness . these moods are encompassed on such tracks as tender , 1992 , battle , and the tear-jerking no distance left to run . also included are the trip-hop masterpiece trimm trabb , the humourous trailerpark and b.l.u.r.e.m.i. , and coxon and albarn 's co-written pop-masterpiece , coffee and tv
1	we are using this series of cds in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic ! we especially love this one about bach - what an awesome man ! the story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children 's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration . it is done very well ! my children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this cd and so are my husband and i

0	what a load of junk . gu 29 cd1 was ok. everything else these two have done separately is pretty useless . make sure you hear a sample before buying this . do n't say you were n't warned .
1	this arrived the other day , i pre ordered it . two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion . its about time this was available on cd and here it is . sounds great ! go get it for the collection
0	generally harmless , except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents . the song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated , cynical adults . but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old . i would n't bring this cd into your house

0	this cd its just horrible , they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! there are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out
0	there 's a review here that compares hank iii with hank , and then suggests that hank iii adds to the legend with his clever lyrics . i think that person has never listened to hank 's stuff . it 's hard to compete with , `` you wore out a brand new trunk , packin ' and unpackin ' all of your junk . '' that 's my favorite hank lyric , and there are many , many more -- very , very clever , very hard to compete with . that said , i love iii . he has a hard way to go , and apparently he 's going it . i ca n't even imagine the dichotomy he faces -- looking and sounding like hank , and i 'm sure he loves that , yet wanting to do his own stuff . i bought his first cd as soon as i knew about it , and i 've been waiting for this one . on the first one i was disappointed with his writing ( but he 's a kid , for pete 's sake ) and was knocked out by wayne hancock . on the other hand -- i did n't know iii existed until i saw him on conan o'brian , and he was one of those performers who makes your head whip around and hit the `` record '' button so you can find out who he is . i 've listened to everything on lovesick broke driftin ' and i love it . except for atlantic city -- once you 've heard the band do that , you do n't need anything else . hank iii , however , is on his way , and i 'm rooting for him . he 's got the stuff . ( and , by the way , to echo the sentiments of others on this board , i do n't listen to country anymore , at all ! it 's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares ! ) i have n't listened to a country station for more than 10 years . go , iii .
1	this album iz off da freakin chain ! ! ! ! ! great music and grace slick iz the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	julieta venegas did it again . she scored an album that is not alternative in style , however it is very catchy pop music . her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on . you can sing along and express day to day feelings . julieta continues to use instruments i like such as the harmonica . and of course , julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances . my personal favorite is `` me voy '' , a very positive song about a not so positive event , breaking-up . keep up the good work , julieta . your songs are appreciated .
0	of every band/group , there is always the weak link , tony yayo proves that he is the one with thoughts of a predicate felon . many of the songs are not produced by dr. dre ( one of the few things that g-unit has going for them ) resulting in `` greasy '' and bad beats . tony yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing , being locked up in prison , hoes , ect . he lyrics are n't all that great either , making him have the worst voice in g-unit as well . he sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up . the few pluses on the album are `` drama setter '' feat . eminem and obie trice followed by eminem 's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats ( even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake ) as well as `` g-s**t '' . my advice , download these two songs- this cd is n't worth $ 14.00
1	if you are looking for true hip-hop , this is a must for your collection . four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd . quit buying those fake ass hip-pop albums and get the real deal . from the production to mcing its all there . matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks .
0	i really think snoop is a good rapper . he should only have stopped 10 years ago . i 'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff , and i do n't like none of the beats here . and what 's left then ? nothing . i found out after i bought this album : i 'm not a snoop fan anymore ... old school is the bes
1	kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth . the dreaming was underrated when it was first released , but i think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time . this is a superb album , tracks like sat in your lap , suspended in gaffa , leave it open , night of the swallow , houdini , and get out of my house proving this point . there 's lots of anger on this album , as kate put it herself many years ago , and it is her `` darkest '' effort to date , but it 's pure brilliance ! buy it and be convinced ... ..
1	this is some great music from a litte know movie . you wo n't be let down
0	first of all floetic was a brilliant album and after i heard superstar on the radio i thought flo'ology was going to be a classic too . i was wrong . this album lacks originality , its inferior to be precise . the first time i popped this cd into the system , i found myself being friends with the skip forward button . the length of the records is despicable this cd is not worth having ... .the only track that stands out for me is superstar and i think common is amazing
1	while not every song my be my favorite , they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days ! all the monster cds i have bought have been real gems .
1	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics . he has an eclectic mix of love songs , `` we are the world '' type songs and a few others on this album . he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes . i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me . lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album - i sure do
0	mcmurtrys new album really disappoints . i am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with james past work ( as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical ) . while mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza ( see the elephant ) or that provide an echo to the way we americans spend our time ( holiday ) , his attempts on childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing . in past attempts mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of americana , yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside . the thoughtfulness evaporated on this work . like many aging musicians , mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse . the cliche and empty `` we cant make it here '' is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility . mcmurtry , previously able to frame an issue , seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills . criticism is not intelligence , and we can only hope that mcmurtry can get on track going forward . perhaps he should shun the `` pc crowd '' and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial american scene for his next album
0	some will mistake me for a evidence hater , but i 'm really not . i just want the man to put some effort into what he does . i 'm tired of taking just any ol ' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the `` fans '' do n't expect very much -- or simply do n't know what good is anymore . sure , you can relate to what evidence is saying , but you can put on a dope instrumental cd , sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head , have a discussion about any topic , and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album . i quickly get tired of the `` slow flow '' -- see : talking -- and i feel like anyone can do it . i do n't shell out money for things i can do myself . really , the only difference between him and 50 cent is content . when i hear someone say `` slow flow '' my mind translates that into `` reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on '' because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came . and lot of these beats , though very dope , are as slow as his flow is . couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like joe scudda ( i 'm sorry , i tried to like him , but dude is simply terrible ) , big pooh ( same goes for him ) , and madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener . the only dope guest shots come from phonte , planet asia , and slug . yeah , i know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names , but i 'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real . when ev actually puts his back into it , he creates some dope material . `` down with new york city '' is nice piece of work that has ev gettin ' busy over an air tight jake one track . `` chase the clouds away '' is another track where ev does his thing over a pounding alc production . the standout to me had to be `` line of scrimmage '' which features ev and atmosphere frontman , slug , getting nice over another dope alc creation . with the likes of alchemist , sid roams , jake one , dj khalil , babu , and evidence himself providing dope beats , i 'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the lp . simply put , i do n't recommend playing this cd while operating heavy machinery . i respect ev and his whole crew ( hell , i love rakaa ) , but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat . i can only call it the way i see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not . bring on the unhelpful votes if you want , but i can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up . everyone else should download this and test it out first . standout tracks : letyourselfgo feat . alchemist phonte , a moment in time feat . planet asia , line of scrimmage feat . slug ( my favorite ) , and down in new york cit

1	the first time ever i saw this group `` amici forever '' as they were singing `` unchained melody '' , i have confused that song like classical music . because , it was very familiar . actually , i did n't know exactly what 's that song that moment . finally , i knew that song is popular music i used to sing . so , laughed myself . it was brilliant and great performance i ever heared before . i bought dvd , too . and i recommended my friend and he also felt their singing like me . he said great and thanks to me
1	you can resume eddie cochran very well with one cd.after all , when he died he was only 21 years old.this selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the legendary master series released in 1990.his best songs are there : summertime blues was of course a favorite of the who , who often featured it in their concerts.i am particularly fond of jeannie , jeannie , jeannie , c'mon everybody and the marvellous somethin'else with it 's great shuffle , a trademark of eddie.if you are interested in rock 's early days , you 'll enjoy this cd
1	maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986 . not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers , but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past . iron maiden to powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic . the cd starts out with caught somewhere in time , a galloping bassline , and parallel guitar make it , not only a classic , but ahead of its time . the rest of the cd id in pure form . my favorite track , however , is alexander the great . the intro starts out with a whisper of that era , and slowly builds to the howl of , i feel , the battle cry of the great warrior of history . iron maiden did not dissapoint with this cd . it is very well mixed and produced , and remains a standard in my collection of cd 's .
1	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits . i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album , back when i was playing in country bands . much of this material is kinda introspective , but hey , on the plus side you get great vocals , well crafted songs , tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't . and these days , that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan
1	this was not a waste of brad 's time or mine . good job !
0	for those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the thief soundtrack ( like myself ) congratulations - you have the version of the cd that contains the best song on the soundtrack , beach scene . it has been dropped for this us release . for those who were interested in obtaining the thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song , beach scene ( most of the other songs can be found on other tangerine dream albums ) , please realise the following differences between beach theme and the now dropped , beach scene . the song , beach theme is a much shorter track ( almost by half ) and there is a very cheesy , acoustic , `` rock n ' roll '' , drum beat that was mixed/dubbed over the original beach scene song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic , sequenced drum beat in it . it 's beach scene that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981 . if that is the song you remember ( fell in love with ) and are looking for , do not buy this latest release . keep looking for those out of print cds - they are out there . on a lighter `` note '' , it 's very nice to see they added the ending/end-credits song , confrontation . this is a lose/win scenario for thief soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you . if you already have the earlier releases with beach scene on it then buying this latest version will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack
1	a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp . he also recommended getting his road to hell cd . both of these cd 's were money well spent . i 'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80 's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity , mainly due to his top 20 hit `` fool ( if you think it 's over ) '' . for some reason i never equated that song with this artist . the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity . he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like `` fool '' or `` let 's dance '' and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like `` road to hell '' . no matter what the genre of music , this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove . there 's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd . `` auberge '' and especially the wonderful `` on the beach '' stuck out for me . but you get many styles here . and each song sets a different mood . from the easy listening `` winter song '' or the catchy `` looking for summer '' . or some excellent blues rock like `` road to hell '' , `` god 's great banana skin '' or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea 's tasty slide guitar skills . i do n't know how i missed this artist after all of these years . but i 'm a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album . whatever style that it might be , i 'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of . this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist . if your like me , after hearing this cd you 'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums . i 've since picked up his late 80 's album `` dancing with strangers '' . another very nice cd . most of the music on this best of cd is almost 20 years old , but it feels like it could have been written today . in other words it 's well composed music that holds up very well over time . and i 'm sure if your like me and not familiar with rea 's music , the minute you hear `` fool '' or `` on the beach '' it 's going to bring the good part of the 80 's back to you . greatest hits cd 's should all be this good . highly recommended
0	do not buy this cd , the first two reviews said this is a good cd . nope . i 'll tell ya the real about this cd . i believe this was 305 's first cd , and i do n't see how this cd was ever in mass production . while it does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist . 305 got much of the material for this cd on techmaster p.e.b 's masterpiece bass computer . any one who has both cd 's can tell . if your looking for bass , you 'll find it here . but you can find knock with any bass artist . i give this cd one star for biting techmaster
1	i hesitated for so long to get this . having followed moby 's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years . i like his early techno/rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns . but i wondered : has moby gone soft ? has he sold out ? i was pleasantly surprised . look at the cover and add rain . that 's the overall mood of this album . i find rain to be cleansing on many levels , often building a mood of pensiveness , reflection and a fragile peacefulness . there is a glorious melancholy in the music , the lyrics and the singing on the album . take the chilled out moments from moby 's other albums and build on it . that 's what he 's done here . almost every song has singing - primarily moby 's longing , almost cyring , voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights , when the world does n't make sense , when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart , yet with a subtle hope underneath it all . it 's downtempo , mellow , moody and sometimes sad . but it is beautiful . do n't expect `` old '' moby , do n't look for the commercial jingles of play . just put it on and listen

0	it is bad ! as much as i like `` 10 new songs '' , this one disappointed me a lot .
1	a great sampling of one of top 10 musicians from the 20th century
0	this album bores me out of my mind . only two decent tracks : bad boys and bonnie and clyde . and i 'm no avid radio listener . bet and mtv actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks . so i guess they good for somethin
1	every listen i get more into this cd . many catchy songs . i now need to buy more of donald 's solo stuff . great music
0	sucks . if you like this album you are a poser . that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal . one guy i know that listens to norma jean , as i lay dying , and unearth , called me emo for listening to acid bath . how stupid can you be ? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal , such as morbid angel , darkthrone , amon amarth , old sepultura , and dissection
1	i prefer the live versions of these pieces . its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up . i was at the concert for live record and think that they ( the pieces that are on this cd ) really come alive when being performed live
0	i like the music , but the sound quality is terrible . i bought this cd because it was released in 2003 , but there is zero improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks
0	i purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend ... ..a few hours later in ended up in the bin ... ..very dissapointing , bland and not to mention boring and derivative ( some people from new york would understand what i mean ) . in summary ... .not only does kylie mingogue ( i wont grace her name with capitals ) fall flat on cd ... .she also can not perform live and rely 's on `` gay camp it up '' imagery to hide behind ( a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit ) . a very bad performer and a shameful album .
1	unlike other classical-crossover artists minus emma shapplin , i believe sarah brightman works for art , not for money , or fame , or show off . like what she said in an interview , she sees music a a whole -- music is to be enjoyed ( and categorization should never get in the way ) . that 's apparent from this very endearing album la luna . i think this album is as a whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still the mystical figlio perduto , the dreamy serenade/how fair this place , the gloomy gloomy sunday , and the sweet la luna . i read what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing better than sarah on la luna/song to the moon . i think that 's not true , at all . just because the singing is n't wagnerish , it does n't mean it 's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he said . i think it 's easier to just sing full out operatic like , say , renee fleming than singing with so much passion and being lilting without losing any of the voice 's qualities ( laid back with 'that ' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at the end ) . and , duh , she sings classical properly , ffs . and tell me a name of a soprano who could sing how fair this place with such grace , without sounding like a screeching steel can . i 've also listened to many other versions of gloomy sunday . billie 's is weird . sarah mclachlan 's is out of context . sinead o ' connors ' is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine . only sarah brightman 's and bjork 's versions are best for my ears . i have introduced her music ( from phantom of the opera to dive to timeless to harem ) to many people , and apparently they enjoy them very much ! there is this radio that 's a favourite of us where gloomy sunday and time to say goodbye are played as much as bon jovi 's it 's my live and sophie ellis bextor 's take me home and offspring 's pretty fly . they 're good music and enjoyable . albeit i also like many other sopranos . i like lucia popp 's interpretation of richard strauss ' lieders , christa ludwig 's of schubert 's , natalie dessay , kiri te kanawa , etc . :
0	i ca n't , for the life of me , understand the appeal , or better , the necessity for the black crowes . to call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they do n't possess ... there 's nothing here that has n't been done better , with more creativity and feeling , and of course , originality , by the stones , faces , et al ... and it 's not a valid counter-argument that the stones stole from the great blues masters , because , of course , they did ... but what they also did is add some value , something of their own , that was completely fresh ... what these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on..
0	... unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc . i f***ing hate them . they are overplayed so much on the radio , and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life . do n't waste your money on this cd , just turn on the radio ... then turn it off
0	im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately ( think tony gayo ) . there are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore . all prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he 's just there to be there . amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them . did we really have to hear this one to see that ? if you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving
1	i caught sonny in a live performance this past november , so i got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album ... sonny please . he opened the set with a fiery `` sonny please '' which smoked for a good 15 minutes ( i believe that victor lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving ) . for a man approaching 77 years of age , i was impressed with not only sonny 's playing and gracious presence , but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets ... trust me , the man can still play ! this album may not be another `` saxophone colossus '' or `` the bridge '' , but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of sonny 's fans . if you have no recorded music by this jazz legend , this cd is a respectable starting point
0	first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage . besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire , he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point , that was of course before 50 's influence which brings us to our problem . the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album . i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south . if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks , verses etc . everything may have been fine . the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the `` a '' is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable . this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50 's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south 's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise 's up . this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he 's dropped but , im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what 's in your heart and get back to business .
1	this album sparked the so-called `` neo-soul '' movement years before it was adopted by other artists . back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and prince broke the music back down to its roots . this concept was later used by tone tony toni , brand new heavies , and d'angelo .
1	like it says in the ( `` 33 1/3 '' ) liner notes : `` ... world class chops and originality '' . if jazz is your bag and guitar licks get your attention , these tracks will set off fireworks ! my music collection started circa 1960 , but these guys made it to the top of my list in a heartbeat ! if i could , i 'd give it 10 stars
1	i was waiting for this cd for a very long time , i mean i love all greg 's album , they are intense , passionate , but amber headlights is giving me back the soul of the afghan whigs , somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . i love his voice , the way he sing , the way he loves his music . you can t explain the beauty of this cd , there are great rock-blues-love songs : the first time i heard `` so thight '' it makes me jump up and down my room ( i haven t done it for long time since black love `` going to town '' ) , then cigarettes ( what a great song , this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with `` gentleman '' in my hand ) , then `` domani '' that in italian means tomorrow , kind of greg 's jazz slow song in which his voice is so low that you can t even try to sing like that.then song after song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years . if you don t know anything about afghan whigs and greg dulli then it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist of our time .
0	i bought this album because i loved the title song . it 's such a great song , how bad can the rest of the album be , right ? well , the rest of the songs are just filler and are n't worth the money i paid for this . it 's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe . kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene . he 's got ta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town . i 'll get down off my soapbox now . but country music really needs to get back to it 's roots and stop this pop nonsense . what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things .
0	i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie . i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good . i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words . although the music is nice , i know she would not be too impressed . we had seen the movie together and we loved mr. ray 's song and wanted to know the words . it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it
1	i had been hearing `` always thinking of you . '' but , i never got who it was . i purchased xm radio and on the smooth jazz channel , i heard the cut again and got the artist name . purchased the cd based on that one cut . every cut is great on this cd . i look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future . he has his own style . but , not only do you hear hints of benson and brown ... ... ... .i hear a little doc powell as well . i will be introducing friends to this great artist ... ... ... ... keep it coming ... ... ... ...
1	i heard the first beat lp ( `` i just ca n't stop it '' ) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band 's brand of ska/soul/rock . for some strange reason , i never bought `` wha'ppen '' and never got familiar with it . i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away . of course , i did buy `` special beat service '' and found it to be par excellent . so i ordered `` wha'ppen '' a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i 've been wearing it out . damn ! how did i miss this ? this is a great collection of snaky sweet , politically smart songs . `` doors of your heart '' ... i 've loved that song for years ... and `` too nice to talk to '' has always been a favorite . but every other single song on this cd , including the bonus tracks , is outstanding . these songs are textural wonders . great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording . i regret not discovering it sooner , but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact . oh yeah ... one more thing ... i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he 's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him . if he comes to a venue near you , do n't miss the show . you 'll get your money 's worth and more . wear your dancin ' shoes . he is truly one of the great talents of the 80 's and continues to make significant music . he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades . buy this cd . you wo n't regret it . it sounds best in the early evening . i 'm the big oh and i got ta go
1	o.g . ron c did a good job screwin ' choopin ' . he really gave the rest of tha u.s. a taste of texas ( tha lone star state ) . tha best time to listen to any screwed chopped music [ swishahouse , chamillitary , d.s.r . ( dirty south rydaz ) ] is you are throwed ( drunk ) off that syrup . this was a good thing that o.g . ron c did , choppin ' boyz up not sloppin ' boyz up . chamillitary man ! !
1	on this album , ice switches to a thrashcore style lovers of the style will go mad about.the songs are mega fast , with furious social lyrics and full of hatred.if you 're into thashcoreand dig bands like ratos de porao , get this one at once.it suffers from some degree of dynamic compression though , but if you can correct that , it 'll blow your brains againt the nearest wall
0	i have been listening to military band music for years , and am rarely disappointed . however , this compendium of music by the u.s. navy , army , and marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste . many of the arrangements are strange , and there is much too much vocal music when what i want to hear is the bands play . i would not have bought this album hhad i known beforehand what i know now
0	this cd had the makings of a great recording . the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch , please record another one but leave popper at home.he 's full of a lot of things , but talent is n't one of them
1	first , i 'd like to say that i am so glad there are artists like amel around who are n't trying to fit in with today 's commercial r scene . as a long time fan of r and soul music i ca n't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking , especially in regards to female singers . she may be beautiful , but she does n't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself . amel has a beautiful soul , and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics . every song on this album has at some point or another touched me , some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly . you know how sometimes when you 're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver ? amel 's got that down for me . i was firstly introduced to nusoul by teedra moses , someone who i 've admired for two years now , and who to me seemed one of the few decent r singers left . through teedra i stumbled on amel 's `` bravebird '' and became more and more curious as i listened to the album over and over . like with most nu/soul , the love i have for each song grew slowly , and songs i thought were n't for me suddenly became my favorites on the album . i love that about amel ; she makes me suprise myself , as i become emotionally involved with her music and voice over time until i 'm enchanted . `` for real '' hit me instantly as a beautiful song . i never get tired of it 's cute opening where amel 's daughter babbles something in baby talk ! i 'd love to talk about each song individually , but i 'd probably just bore you . to me amel 's music is a personal experience , and most likely strikes people in different ways . i will mention however , `` congo '' - one of the songs on there i was tempted to skip at first but has fast become something of an obsession which crops into my head throughout the days , with it 's monotonous jungle vibe . other personal favorites include `` we can be new '' , `` say you want it '' , `` all i got2 '' ... hell the whole album really . along with other outstanding artists of the nu-soul genre , amel has succesfully metamorphosised my taste in back music . trust me , you 'll never go back to commercial r again
0	this cd while full of nice music , is to me rather pointless . it 's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals . does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie ? aside from crazy train
0	la grange is probably at the top of most zz top fans lists , and rightly so as it is superb , but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track , which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording . it is so awful that i do n't know how anybody can listen to it . thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for rancho texicano . clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here , dummies . also , waitin ' on the bus/jesus just left chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
0	i bought this cd only yesterday.the recording level is too low and i could not listen to the performance even with the volume cranked fully up.rather than going in for another high wattage amplifier i decided to return the cd ! !
1	one reviewer remarked that morten veland had `` done it again . '' yup , he shot himself in the foot again , just like he did on tristania 's `` beyond the veil . '' veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements , and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians . his problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect , where it 's appropriate , he just plasters it everywhere , and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible cd . with all of the talent that is present in this band , it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more . the songs where veland does that ( which are all too few ) , like `` on the wane , '' are easily the cd 's best moments . to the band 's credit , the songs are more varied than on botv , with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs ( especially at the beginning of the opening track ) . it 's definitely still melodic goth-metal , but shows some new directions for veland , which i find promising . now , if he would just cut back on the growling ... say to 50 % of the cd ... sirenia 's next cd will be a sure winner
0	i ca n't believe none of the other reviews of the ultra lounge series state that these cd 's contain almost all instrumental music , with very few songs that feature vocals . i expect a lounge music cd to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks , and of the four ultra lounge cd 's i purchased , i count only three songs with vocals on all four of them . while the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music , they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them . the titles of the ultra lounge cd 's ( such as bachelor pad or bossanova ) mean very little , as each cd fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks . the best lounge cd i have heard so far is from an unlikely source . i purchased it at pottery barn , and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs . keep this in mind when buying lounge music cd 's so that you wo n't be disappointed the way i was with the ultra lounge series
0	lou reed rocks ! ! ! dude ! ! but methinks this collection dost not . the tunes are all good , but there are n't very many of them , and the sound is deplorable , in that inimitable rca-first-cd-edition sort of way ( fans of the jefferson airplane and harry nilsson know what i 'm talking about ) . a much better jumping off point would be `` different times : lou reed in the 70 's '' , or , even better , check out `` transformer '' or `` rock 'n ' roll animal ''
0	although it kills me to write anything less than glowing about edwin mccain ( i think he 's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we 've seen in the last ten years ) , i just can not get into this album . like others have said , i too have every edwin album and have seen him in concert . i love everything he 's ever done ... . but this album just does n't do it for me . and i know people will say ... `` give the album a chance '' ... .. or ... `` let edwin grow and move in new musical directions '' . but ... .. i 've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it 's just not growing on me . it feels `` flat '' and just does n't feel edwin-ish ( if that makes any sense ) . even grammercy park hotel , which i saw him debut live and which is on his live dvd does n't feel the same on here ... . just does n't have the feeling or soul . i would pick up austin sessions over this album any day . that is edwin doing what he does best . maybe he feels the pressure to write some `` hits '' so that he does n't have to spend two solid years on the road in the black pearl ( his tour bus ) ... .. and who could blame him ? ? ? but this feels like he 's trying too hard . i soooooo hope he comes back with a better album next time , so i can rave about it , because although i gave this album 2 stars ... . edwin , as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10 ! ! ! ! ! !
1	the album is straight raw . kurupt 's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with daz 's delivery . the g-funk beats are the best they 've ever sounded . as a whole , you will not skip one song at all . a+
0	when will artist realize you ca n't change the old classics . the only successfull r group to sing the classic `` night and day '' to their own beat was the temptations cd `` what women want '' the best rendition i have ever heard . smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs . another good cd with classics is willie nelson 's stardust
1	1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland . just like their other fellow ohion 's devo , the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.i have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and i have never grown tired of this album . i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago , if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it , it just would'nt happen . there is just a certain magic that they captured in 1978 , as to the music itself i tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts . side one being the more accessible `` drunken '' side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise , but a little too intelligent , just listen to the lyrics.side 2 is definately the `` drug '' side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland ( i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric ) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.i could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize , experience and consume at your own leisure , and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you . so if you loved things like throbbing gristle 's song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu 's album the mordern dance.as another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.i also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a few.so if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album , even if you have to beg , steal or borrow it .
0	mississippi and sugar baby are great songs , up there with the best dylan has done . however , the rest of the album , while listenable , is n't all that memorable . still , i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still , after over 40 years performing and recording . the same can not be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones . overall , time out of mind was better , although that too was a little overrated , with only not dark yet , standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs .
0	if i ca n't buy the cd with all the songs that were played in the movie then i wo n't buy it . i know one cd could cover the entire movie so why ca n't this be done ? does it concern copy rights and releases
1	gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james , ernest tubb , and dottie west . i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs . it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should . every song is great but the one which i really like is `` the old man and his horn '' . this was a song i had never heard . it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections . he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard
1	this is an amazing , beautiful album . probably a little more difficult to get into than streethawk , but after about the 4th or 5th listen , i found it more rewarding . the music is very dense , and the lyrics are beautifully poetic ( it helps that dan bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time ) . a great album for any fan of intelligent independent music
1	dream is a great album where keller coloboarates with many of his favorite musicians including bob wier , bella fleck , victor wooten and string cheese incident . all the songs are unique and great to sing too while driving or anytime !
0	it really does n't appeal to me . but if you like them that is your opinion . i 'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me . but i just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking i mean the creativity here is not very high i just feel you could use better words . but i mean the measure of a man is not how many girls you slept with . i mean that is how you lose money on child support . sex has never been the most important thing in life . honestly though i mean you just ca n't see these guys rapping about these same things when they 're 40 right cause that is wrong . i mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together
1	my 8-month-old son and i listen to this cd every night , and by the pachelbel canon ( track 7 ) he 's usually sound asleep . it is not all synthesizer . the jacket clearly states that the `` music box orchestra '' includes flute , piano , cello , percussion , english horn , and oboe . as a musician , i am not offended by the `` easy-listening '' versions of these classics . in fact , i enjoy them . they introduce my son to the timeless melodies without overstimulating him at bedtime . i find them relaxing too
1	considered one of coltrane 's 'searching ' periods , this cd has a lot to offer in the way of understanding trane 's restless nature . never one to stand on laurels , coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher ' every time out . this one is mostly ballad and blues based , with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the trane spectrum . track # 2 , `` i love you '' finds him playing furious , cerebral runs on the instrument , and , frankly , not as 'listenable ' as one may like ; whereas the track with donald byrd is as 'in the pocket ' as you 'll ever hear . all in all , a very realistic look at a genius in motion
0	in the past , i used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience . i 'd be introduced to band , not like it , and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me ' . the forecast , however , has changed how i feel . i , personally , love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy , but only because i was introduced to jimmy eat world and spitalfield a couple of years back . those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole , and expand my emo knowledge . imagine though , if you will , that i was new to emo . you , in theory , hand me a copy of `` late night conversations '' and tell me to listen . of course , i hate it , and lose any interest i may have had in the genre . to make a long story short , the only good that came out of 'late night conversations ' ( an underproduced , generic , stale piece of s**t ) was the revelation that came post-listen . never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you 're introduced to ( from said entire genre ) . not every metal band is iron maden . not every punk-pop band is blink 182 . not every nu-metal band is linkin park . not every 'emo ' band is jimmy eat world . every aspect of music has it 's ups and downs , and the forecast is clearly one of the downs . now that i 've bored you with an entire rant about nothing , i 'd like you to pass on 'late night conversations ' . with your help , the forecast wo n't sell another record , and , in turn , leave the scene forever . not recommended , duh
0	after months of searching , i found the out of print cd here . i had never heard it , but after hearing the fabulous song `` my only '' from the `` good as it gets '' movie soundtrack , i had to hear the album . what a disappointment ! oh well , it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
1	actually have n't heard this cd , yet , i can still comment on part of it . i was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the x-ray cafe . sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking , `` i wonder if they ever did anything with those masters ? '' so , i was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out ( which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour , but they knew the x-ray was special and gave it their all ) - it was all captured on these recordings . the machine was a tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings . most all the mics were either shure sm57/58 , but there was also a high quality shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage . the x-ray was perfect for this type of recording . the tiny pa was only used for the vocals , so , there was no competing with a pa blasting everything . i would place a sm-57 close to every amp . had a nice specialtiy bass mic , too . usually , 8 channels was enough to catch everything , but , there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed . because of the overhead stereo catching the drums , this was rarely needed . with a full house , such as the night with the gits , any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd , creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space . there was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the x-ray `` business office '' next door , which is where the tascam was setup away from any real danger . all of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show . every once in a while , magic happened . d. fletcher portland , or
0	this is a pep rally on cd ; an unsingable , emotionally charged pep rally . it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music . the melodies are not easily singable at all , and the songs use all the same musical cliches . this is worship manipulation at it 's best . if you read the words to learn something concrete about god , you will find nothing of substance . they talk about actions to give god and our response to god , but no meat-and-potatoes of why we should be doing this . god is great , but why ? this is very disturbing , and completely unacceptable for congregational worship .
1	this might be the best cd that has come out this year . it may be will oldham 's best cd since `` viva last blues . '' it may be better than `` viva last blues '' although these are two different styled cds . `` the letting go '' has a mostly very mellow sound . almost every song is beautiful . the string and guitar melodies are uplifting . will oldham 's voice is grounding , it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so . dawn mccarthy 's voice will then again lift you up . mccarthy 's voice is a fantastic companion to oldham 's . other singers/bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating . this is not the case with `` the letting go , '' mccarthy 's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from oldham . i have n't listened to a will oldham album since `` ease down the road . '' this makes me want to go back and listen to those albums i have missed . one song in particular , `` the seedling '' ( i believe ) has a different sound than the rest of the album . it has a harsher sound , but is still a good song . this is a great introduction if you are new to oldham or if you are returning listener .
1	this is jewel 's first cd and i enjoyed it especially foolish games and you were meant for me . i ca n't wait for her latest
1	first off , to the above comments , while i thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons , and would be interested to read other history lessons from you , you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 spartans at thermopolye , but of the graphic novel . now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense , but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself . **** caution spoiler alert ***** besides that the soundtrack is amazing and it is always a joy to listen to a soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that particular scene , i especially enjoyed the music when they fight the `` beasts '' and it is really hard rock , and i especially loved the ending music when the entire spartan army is gathered and the one spartan is telling them to remember leonidas ( it is called remember us on the soundtrack ) . may we all find our own `` glorius death
1	i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers , and i thought it was astonishing . i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything , i mean it could n't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that ! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time . farina ( the lead singer ) has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean . the drummer just flat out rocks . his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight . the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion . well , if you have a problem with a band not rocking out , i dont know what to tell you . it is jazzy , but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i 've heard . i think this is the only path they could of taken . you got to evolve . sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case , karate is the exception . love this
0	i bought this cd because i figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites . well , i 'd like to say i loved it , but i didnt . this cd just comes off as flat and lifeless . where as the original songs , the kyle toucher on vocals versions , had a certain edge , the remakes make great material sound very mediocre . for those of you first discovering dr. know , l this may be the greatest cd in the world ... the material is that good-but , if you really want to experience dr. know , buy their best of cd that was released on mystic records . this is the best version of dr. know . hope this helps
1	it 's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there , but thank halstead co. for proving me wrong . i am happily pleased with their latest , and very eagerly awaited , effort . instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on , say , out of tune , they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically `` it 's good , everything 's going just way ok ... '' it 's happy . maybe i 'll hear a lyric later that says something else , but for those for whom music is the priority , you ca n't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop . four and a half stars
1	after leaving ( or being dismissed from ) pink floyd in 1968 due to his lsd use erratic behaviour , singer/songwriter/guitarist syd barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album , `` the madcap laughs . '' the album did not come easy , as syd never fully recovered from his drug use , and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on `` madcap laughs . '' producer malcolm jones did what he could with syd for about half of the album , before handing the production reigns over to barrett 's former floyd mates roger waters david gilmour to finish the job . throughout the album , bum notes are played , beats are missed , and barrett sings off-key . and on the rocker songs , the session players ( from the group the soft machine ) sound like they are struggling to keep up with syd , who could hit a rough patch at any moment . for any other artist , this would all be nothing short of disastrous . and yet ... .in the case of syd barrett , any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven . why ? because barrett 's songs on `` the madcap laughs '' are all wonderfully written , and although syd 's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition , you can plainly hear on this album that he 's trying . he 's really , really *trying* to do his best , and his efforts really do shine through . for every bum note there 's a passage that syd plays beautifully , for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule , and for every note that syd sings off-key , there are many moments where his very distinctive , british voice is magical . and of course , there 's syd 's lyrics . you may not know what all of them actually *mean* , really , but to my ears , they 're still poetry . the rockers are still powerful ( `` no good trying , '' `` no man 's land , '' the rockabilly fun of `` here i go , '' and the classic `` octopus '' ) , and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ( `` terrapin , '' the passionate `` dark globe , '' the effective `` golden hair '' -- -based on a james joyce poem -- -and `` long gone '' ) . even the more ragged numbers like `` feel '' and `` if it 's in you , '' somehow still hang together quite well ( amusingly , we even hear some brief banter from syd in the middle of `` if it 's in you , '' as his voice goes wildly off the map , he stops playing , prepares for another take , and finally gets through the song ) . when all is said and done , `` the madcap laughs , '' warts and all , is an excellent album . it is a flawed masterpiece , and it shows that syd barrett , even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point , was still a genius musician .
0	based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish , jason falkner and the beatles , i was expecting a lot better . instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to . is the guy talented musically ? yes . but his voice is mediocre and his songs really do n't do it for me . sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others wo n't be mislead by the breathless reviews here . i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre
1	`` vangelis : themes '' is a collection of some rare and some more popular theatrical theme music from movies including `` blade runner '' and `` mutiny on the bounty . '' it 's an extraordinary album and i highly recommend it
1	joe bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music . in his musical style/class , i would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with walter trout weighing in first place . as you can easily see from all of the other reviews , i believe that you will find this cd well worth purchasing - as i have found all his material is . ( after purchasing this item , i eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and have n't been disappointed . ) as with any cd , you may not like all the selections but i believe the vast majority of his material you will . among my favorites on this cd are : `pack it up ' , `you upset me baby ' , and `man of many words ' . bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician . since he is young and gifted , we can expect many more superb cd 's in the future . highly recommended
1	the first time you play this cd you 're just gon na hate it . promise ring 's third album is the opposite of this . very emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick , there 's just not much there . that understood , this album will rock you for years . it grows on you . at first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos . like the faceless band you saw open for fugazi the last time they hobbled into town . no hooks , no choruses , lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [ with the drums mixed way too loud , an emo thing ] . on the 100th listen , if you make it that far , it will sound like an old friend yammerin ' on about the good old days . trust me , it 's a desert island disc in the making , i envy those of you just discovering this cd
1	the earlier reviews pretty much said it all ; this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the 90s . swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often , however , if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band , because they are n't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock . yes , rock . who knew it could still be done , and believe me , they do it well , and uniquely . if you 've listened to swervedriver before , then tehre is n't too much more to say - buy this album . it 's not as hi-fi as 99th dream or mezcal head ( in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade ) , but not as fast or dirty as raise . now , if you have never listened to swervedriver , this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes . personally , i would suggest starting with 99th dream or mezcal head ; either way , this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album - great lyrics , superb and unique songs , and that urge for more when it 's over . sadly , this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together ( however , some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway ) . but if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so , if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - swervedriver is a must
0	can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music ? ive listened to many bob dylan albums , and every one is a gem . freewheelin ' is my favorite , but so what ? it does n't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan 's worst record was , and its saved . im not one to question this man 's beliefs or anything like that , bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe , but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is ? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
1	for a true christian spirit that glows through ms. winans , you 'll always find her music sung straight from the heart . a precious pearl in the gospel community , `` purified '' continues in the cece tradition , of lifting our souls to a higher plain
0	this is the cheesiest music ever . phil collins , glenn frey , chaka khan ? are you kidding me ? these were the worst artists of the 80 's . where 's u2 , rem , the pixies , x , the pretenders , tom petty , prince , springsteen , the replacements , husker du ? does anyone like rock and roll ? phil collins writes songs for disney and pixar now ! what did glenn frey know about 'smugglers blues ' ? do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart ? these are the worst artists , songwriters and performers of the 80 's . enjoy the nostalgia , but the art which is song is seriously missing on this cd .
1	this is what i grew up with on the radio , and listened to at the dance halls . this is not some sissy nashville sound .
0	i wrote a review but i guess it was so bad for ultramagnetic , amazon booted it . the album is trash . nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago . but do n't take my word for it , sample for yourself . ahead of their time ? faith no more . what can i say about this album without my review getting kicked off amazon again ? i 've used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does . 1988 's critical beatdown never , ever gave that kind of deliverance . that 's why that 's a classic and the best kept secret is not , by any means ( vocally , production , lyrically , concept ) . can i get a witness ? please ? dj moe luv is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old ultramagnetic sound alive here on `` vibrato '' and `` mechanism nice ( born twice ) '' the album 's 1st single . ced-gee kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene ( never heard that on critical beatdown by ced ) . kool keith does fine on solo track `` late nite rumble '' but kool keith is goin ' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs , his delivery is sounding just like ced 's towards the end of the album . t.r . love ? m.i.a . you see him in photos , you hear silence from him , he does n't even produce a track . production by ced , moe and 2 others and the other 2 sound like kutmasta kurt producing ( producer for most of kool keith solo stuff ) . i do not mean that in a good way . the beats of `` nottz '' is bangin ' , the lyrics by both keith and ced should raise eyebrows on what 's next to come for the best kept secret being the b-side to the 1st single `` mechanism nice ( born twice ) '' . songs like `` ai n't it good 2 u '' ( 2007 ) and `` party started '' are for gentleman 's clubs for the girls to dance to . now do you see what direction this album is goin ' ? if you 're lookin ' for ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and/or the masterful , brainiac , monkey wrench lyricism as critical beatdown ; funk your head up and the four horsemen albums gave you over a decade ago , you will not find it here . maybe in the next 14 years . right ultramag
1	anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie , when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other , when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life ? right before he enters the bus ... i would love to listen to it again but i ca n't find it anywhere..
0	the remix is totally devoid of any taste : first the vocals are completely-off ; the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings . secondly , there is absolutely no respect on part of the `` mixing djs '' for the great vocalists : there is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together ' of the music with the vocals . i was deeply disappointed with this cd.if you are into remixes get the rod stewart `` do ya think i am sexy '' single cd instead
0	i bought usher 's 8701 on tape long ago , and i remember liking it . then a couple of years ago , i bought it again on cd , listened to it , and wondered why i wasted my money . maybe it 's the fact that i 've grown , but this album sounds so un-soulful now . it is just lacking any spirit , sort of like an over-produced record : all studio magic , but no magic from the singer . even the songs that are supposed to sound heartfelt , do n't . the album sounds dated , not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics . the songs are very forgettable , and i do n't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now . usher has yet to make a masterpiece . addendum : i was a little unfair in my rating . the album deserves 3 stars , not 2 . unfortunately , i ca n't change it .
0	can we say , `` money making ploy ? '' wow . i , like many others , have grown up with disney . perhaps i simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs ? this is not like `` kidz bop '' or anything related to that which `` kidifies '' music - these are timeless movie classics that did not need to be redone - and as a further insult , they are poorly redone . i am very , very let down by these `` disneymania '' albums . : o (
1	in boyz ii men 's sophomore album , ii , they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer dallas austin and founder michael bivins . this lp begins with the deepest of gratitude on `` thank you '' produced by the group and dallas austin . both `` all around the world '' and `` u know '' are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them , but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights . one thing they do is provide another angle for boyz ii men . for a more relaxing environment , `` vibin ' '' has a rather simple instrumentation , lyrics and vocals . `` i sit away '' is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by tony rich and production by veteran l.a. reid and tony rich . stepping into a more modern jazz feel `` jezzebel '' strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal . over a piano solo , boyz ii men harmonize on `` khilil ( interlude ) '' to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with `` trying times '' written and produced by wanya morris , tim kelley bob robinson . hit maker babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights `` i 'll make love to you '' and `` water runs dry '' . heavyweights jimmy jam terry lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on `` on bended knee '' . `` 50 candles '' drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content `` ... feels like one of those nights ... '' they show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on `` yesterday '' they perform accapella . if real talent that you seek , members shawn , michael , nathan and wanya has uncompromising talent for any age , era , or time that you can enjoy for long time .
0	the songs are boring , the lyrics are plain . i am so dissapointed . i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song . how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me . andrea 's solo album sucked . now this ! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again , i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album . instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc
0	sinceramente , no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas , incluso renombrados artistas , hacia este musico ... ungido de la leyenda grape , amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura , esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima , piedad , curiosidad ... no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson ( 13th ... .. ) .. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin , son opiniones , nada mas .
1	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about . great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears . spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well . they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting . some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind , the two sides of monsieur valentine , sister jack and i turn my camera on . i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock . definately money well spent
1	great trip down memory lane . had forgotten that paul davis had recorded some of the songs . `` i still go crazy '' is one of the best songs ever
1	i just saw the movie and throughly enjoyed the performance by all the actors involved . kevin spacey has a velvety , smooth voice . i was surprised to learn his background is in musicals . he has a beautiful voice and in this movie , it rocks ! ! ! love the music ! i highly recommend you buying the cd and the dvd
1	i have seen al jarreau 20 times in concert ( and recently saw al and george perform at the hollywood bowl ) and am a long-time fan from way back . there are a few al cds that you just play forwards and backwards ( and back when they were cassettes , you wore out the tape ) because they 're just perfect . `` breakin ' away '' , `` jarreau '' and `` heaven and earth '' come to mind . well , add `` givin ' it up '' to that list . if you 're an old-school al fan and you 're wondering whether to buy this cd , buy it . it will live up to all of your al expectations . there 's a `` look the rainbow '' feel to it , there 's a `` breakin ' away '' feel to it , there 's a `` jarreau '' feel to it . there 's even a `` glow '' feel to it ( when you think about tunes like `` milwaukee '' and `` have you seen the child ? '' ) . grassroots al . it 's got the production values of `` heaven and earth '' and `` tenderness '' . fabulous production , arrangements , gathering of talent . there is not one song on here that you will skip as you 're listening to it driving to work or whatever . in fact , if you 're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood , put on this cd because between everybody from chris botti to jill scott to a soulful paul mccartney , people will stop and say , `` wow , listen to jill and george tearing up 'god bless the child . ' '' and `` is that paul mccartney tearing up 'bring it on home to me ' ? '' [ yes , it is . ] meanwhile , al and george are working their magic the entire time , and guests will say , `` listen to george right there . '' and , `` al is jamming right now . '' it 's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party : fabulous music that people must comment on . of course , that 's where the conversation picks right back up , so you win either way . the blend is perfect : just a touch of scatting , just a touch of voice-beat , with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both al and george , tons of great music solos , and george playing a perfect guitar . if you 're a george benson fan , you will be thrilled with this cd because george provides a fabulous through-line to every piece . he 's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar . he fronts many of the pieces , and he 's not in any way relegated to `` background guitarist . '' he is the music in every piece , with few exceptions . as much as i love al , this cd is magical because of the blend of george and al . only these two can pair up to make this kind of cd . there is no other team who could have pulled this off . you need al 's voice and george 's guitar . period . in fact , i 'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply genius this cd is , as in , `` dang . these two are great together . wow . '' bottom line : this is a perfect blend of these two greats ' talents . george takes care of the music , while al provides the wide gamut of vocals he 's an expert at ( and that only he can provide ) . if you 've been a long-time fan of either of these two , you wo n't be disappointed . it 's not lopsided . and it 's old-school in every good way . my prediction : this cd will sweep the grammys . if it does n't , there is no justice . like another reviewer on this page , i intend to buy this cd for about eight people . it 's just that perfect
0	i do n't even own this cd , and after seeing the reviews i do n't want it . 90 % of the `` 5 star '' reviews are people with only one review . suspicious ? ? look for yourself , it 's right there to see . i have some other meditation cds that are very repetitive , i 'm not going to make the same mistake here , especially with such shameless self-promotion
1	i like every song but 1 on this cd . they 're the same ones that 're on the movie and if you do n't like the movie , you probably would n't like the cd
0	not exactly the `` vaults '' blowing open , as stated in the promo . these are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s , when the group was on hiatus from serious recording . that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows , literary journals and graphic design firms . whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected , such as `` reprehensible '' , `` rest awhile '' and `` certain people i could name '' . but there are too few of these real songs , and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career
0	the cd came as promised and in the condition promised . i 'm very satisfied
0	we all know how great the songs are on this cd -- 5-star all the way . however , i guess there 's an unlucky few oddballs among us who ca n't play the sacd hybrid cd format of this particular reissue on our pc . which also means that we ca n't add the cd to our itunes or ipod music selections . in this day and age , that 's severely limiting , so i regret this purchase ( i do n't have some jalopy of a pc/processor either , as my computer is less than seven months old , with 2gb of ram ) . i do n't know who to blame for my `` mistake '' -- myself ? amazon ? sony ? philips ? abkco ? i 'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding `` dsd- '' or `` sacd- '' labeled items . i 'll also give the cd 1 star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me
0	very possibly the worst cd i have ever heard in my life . i could barely force myself to listen until the last song was blissfully over . this is not music . it is stupid noise !
1	this album gives me goosebumps . i got it because of eric dolphy , but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than eric dolphy alone ( though he 's excellent as usual ) . the inclusion of booker ervin gives the album the perfect texture , as his style in many ways contradicts that of dolphy . although the styles are different , they complement each other perfectly . mal waldron is a great composer , and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album . the song `` thirteen '' is a fine example ... you 'll just have to listen to it . everyone on this album smokes . get this ... you wont regret it
0	any one who is a fan of luther vandross will be sorry if you purchase this cd . it 's not a tribute ... ... .it an abomination
1	bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most creative . on this album , he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning . `` move '' has a smaller , more focused sound that it 's predecessors , and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music . bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around - this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion . bravo !
1	hell rell did his job , i was n't expecting anything as good as this . hell rell outdid himself .
0	hate to say it , but this is pretty drab stuff . that said , i 'm hardly about to complain ; how could i ? this was obviously written for a film ( that i have no interest in seeing ) , and mogwai just released 'mr . beast ' , a solid ( if unspectacular ) album earlier this year . i kind of see 'zidane ' as a gift , then . looking at the whole thing from that perspective , it 's impossible to be letdown . but then , retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult . mogwai , when channeling the right energies , create sublime , beautiful music -- truly as beautiful as any form of modern music , to my ears . when they 're a bit more ambiguous , though , the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction . 'zindane ' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent , but the result is surprisingly dull -- at best , it 's pretty ; at worst , it 's utterly monotonous . the ideas are here , too ; it 's not that 'zindane ' lacks drive or intent . it is a focused work . yet , it 's obvious , i think , that the music , contrary to most film scores , desires to refrain from emotional manipulation . while that 's admirable , i find that musically , i 'd much rather be manipulated than dazed ; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers . there are a few nice themes and motifs , do n't get me wrong , but this is all underscore -- mogwai , in the best way possible , has a great gift at handling melodrama , and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light . i wo n't sway anyone from attempting to get 'zidane ' , but i would n't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration . no , for that , i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums . for , mogwai is a band , after all -- they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone . for those unaware , mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film 'the fountain ' -- though they did not write any of the actual material , from what i 've gathered -- and as a musical experience , the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows 'zidane ' out of the water . in my opinion , it even beats out 'mr . beast ' , so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai 'oughta check that one out for sure
0	not his best stuff . he 's running short of lyrical ideas , he recycles his own lines , like star wars recycles `` i have a bad feeling about this '' . beats are usually cool , i do n't care for the popish tracks with the singing . i did n't mind it so much when he sang really bad back on his first album , but now it 's no longer funny , it sounds like pop . anyhow , organized religion is crap . i thought krs understood this back in the day . what happened ? now he 's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy , and his only little diciples and crap , i dunno , it 's posative , but then again it 's gay like some of his modern tracks . anyhow it is cheap , if you have to finish off your collection as i do , then buy it , otherwise go buy his anything boombap on back . or check out : kool keith el-p gang starr mr. lif jedi miind tricks public enemy non phixion sir menelik most of which is better than krs ' latest works
1	three six mafia has out done there self with this new guy chrome about every song is decent which is hard to find these days
1	its a pretty good mix , good song choices , its mostly a harder mix , thought it could be smoother flowing though , but all in all its pretty good , also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining , it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd , but hey people got ta switch it up now and then , like the last 3/4s better ...
0	there was only one good song on the disk dont waste your mone
0	in many ways a relic of its era , `` not of this earth '' is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani ( a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of `` time machine '' , years later ) . the guitarist , supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai , a former student of satriani , ended up singing his teacher 's praises in the music press . the result is that this album , more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music , received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record . the album itself is a bit uneven -- satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist , but as a songwriter , he was n't quite ready . several pieces ( `` not of this earth '' , `` hordes of locusts '' ) seem to run out of steam before they end , and a couple ( `` the snake '' , `` driving at night '' ) feel like bad '80s metal . on the other hand , several pieces shine -- delicate and lovely `` rubina '' , reggaeish and emotionally soaked `` memories '' , and the overtly frippesque `` new day '' are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of . but my favorite is probably `` brother john '' , where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone . in the end , the album is ok , but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future . come back to this one if you 've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more , but most should start with `` surfing with the alien ''
0	i really , really hate foreigner and i rank them as bad as green day.dont make the mistake of buying this disgustingly awful cd which contains trash like waiting for a girl like you which has to be one of the most moronic and stupid songs ever.get any led zeppelin album instead
1	i usually do n't do album reviews but i got ta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call `` the sauce '' so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings . word of mouth is bliss . a-g-2-a-ke who came out on rap-a-lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic . i 'm salty they did n't `` make it '' because this was heavily slept on
1	there have been innumerable motorhead collections over the years , but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new . on this collection , all the classics are present , and some newer material is thrown in as well . unfortunately , there are some throw-away tracks , mainly the girlscool and headgirl tracks . ( to be honest , these tracks are pretty much worthless . ) some live tracks are meshed in and fit well , and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff . i would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice , cheap collection of some of motorhead 's best just for the sake of getting into the band . but if you 're wanting the prime collection of older material , save up some extra dough and buy `` no remorse '' or `` stone deaf forever .
1	this is my favorite jazz album of all time . put simply , this was miles davis at his best . the notes on this album simply float , and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard . the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense . do n't let the thirty second clips fool you . i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading . i took a chance on it , and it was the best gamble i 've ever made . a must have for any jazz enthusiast
1	another great album by firehouse . my favorites are reach for the sky , when i look into your eyes , and hold your fire . i have other favorites , but there are my top 3 . i have a story to go along with this album , ladies and gentlemen . see , i was heading to cross-country one day , for the huge `` group 2 '' meet . ( there 's a section , and 5 groups from every section make it , and there were four sections , so you can make the calculations ) . i listened to this album , having a bad day before , and having a bad night of rest . listening to this album , i got a river of positivity , and i had a great start and a great finish . i ended up smashing my last personal best in cross-country . basically ladies and gentlemen , this cd has alot of effect . get it . i love to review things . have a great day
0	i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd , demon days . the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so `` out there '' that when you first hear one of their cd 's ... it sounds like complete garbage . but once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . eventually you end up really liking the cd . that was the case with demon days . after enjoying that cd fully , i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd , and i did n't like it all that much . there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd . way too much of it sounds like complete filler . there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days , but most of the stuff on that cd was great . here , we 've got songs that are just ... boring . nothing happens . i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( such as on songs like new genious , man research , and starshine . ) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all , sometimes sounding just like static noise . songs like this , such as double bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . it gets boring . other songs , like 5/4 , m1 a1 , and rock the house are catchy at first , but just do n't have staying power . they get old . 5/4 got annoying quickly , m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly , and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . and songs like latin simone are just annoying . the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable , although 19-2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . there are some good songs here , though . tomorrow comes today , clint eastwood , gravity , 19-2000 , and left hand suzuki method are cool songs . slow country 's kind of cool , too . and dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . this small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . much of this cd just is n't really that good . i do n't know ... this cd just seemed empty . very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes ( ! ) longer than demon days ) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff . people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up , demon days , instead of this one . if i listened to this debut cd first , i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much . the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump ; their cds are getting better , not worse . that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band .
1	studio album released in 1971 , by the original band-a real band with alice cooper , neal smith , dennis dunaway , michael bruce , and glen buxton . i think the other band members ( apart from cooper ) , got the short end of the stick . this album , along with these 'love it to death ' , 'billion dollar babies ' , and 'love it to death ' are so vastly superior to 'his ' other albums . the band plays and writes really well together as a 'real ' band . case in point , listen to 'dada ' from a few years later-dreadful ! just wish he had kept a proper band together , even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians . rock is about feel , more than technique in my opinion . i ca n't even listen to 'dada ' or
0	i do n't know who these people are , but they will give praise for anything ! ms. london is a wonderful singer , but the producers must have given her sleeping pills . this is a boring cd ! like peggi blu , who won star search , her record company `` toned her down '' for her debut album , with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop `` dum de dum '' mary j. blige beat , which will send you to nowheresville . aretha franklin 's boring so damn happy was so awful , it 's no longer available . she went `` mary j . '' and almost lost the crown off her head . because she 's aretha franklin ( queen of soul ) she did manage ( somehow ) to get a non-deserved grammy for `` wonderful '' from that cd . the grammys also presented the queen with her 17th competitive grammy for her `` a house is not a home '' mess . what must they be thinking ? well , latoya london wo n't be considered for anything for this hip/hop mess . she should get serious about some r b ( i mean the real r b ) and leave this light-weight fluff alone . latoya , you have a great voice -- use it . contact sam dees , jo armstead or ashford simpson and beg for some material ! and , as madame rose would say , `` sing out , louise ! ! !
1	i was first touched by pavarotti 's voice as a teenager in the early 80 's when i saw a pbs special of this concert on television . the power of his voice and his personality are incomparable . his rendition of ave maria is especially touching . i would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience , as i was so many years ago
0	this album is a real let down and it pains me to say so , since i really do like the kol . the first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked . i did n't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling . it did n't matter because the songs were great.but on this cd they 've opted for an experimental sound that does n't measure up . innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in charmer-what the heck is up with that ? how often do you want to listen to it ? once was enough for me . i was n't expecting the pixies here . and then there 's the reverb employed on song after song-why ? it just degenerates into white noise . there are a couple of good tracks on the dics- black thumbnail , for one . but then there are throwaway tunes like camaro , which is about as clique as you can get . that said , art is subjective , and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews . but i find most of it unlistenable.i can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating ; this is definitely not one of them
0	( ... ) this cd is sub-par . most of the beats are cool , but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics
0	the raising arizona part of the cd is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that i remember from the movie . i recommend listening to samples before you buy
1	the more i listen to this album , the more i love it . what 's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening . like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package . this is one cooooool cd .
0	i never could understand why the beatles are so popular ? they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd . each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds . i just dont like it because it sucks ! dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below . the beatles only made one good album and that 's the one which contains ballad of john and yoko , hey jude .
0	so this is the winner of plop idol from the u.k then . well they do n't come prettier than this from scotland i guess , that 's for sure . as far as the music is concerned , avoid ! it 's nothing but a calchony of crap . perhaps michelle should stick at something she is good at - eating chips and mars bars
1	leo kottke is a national treasure . he is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso . having said that , you 'd expect his cds to be at a very high level of brilliance . i have at least a dozen of his titles . if there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc , it 's because there are so many kottke releases to choose from . `` one guitar , no vocals '' clearly ranks as one of the best . the compositions tickle my brain , warm my heart , and put a bounce into my step . the guitar playing is dazzling . you really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant , thoughtful , odd , complex , quirky , a huge heart , and the wackiest sense of humor . it 's spirited music , so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it 's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as leo . the world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days . some of them are quite excellent . many are not . but there is only one leo kottke . and his guitar music is a gift to the world . a very strong recommendation for this cd
0	look , i dig stand up , and i dig fat jokes , but this guy is n't that great . i got a friend who loves john pinette , but i ca n't see it . he tells jokes about how fat he is , how he likes to eat , how he does n't like to move . its the same over and over and over again . its dull and it 's too easy . they 're not even jokes , really , just comments on how fat he is . also a fair part of his act consists of `` asian people talk with accents and thats funny '' which i find cheap . stereotypes should n't be jokes , and even when they are , they should n't be the joke . john says something with broken english and the audience laughs really hard . why ? why is that funny , here in the 20th century ? maybe i just do n't `` get '' his humor , but i do n't think this guy is any good . i perfer comedians who tell jokes . on the plus side , this guy is clean , which is rare these days . but there are better clean comedians around . try getting a brian regan album or an emo philips album . jerry seinfelds album is good too . try those guys because they 're clean and legitimately funny
0	sounds like the background music used in the 70 's rockford files tv crime show ... and a little like the chips music too . similar to music by tom scott from back then . the crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky , they are more smooth groovin funk . the sound for the times is very clean , too produced for true funkyness . do n't get me wrong i like the old 60 's jazz crusaders , just not this 70 's phase of their career ... they sold out to a large extent , and continue to do so , it 's where the money is . no improvisatory feel either . this is for smooth jazz lovers . hard funk lovers will be disappointed , as will true jazzers . i wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60 's but they keep burying it like it never happened , even to this day , afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60 's true jazz albums . their 70 's albums like this are partly to blame for today 's smooth jazz ... in other words , not really jazz , not really funky , just kind of smooth groovin , more for casual adults and offices . not challenging , not offensive , formulated to an extent . but hey if you like this , that 's cool , just dont think it 's real jazz , or real funk . it 's smooth and casual , slightly simmers , pleasant background music , but does n't cook like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz , funk , and fusion . it just sounds like they are holding back ... i know they can play more advanced , and write more creatively , they just choose not to ever since the 60 's
1	this is a great classic rock cd including some timeless songs . if you like `` summer breeze '' as much as i do and have not heard the remix of it yet , you are in for a pleasent suprise . a remix album came out in november of 2004 called `` what is hip '' and in my opinion is the best remix album of 70 's music that i 've ever heard . their version of `` summer breeze '' is near perfect . a modernized , but not over the top version that manages to preserve the true melody of the song with out removing the original rhythm . the entire album is great too . i have this `` greatest hits '' and the `` what is hip '' cd and simply ca n't get enough . here 's a link to the cd . enjoy . http : //www.amazon.com -- what is hip
0	too lisa loeb for me . sorry . maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
1	okay bryce nickelback yells not screams big difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not scream at all and you say `` i like music '' well you dont know any thing about music and another thing you poser is that limp bizkit is not metal they rap so how can you say that they scream all the time ... limp bizkit is the worst band out their they give a bad name to music itself and as for you dont write anymore reviews until you know more about music wich with the information i just got from you that will take a long tim
1	bo diddley is one of the most underrated rock and roll artist . such gems as `` bo diddley '' `` say man '' and `` who do you love '' are just the tip of the iceberg . add in the blues , like `` i 'm a man '' and you have a truely outstanding set . the set also includes a very informative booklet that includes a bio , pictures and discography . do not settle for less than what is offered here
1	sensational is a word i 'd use to describe singer jesse mccartney . good looks and powerful vocals . he 's talented and sweet . if you have n't gotten a copy of his latest cd 'right where you want me ' , buy it today
0	listening to this album made me question my own life . it is simply unoriginal , boring and really bad . save your money
1	i am listening to badfinger even as i type this review . this is the best of badfinger vol 2 , and i thought volume 1 was great ! ! as previous reviewers have said , what an absolute tragedy the story of badfinger is ( buy the book `` without you '' the tragic story of badfinger ) . well i have everything they have released , if you do buy any of the badfinger best ofs , you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.some of the best songs on this cd are off `` wish you were here '' their best album by a mile imho.in fact 6 of the 9 songs on wywh are on this compilation . they were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song . just have a taste of `` just a chance '' , `` you 're so fine '' , `` meanwhile back at the ranch/should i smoke '' .they were just so good , damn i miss them
1	it tiptoes through the years and delivers the punch , but as i wrote in my review , i never thought shangri la was going to be the last , though it appears just that . but all in the suit , man , they did that after shangri la de and i wonder , if this was the direction to come , my god ! ! ! ! it 's worth it for that track alone.. 5 stars is my own way of saying thank you , but it is not just sentimental , the only album in the short career that was n't great was tiny music , but the quote `` trippin '' made up for it . it 's a shame it 's over . i do n't like revolver , it 's not evolution for weiland and i ca n't imagine him being happy there , it steps back and all i ever hoped was that someday this band , stp , would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation they deserve . all i can do is give stars , but i would rather buy another stp album or go see them live ... is rock dead ? i think it is and it went with this band
1	there is a reason why styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row ! find out why . they are a unique band , with their own uncatagorizable style and sound . not hard rock , but can rock . not pop , but catchy melodies and great three part harmony . not art rock , but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music . it is probably true that lady was the first power ballad , though styx was not credited for it . lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides . perhaps styx was not always successful in their attempts , but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so . every song on this cd is great ; however the two that stand out for me are too much time on my hands and suite madame blue . most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that too much time on my hands is witty , funny , and true . suite madame blue a song which is a metaphor for the united states is simply one of the greatest rock songs ever ! ! the lyrics of suite madame blue are as powerful as the music , and this song contains all the elements which made styx great
0	my dj side : i actually had to stop the music , open the tray on the cd player then check whether i had the right cd1 down-tempo in , or some other cd that my wife played before as the music was so not what i was expecting , sounding more like deep forest than jvm . to my surprise , it was jimmy 's balance 10 . i decided to keep an open mind and listen to it anyway . i went to sleep after the 4th track . the next day i decided to listen to the second cd ( mid tempo ) . again i stopped the music , opened the tray on the cd player then checked whether i had the ( mid tempo cd ) in instead of the down-tempo i was playing the night before . sure enough , the ( mid tempo ) was what i had in the player , but did not sound much different than the lullabies i was listening to on cd1 . when the mid-tempo was over , i thought to myself `` well , this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends '' . the next day i had high hopes for the up tempo cd , cause well , as the name implies , it should be where the beats and treats are . but no . not really . the only reason i did n't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd cd of jimmy van m 's balance release is because for three days i kept telling myself that there is an up tempo cd . i did n't mind cd12 out of place pop tracks , i did n't mind the different types of music being played in sequence , or rather , out of sequence . i did n't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel i stayed in two years ago in vienna . all this will be forgivable when i hear the up-tempo , because i was so sure it 's going to be awesome . unfortunately , i was not quite right about my assumptions . things did not start happening until track 5 ( the reducer 2 ) , i do n't really need some 4 tracks on the third cd to get me warmed up . jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that , in his down + mid-tempo crap . for the most part , this production of the balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic , way too slow and boring music that could be described , at best , as lullabies for grown ups . as for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo , it is actually - dare i say - decent enough , but way too late , and even worse , ended prematurely . it should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every cd to be as follows : ( cd3 ) up-tempo should have been ( cd1 ) renamed ( in the car from club to home ) , ( cd2 ) mid-tempo should have been renamed ( at home in the living room ) and finally ( cd1 ) down-tempo should have been ( cd3 ) renamed ( in your bedroom ) . this just makes more sense . the reason i say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us ( 9 ) to the rest of the sleepy , mellow ones ( 41 ) . for example , chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually . i have never come across a chill cd that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones , that 's not chill . jvm balance did exactly that ; took forever to ascend to a certain point , then crashed almost immediately . what gives ? half star for cd1 half star for cd2 3 stars for cd3 my human side : dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there , duh ! jimmy made that very clear in this release . if you want to listen to a wide range of ( not bad ! ) music , then balance 10 is for you . dive in jvm selection of what he thinks makes us human ; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive . as a matter of fact , we do n't even need music ( or any type of arts for that matter ) to survive at all . still we listen to it , we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it . music can represent our feelings , desires and wishes , and with jvm deep forest like music here ( as i mentioned before ) i ca n't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority . i think it shows .
0	the `` drummer '' ( more like `` the anti-drummer '' ) on this is johnny cresci . he is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability , and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is . how he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time . for me , mr. `` clueless '' cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking ... ..kinda like driving an aston martin with a flat tire ! i have tried to get beyond cresci 's chops for over a year of listening now , and i simply ca n't do it . if you 're a musician , his playing will make you extremely agitated . i 'm gon na have to trade this in , and go on listening to live adventures like i have for the past 37 years . this would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers . granted , this is an historically significant release , but i think it should have stayed in the vault , or released with johnny cresci having been digitally removed or replaced
1	i bought this album when it was first released in the 70 's . heaven and hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know ' in much the same way that a joint would these days . the movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures . only later in life could i get the similarities to carl orf and khachaturian . this is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when prog really was prog . listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside camel 's 'the snow goose ' , the original 'tubular bells ' by mike oldfield , 'brain salad surgery ' by elp and finally ' snowflakes are dancing ' by tomita . please dont compare this work to the keybored pop , i chose my spelling , of the 1980 's if you enjoy vangelis , as i do , you might also want to listen to the compositions of ennio morricone , he is the man who wrote that great music that follows clint eastwood in the sergio leone spaghetti westerns .
1	when i first purchase this album the first time . it was exceptional then and it still is . exceptional and gifted group these ladies rule the early 90 's . some of my favorites free your mind , my lovin , it ai n't over till the fat lady sings , just to name a few . envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time . as far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as supremes , labelle , tlc the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material . they are trendsetters . please go buy this cd . i will buy it again myself . i have the cassette . i need the cd for my collection . i know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a great album as well . go envogue g
0	you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck except for ken nordine he is a god in spoken word , i wished i would have bought two coppies one to poop on and one to cover it up .
1	tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album . even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer , angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound . they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock . the first released single `` the adventure '' is quite enjoyable and even though i have n't checked too deeply into it , i think it 's the theme song for nbc 's studio 60 . besides , how can you go wrong with an album that 's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada
0	holy cow , i was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this . horrible , sophomoric , insipid ... yuk . this is like chinese water torture . drip drip drip on and on . yaaaggghhhh
1	comparing gogol bordello and juf is like comparing apples and oranges . i have seen gogol live more times than i have fingers and toes to count on . when i bought juf i did not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a gogol album . this is a dancehall album . you like it or you do n't , but just remember it is a side project . it does not make any sense to compare it to other gogol albums . listen before you buy
1	this is an awesome ep slayer owns all even when the production is n't that great . kerry king and jeff hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs , tom araya 's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and dave lombardo 's drums are fast as well . this ep is slayer at their prime and even if it 's only four songs it 's well worth the price . below are my views on each song . chemical warfare 100000000000001/10 , yes it is that awesome , this is a legendary slayer song and a fan favorite . if you 're gon na buy this for one song this is it , the lyrics are great and i love the riffs in this track . captor of sin 10/10 , the opening of the song is great . the song is really good too . my second favorite on this ep as well . haunting the chapel 7/10 , i did n't really care for this song much , it 's good but not mind blowing . aggressive perfector 10/10 , slayer 's first song ever , the opening sorta reminds me of metallica 's `` hit the lights '' but the song is very different though . a part of this song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises . the vocals are also a little different from other releases but it 's still awesome . overall this ep was a great follow up to their debut . it also led to what the band would later become , thrash legends . a must have for fans and general metal fans alike . highly reccomended
1	this cd is a classic , a must for all those who loved the movie . i wondered if i would get a crackling type of sound , but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound . this is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a `` sound of music '' event or a singing class !
0	dis gy is da kying of da south ! ! ! give me a f***ing break . when are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums ! ! nothing descent to say at all , just a bunch of mindless [ ... ] . i bet you they do n't even like music , they just want to be a `` celebrity '' and be rich for 3 years ( till their broke ) . if they really did geniunly like music , it would n't sound that sh**y ! ! ! ! get over yourselves ! ! !
1	`` the essential jimmie rodgers '' is highly recommended for any serious country music fan . if anyone is the genuine article , it is jimmie . listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including `` frankie and johnny '' , `` mule skinner blues '' and `` t for texas '' . there are also fine versions of `` waitin ' for a train '' and `` in the jailhouse now '' though some may prefer jerry lee lewis ' version of the former and the webb pierce recording of the latter . the most interesting tracks are less well known . these include `` my old pal '' , `` my old sunny south by the sea '' and one devoted not to a mother but a father ( ! ) - '' daddy and home '' . for this reviewer , the album hit its high point on the final track , a mournful `` tb blues '' , a reference to the disease that took jimmie 's life at 35 . while jimmie 's yodeling style may not be for everyone , this reviewer considers this album a safe bet . keep in mind that jr was elected to both the country and rock and roll hall of fame . further , the `` essential '' series of albums rarely disappoints . these almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts . `` the essential jimmie rodgers '' certainly falls into that category
1	ok ( i imagine there 's still drool over my `` earlier '' review ... and my wife is none too pleased either ... ) truth or dare time ! i bought this cd out of none-too-scientifical curiousity , that , and `` let me blow ya mind '' - and guess what ? i 'm beginnin ' to dig the entire cd . as i mentioned , 99 & amp ; 44/100th % of `` rap music '' fully explains to me what gregg allman meant when he sang , `` it 's not my cross to bear . '' ok , that being said , eve pulls no punches ( although the `` skits '' on the thing about wet myself laughing ) , and she 's not a lady whom 'd i 'd like to cross . but `` i bought the ticket , so i 'm gon na take th ' ride . '' and enjoy myself mightily while doing so..
0	there 's nothing outrageous about the title song - it 's a lame , mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the `` in the zone '' album : imagine `` breathe on me '' , `` touch of my hand '' or `` shadow '' on constant radio play or running on mtv . and no , we 're not apparently going to have that because britney 's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it , like we know ended up in britney 's injury . for nothing . fortunately for this single , it 's got the already legendary `` toxic '' and a marvelous vocal mix version of `` everytime '' - another star for that .
0	ok , booty rap was good in the 90 's , when it was offensive and raunchy like , 2 live crew , disco rick and the dogs , poison clan etc ... ..but this is just wack weak lyrics , corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same ... .and is it just me are these guys as rappers , just horrible there voices all raspy , and annoying and one the guy 's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr ... .. ( what is he on crack or something ) so if you like radio friendly , pretty boy music then the ying yang twins are for you peace ...
0	simply put , jay-z is incredibly overrated . i own a couple of his cds but to be honest , i never really liked him . his beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that i just had to go back and listen to a specific song again . he mostly raps about drugs , money and cars . nothing special , nothing new . i 'm just being real about it , since everyone else is on his d ! ck . i think the reason he 's so respected is because he blew up right after biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time . granted , jay-z does use some good metaphors , but for the most part his lyrics are shallow . best tracks on this album : ca n't knock the hustle brooklyn 's finest w/biggie dead president
1	hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like lady sovereign . she is not only lyrically impressive , but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving , which is basically what she sets out to do . i dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the uk , but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now . and i will patiently await for s.o.v . debut us album . favorite track , though all of it is really good , will have to be `` the battle '' feature other grime scene artists like shystie , zuz rock , and frost p spitting the wildest ( barely understandable lol ) rhymes ive heard . no men and women have battled against each other like this , especially for the listening public . how ever , no one should compare sov to anyone ( missy or m.i.a . ) all emcees , particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such . sov has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date . it 's refreashing to see a new spin on hiphop .
1	i saw midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them . the live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and i 'm now a solid fan . the opening track , roscoe , reminds me a bit of adrian belew , a bit of xtc and a whole lot of midlake themselves . it 's like suddenly realizing how coldplay should sound . the music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel . midlake is definitely their own band , for all the influences i 'm throwing out . they make the sort of music that feels old , like your favorite album you lost long ago . try 'roscoe ' or 'young bride ' for an indication of their style . if you like either of those , you need to buy the album .
1	tosca 's suzuki is not breaking any ground , but by god they have mastered the art . this album is just so professional sounding , very nicely produced . this is how i envision trance to sound like , so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this . funky bassbeats and killer sounds . it 's what they call ethereal ... .i think . it flows so well from track to track , quite the odyessy in under an hour
1	what can you say about mfl that has n't already been said . sublime , perfect , classic . this is still the definitive recording of the show , and no one has ever come close to the original cast . sadly , while the movie is wonderful , had warner bros. used andrew 's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time . and while audrey hepburn gamely gives it her all , andrew 's had clearly made eliza doolittle her own , and she would have been uncomparable on film , and raised the level of the entire movie . well , the rest is history , andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60 's . still , probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical . as george bernard shaw said ( when he finally gave in and saw it during it 's london run ) `` i do n't know where shaw ends and lerner and lowe begins .
1	as a kid , out of the blue was one of the first albums ( actually , 8-track ) i paid for . that decision was made after hearing `` sweet talking woman '' as a single , and after i bought it , the album grew and grew with me . every few weeks , a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable . the first few weeks , it was `` sweet talking woman , '' `` turn to stone , '' and `` mr. blue sky '' ( all pop perfection ) ; the next few weeks , it was `` wild west hero , '' `` across the border , '' and `` jungle . '' after three months , there was n't a corner or edge of the album i did n't know and like . thirty years later , the remastered cd finally comes around and , through the fan club at [ ... ] ( which i heartily recommend because of their labors of love ) i bought this and balance of power ( review coming ) . i have to say i was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of `` pretentious '' has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker , nonetheless ) . a big sigh of relief -- the cd holds the same joys it did before . the moog synthesizer riff by jeff lynne in `` turn to stone '' still pumps the heart , while `` sweet talking woman '' and songs like `` wild west hero '' and `` jungle '' still delight . but i 'm amazed at how things like the `` concerto for a rainy day '' ( four songs including `` mr. blue sky '' -- still the brightest jewel on this album ) still hold together , and songs like `` stepping out '' and `` sweet is the night '' step up to dig their hooks into you even today . while the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up ( `` across the border '' 's horns beg you to crank them up ) , there are a few drop outs ( `` night in the city '' has a couple ) , and of course , my tastes probably do n't translate to everyone . but , my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen , and he has n't returned it to me yet -- i imagine for the next few weeks i 'll still enjoy listening to `` out of the blue '' from downstairs for a few more weeks..
1	it 's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album . this is a timeless work . it never gets old no matter how many times it is played . i 've had this album for 5-6 years and i pull it out every summer . great music for boating or bbq 's on the deck . i promise you will love it . something everyone should have in their collection
0	i would n't know i never got my cd and its been over two month
0	id advise not to buy the album . listening to it is like contacting gonorrhea . trust me ive done both
0	might just be me -- but this is one of those cd 's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one . maybe i 'm too old for the rest -- but wish i had kept the crystal so i could sell it on ebay
0	don caballero have always had members leave , but this is ridiculous . che is not don cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band . ian williams for one is a huge reason for the don caballero sound that i always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete . why che decided on naming this new group under the don caballero name rather than speaking canaries or something else baffles me . more importantly , the music is boring on this album . it 's like the new members only influences were yes and elp sans vocals . in other words , no spontaneity , hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines . avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the battles eps or better yet get the real don cab works like singles breaking up or what burns . there is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this `` new '' don caballero to pieces
0	bad news is that i wasted my time listening to this whinefest . good news is that i bought it used . i give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the cd and she is a cutie . more good news . i re-sold it for my purchase price
0	quality is poor . some songs are not playing . avoid buying @ amazon
1	jock rock is a must for anyone in the fitness business . nothing gets a crowd hopping like a little james brown ! not much for listening to , but a good collection when your looking for just the right song to play for a certain event
0	i have followed bruce hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert dvds . i was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other , but if you have been to hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here . i loved the dvd of some of his performances . there are treasures here , imagine , solo on the piano at an awards show , the star spangled banner at the world series with marsalis , and his performance with bb king.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan
0	this album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste . being a huge alan parsons fan , it pains me to have to say this , but this was almost a total waste of vinyl , energy and money
0	item never came . however in their defense refund was promptly given out . i only wish that i had a chance to receive this one
1	.and so worth the price of admission . 6 cds worth to be exact . coleman 's musical voice is so free and full of life ! it really is beautiful
1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd . i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance , even better than tuckwell 's . the cadenzas are absolutely awesome . i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well . clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy . i 'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician . highly recommended
0	some of the songs here are good , most notably `` never be forgotten '' ... ..beautiful . i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing . herein lies the problem . the song is good , the voice is good . but if she sounds like faith or martina , there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there . add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country ... .there 's really nothing that stands out here . why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there ? that 's the question .
1	i would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years into eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here ! ! i think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is tim roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful ( ive learned some of their songs this way ) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days . and the rest of this band has so much talent , stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting . plus jims drum work , how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers , he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well . this album plain rocks , it should be known as these guys were on gigantour and rocked there too . be cool if them and annihilator went on tour . i have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same !
1	this is a cd that one can listen to countless times . the virtuoso playing and beautiful tone produced by michael aptly display the characteristics of the euphonium . the selections are for college and graduate level players , as well as the occasionally `` gifted '' highschooler . a must hear , and a must buy
0	nothing even close to `` say no more '' i 'm sorry i spent the mone
1	i borrowed this cd from a public library , having liked the track `` crazy life '' on the empire records soundtrack , and i was immediately blown away by how consistently good coil is the whole way through . it is their most mature album , full of gentle emotion and idealism , and puts the listener in a good mood . glen phillip 's voice is unique , confident , and beautiful . i fell in love immediately with `` rings '' and `` dam would break '' . the haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate . `` little buddha '' is so different but so good as well . after i got coil , i bought two of toad 's older albums : fear and dulcinea . both are really good , but something keeps drawing me back to coil . it is achingly beautiful , vibrant , thoughtful , and pleasurable . it is hearing toad at their best .
0	having listened to steven 's previous albums , greetings from michigan and seven swans countless times , i can not help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album . stevens blatantly rips off his own music . i consider michigan to be sufjan 's masterpiece . do yourself a favor and start there
0	the music on this album is performed so exquisitely ; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating , that one is almost tempted to forget what a `` what for ? '' musical this is . donna murphy plays the title character of fosca , a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky . she lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome , virile giorgio . giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful , but vapid clara , a married woman back home . however from the time giorgio comes into fosca 's sphere , she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him . she shows up everywhere he happens to be ; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity . to depict fosca musically , sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career . everything is so lugubrious , dark , portentous , tragic ; punctuated by militaristic strains ( with snare drums ) because the soldiers like to ... umm ... march . in the end , giorgio is worn down enough by fosca 's attentions that he succumbs . he believes he has fallen in love with her , shortly after which she ... dies . as i mentioned earlier , the material is beautifully performed ( marin mazzie and jere shea render the opening `` happiness '' with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality . donna murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting `` loving you . `` ) , but you come away wondering what the point of it all is . if sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease , then he succeeds admirably
0	i played several samples of this cd on my computer while visiting the amazon website and my male cat started meowing along . this cd is good for calming a cat and lining his box . face it , yoko ca n't sing ( unless you have a cat 's ears . )
1	what a great album this is , not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to , but the lyrics are a hoot ! wayne is not afraid to experiment , he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way . the songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you have n't heard in a long time . this album instantly became one of my favorites . i bought two more to give as gifts .
1	this is one of my favorite releases from common . this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers . songs like i used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop . not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks . this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio
1	ethereal , rhythmic , haunting , eclectic . wake : best of dead can dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit . the haunting combination of modern and ancient tunes , combined with phenomenal vocals and instrumentals make this album one to cherish and listen to over and over . each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions .
1	i love this cd ! everything they sing about is so true to life . it 's a great arrangement of songs
0	this cd was supposed to expose a new side of dar willams , it has failed to do this . the lyrics , and songs are repetitive of previous works . i would suggest buying something else
0	about half the songs are great old songs i 'm familiar with , the other half are songs made famous by other artists and most are clangers for elvis that are painful to listen to
1	this is one of my personal favorites . i bought this cd when my daughter was 1 month old . we would listen to it during those `` late night '' feedings to create a peaceful environment . i 'm pretty sure it was a benefit for her . it was definitely a benefit for me
0	i did n't really feel like some of the songs were really love songs . a lot of these songs i had not even heard before .
0	nothing new here . i like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love patton . this cd is dull . suffering from patton overexposure . maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album ( like secret chiefs 3 - book of horizons ) rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
1	i have been into vaisnava spirituality a long time , and they really got it , perfect and professional
1	no diggity was a monster hit in 1996 . if you love this album you will also love michael jackson 's dangerous , which was also co-produced with teddy riley , the lead singer of blackstreet
1	i saw these guys live in the twin cities last week . they opened for keane and the zutons . these guys were definitely the best part of the show . they had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun . to top it off , they sounded great and their songs were well written . give these guys a shot , unless you hate rock 'n ' roll ! !
1	this album is just non-stop funky . i originally got it just because i loved living in america when i first heard it- but i was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the cd just as good . check out turn me loose i 'm dr. feelgood , let 's get personal , and gravity- they 're among the best on the cd
1	i wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film ? my guess is that they did not . the film was enhanced by the james horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle . it is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match . by the way , the bigwigs at universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed ! wonderful music
0	what an outrageous group , how can anyone like this rubbish . maybe an horde of brainless people . how i feel happy in being intelligent , and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres . how said romans , `` it 's just bread and circus to the poors '' . give to people what they deserve , rubbish ! it 's because you mediocre people that buy this , that this kind of people , the members of this group , get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be . it 's the same horde that buy , beyonce , spears , madona , and other outrageous poor music .
1	i do n't like this album as much as their earlier stuff . i have liked each release less than the previous , and this one falls right in line with that trend . the opener `` quality revenge . . . '' is one of their best songs hands down , though . this is a very good cd , but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music
0	bands from the 90s just sucked and nirvana fits in with that . they had a couple of ok songs and kurt cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about . i can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were . i do n't see it . this is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music .
1	i am a lover of `` greatest hits '' compact discs but this one by far is the best one i have purchased recently . this compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that joe walsh made and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock !
0	you know the music industry is in decline when people are giving this single a perfect rating . run for cover
1	people , what a killer release this is . i bought it in '92 when it was released , not knowing what to expect , as i had never heard a single cut from it . i knew schonn was the axeman on this baby , and that was all i needed to know . i popped this cd in the player , and was instantly floored . what great melodic , poweful tunes filled my ears . i 'm not much of a ballad fan , but even those are great . dean castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release , as he adds the power to schonn 's precision . this is how neal would have played with journey , had the suits let him do so . the gioeli brothers , unknown to me at the time , do a masterful job as well . it 's such a shame that great bands make an album or two , and just fade away , ie . lynch mob , badlands and these guys , to name a few . this release is far superior to their second offering , but that one is pretty tasty as well . i suggest paying the coin for this cd , as it 's worth every penny . hardline 2 will run you about twice as much , but imports often do . get 'em both if ya ' can , but this one is the best of the 2. peace .
0	i love patti , and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date . this one is not good at all . this a low point in patti 's career , and god knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk . live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what i can see on tv . i really wanted to like this , but `` ai n't no way '' this song should have been remade by patti and mary who has a pitch issue . if you can not do a song justice , do n't sing it ! ! ! ! ! patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers , but singing high notes do n't `` make '' a song , interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics . patti and mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register . patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one . this cd came and went , period ! i literally gave it away ! ! ! ! !
0	greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , `` tha crossroads '' , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of `` f- tha police '' , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya
0	i 've owned this cd , but did n't keep it for very long because it 's too poppy and slick for my tastes . i guess when about 1981 came around billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70 's style , and on this offering , he kind of wanted a 50 's or 60 's kind of sound . this stuff is just to slick for this hombre . he never made a solid album , after the release of glass houses , in about 1980 . this is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about , but if you 've got some integrity , you 'll probably want to steer clear of this one , and buy anything he recorded in the 70 's
1	this is a wondrful cd and quite a bargin . two discs and the very best of nancy wilson . i liked so much , i bought two and gave one to a friend
1	with freddie backed by herbie , ron carter , and tony williams.this is high-flight crisp and inspiring music.worthy of repeated listenings . listen and enjoy.williams is over the top , very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventiveness.i 've always noticed how carter and williams really spur hancock on as you will notice in this set.hancock , one the the truly great pianist of post-bop era , sounds like he is his having the time of his life.it does n't get much better than this .
1	ca n't say enough about how great this record is . it still stands the test of time by remaining relevant . `` summerland , '' and `` mission man '' are my personal favs , but the whole album deserves raves
1	i first heard dan singing background vocals on the jackson browne album `` late for the sky '' . i was 16 . i went out and bought this album ( which i still have ! ! ) even though i had never heard it . i had the pleasure of seeing dan open for the eagles at the spectrum in support of this album in phila , in 1974 ; i was a junior in high school . they all joined in on `` best of my love '' and it just blew mw away . he had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano . few people had heard of him prior to this album . this is by far his best album . it is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80 's and a true songwriting gem . i can remember singing `` morning sky '' in my friend 's ford on the way to school . you have to listen to it over and over.. `` someone 's been tellin ' you stories '' had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time . the musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting . this was the most raw of dan 's albums , and by ar , the most superior . sadly , dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer ( check out his website ) . let 's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon . this is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970 's rock and roll .
1	metheny 's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles , moods , textures , and sounds . here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective , wide-open-spaces musical journey across america , weaving in jazz , folk , country , rock , mountain music , and everything in between . if you love his work on joni mitchell 's amelia ( performed live on shadows and light ) , you 'll love the sound of this record . the mood is mellow but not dull , quiet but not silent , and the results are spectacular . this is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier , or a short hop to burger king . works either way
1	wow , this album takes me back to the fall of '79 , around the same time as mj was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut `` off the wall '' ! ! both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party essentials when i was a 15 yr old kid spinning the hot joints of the day ! at this time , prince was still a virtual unknown to the mainstream , but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of blacks , gays , and ultra-hip whites who really knew what time it was , this lp served as notice that a `` new thang '' was brewin ' in minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a few short years ! from the opening track , `` i wan na be your lover '' , his first big single ( gold ) to the rockin ' `` why you wan na treat me so bad ? `` , which also was a single and a true fan fave ! -- to `` sexy dancer '' which was sure to bring everybody to the dance floor and into a frenzy ! prince then cools down the mood with `` when we 're dancing close and slow '' , which is just beautiful with its sparse piano and acoustic 12-string guitar -- one of his many underrated slow jams of all time ! then side 2 opened with the pretty `` with you '' and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female bisexuality.. '' bambi '' , which still knocks me for a loop ! i 've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice down through the years.. once in 1980 during his `` dirty mind tour '' and again in 1992 during his `` nude tour '' while i was overseas ! -- awesome ! ! then there 's what i call `` the great triplicate '' ... `` still waiting '' ( another underrated slow classic ! ) , followed by what is to me , the definitive version of `` i feel for you '' ( no disrespect to the great chaka khan ! ) , followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece `` it 's gon na be lonely '' , which still sends me today at 41 the same as it did when i first heard it at 15 ! this album was prince 's first platinum album , proving that he ( at only 22 ) was indeed a hitmaker and one to watch ! this album and the next one , `` dirty mind '' , served as a changing of the gaurd from the older established innovators of that day like stevie wonder , earth , wind fire and parliament / funkadelic , etc . is an essential if your collecting prince classics ! in fact , you ca n't go wrong with this kat between his debut , 1978 's `` for you '' to 1987 's `` sign o ' the times '' ... it just does n't get any better !
1	this is one of the most beautiful , restorative collections of celtic music i have ever heard . haunting , sublime harp , cello , guitar , flute , and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation , prayer , or simply unwinding the mind and emotions . the poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself . highly recommended
1	the slowed down almost spoken version of downpressor man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone . sure i 've got most of the tracks on other tosh collections , but these recordings are excellent variants
1	what 's more to say about what may be the best `` rock '' album ever ( especially if you consider the `` my kingdom '' ep to be the second disc in a two disc set ) ? the most emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever . who else has ever made music like fsol ? the beatles and fripp are the only possible contenders . i 've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful . if i could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all fsol/aa releases , it would be ( as a line in `` the isness '' goes ) `` ... [ a longing for ] inexhaustible ecstasy . '' it 's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror , paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life is n't worth living . it sounds hokey , but just opening up the booklet while listening to `` her face forms in summertime '' and reading the scrawled message `` things are getting f* up round here '' makes my eyes a little watery . my cd developed a 2 second glitch and i just ordered another one -- this is so incredible that nothing less than perfection will do . just a few points of note : if you 're wondering why you spent all that money on your two channel stereo and you have n't heard this album yet , pick it up and turn it up . i 've heard recordings with more bottom end and slam , but none with more depth , nuance and musicality . i 've also found that one of the true tests of a masterpiece is whether it 's possible to really enjoy listening to anything else after its over . play coltrane 's `` ascension , '' beethoven 's string quartet in a minor op . 132 , or bruckner 's ninth and see what i mean . i played dead cities last night and everything to which i tried to listen sounded hopelessly trivial afterwards . in the early 80s , a lot of my friends used to speak of the clash as `` the only band that mattered . '' at the time , i did n't think any band had mattered all that much since '72 . to my now-much-older ears , fsol fits that description more accurately than any band to the last 35 years , and this is probably their best work ( every single one of them is a desert island disc , however ) . one of the very few utterly timeless classics of modern music , and a record that belongs in the collection of anyone with ears .
1	a lot of people seem to snub their noses at let 's talk about love because it was n't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it , but all in all , it 's still a fantastic snapshot for celine 's career in 1997 . celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly ( falling into you was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time ) but it was very worthy . among my faves on the album include `` the reason '' , `` immortality '' with the bee gees ( for a `` celine-less '' version of the song , check out the bee gees ' 2-disc hits collection from 2001 ) , `` love is on the way '' , the very funky `` treat her like a lady '' , `` to love you more '' and the beautiful singalong title track . this album also housed `` my heart will go on '' which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million . while it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes , i 'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful , powerful ballad . with `` falling into you '' and this album , celine was the # 1 female artist for a period , becoming a superstar right as mariah was abandoning ac for r , as alanis was going on hiatus for awhile , and when shania was taking off but had n't yet exploded into major-superstardom . love her or malign her ( it seems fashionable to do the latter ) , she became one of the premier voices in adult contemporary and won over a large audience . i have n't been a fan at all of her last few albums , but if she ever comes back with an album like these two , i 'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
0	the fact that this has had no us release was an immediate warning ... . however as a longtime fan i figured i would check it out . boy is this bad . there are a few decent tracks , however the truly awful `` crazy little thing called love '' , `` this magic moment '' , `` only you '' - among many others - make this unlistenable . miss ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the billie holliday material . she is a producer 's singer : ashford and simpson , chic , holland dozier holland - even hall oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics . this is a mess . diana , your voice still sounds great - stop executive producing your projects
1	this record is a must from the middle of the 50 's . excellent singer , very good musicians and an excellent recording . this record is still amazing and seems to sound very modern due to the quality of the recording and the mastering . i recommend this record to all rock and roll fan
1	neil young 's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs . they are very political so unless you are a completest who likes neil young , if you agree with president bush , this album will be a turn-off . for the politically neutral or those who agree with neil young this is a good album . maybe this is not neil young 's best but it still is a good album
1	i 'm really not sure what the purpose of this disc is , other than as an adam ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection . this is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of `` antics in the forbidden zone '' which detailed adam ant 's career up until the bombastic `` apollo 9 '' album . `` essential '' adds the 1990 single `` room at the top '' from `` manners physique '' album and `` wonderful '' from the 1995 `` wonderful '' album . these two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and i think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums , anyway . and of course `` essential '' ignores the unreleased 1993 album `` persuasion '' which had some really good songs on it . if you want later period adam ant , `` manners '' is really good and `` wonderful '' is , well , less than wonderful , but still a worthwhile adam ant . if you want an introduction to adam ant , the chronologically catalogued `` antics '' is great and a more complete collection !
0	pls tell me tat tis boxset is a joke ! ! ! ! classic rock - reo , romantics ... bangles ? ? ? its more like classic new wave . only thing good would be the price . pls ... who ever the a & amp ; r people are ... pls ... pls ... design something bette
0	ryuichi sakamoto 's credibility is on the precipice with chasm , a turgid unlistenable work of crud . check out coro and only love can conquer hate , both sound like factory machinery at work . dire , dreadful and diabolical . stop being the artiste ryuichi and have a go at entertaining . your fans deserve better
0	i agree with other reviewers . do n't waste your money . i should have listened to the samples . to hear more awful fakes , visit the producer 's web site at drewsfamous.com . listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase
1	`` the dreaming was one of those albums that i found in my parents cd collection when i was young and i have n't outgrown it yet . my parents seemed to hate it and never bought a kate bush cd after it ( though i recently bought her whole collection except `` the whole story '' as it 's just a greatest hits ! ) . this album took me a very long time to get into however . i listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because i thought it was too strange . i took it out then several years later and loved it . i would now say it could be my all time favourite cd and is better than `` hounds of love '' as i see it . the songs all stand on their own and bush 's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through . this is the only album that i will never skip a track because i 'm always in the mood for them all . 1 . `` sat in your lap '' - a great opening track . bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not . the instruments are great as always . 2 . `` there goes a tenner '' - a notable song for the quirky british accent bush puts on . the instruments are very good and remind me of the '80 's ( as it was made then ! ) . that was a good decade for music ! 3 . `` pull out the pin '' - the piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good . the lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade . the song was inspired by a documentary . 4 . `` suspended in gaffa '' - i do n't actually know what gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy . the lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent . 5 . `` leave it open '' - an excellent song that reminds me more of `` hounds of love '' . the instrumentation is excellent as always . 6 . `` the dreaming '' - another brilliant song which is so funny because of bush 's australian accent . the production is good and so is the songwriting . 7 . `` night of the swallow '' - the use of irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song . the singing by bush is superb and the song is flawless ! 8 . `` all the love '' - the song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent . the lyrics are unusual and very well done . the instruments complement bush 's superb voice and never overtake ! 9 . `` houdini '' - the album cover is to do with this song . the song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation . 10 . `` get out of my house '' - a perfect way to end an amazing album . the lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule ( within the song obviously ) . it is something only kate bush could have written ! overall i think it is an amazing album though i can see why people do n't like it . it could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect . kate bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best ( yes , she 's better than tori amos ) . she is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist . reccomended to everyone into alternative , especially tori amos fans ! mark- 10/1
1	although i like this album , there 's nothing that especially stands out about it . it 's typical bright eyes , and if you already love the band you wo n't be disappointed . however , it 's not one of their best albums . it 's not as good as lifted , not as addicting as fevers and mirrors , and not as raw and endearing as letting off the happiness . but yet again , conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a dashboard confessional sort of way
0	when i first saw this album i thought `` heavy d ... .without the boyz ? ! that ca n't be a good thing . '' here 's the problem with this album : heavy d took the `` jiggy '' route . when i heard `` big daddy '' for the first time , i thought it was pretty tight and that it had that heavy d feel to it . so after hearing that , i went and copped the disc . when i got home and read the liner notes , my jaw hit the floor . there was heavy d ... .smoking cigars , iced out , and playing the big willie role ( the popular theme for the `` jiggy '' crowd in '97 ) . at that point , i realized that original mcs were quickly becoming extinct . after years of success with his group , heavy d had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time . that might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent . there are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen . there 's a lot of lazy and predictable production ( we 're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking ) . on `` i 'll do anything '' heavy d and tony dofat completely jacked hall oates for their tune `` i ca n't go for that ( no can do ) '' and it only gets worse throughout the album ( i wo n't even get into how the gap band 's `` yearnin ' for your love '' was abused on `` keep it comin ' '' ) . there are n't enough good songs on this album to make heavy 's change of heart seem very believable . avoid this album y'all . it 's not completely terrible , but it comes dangerously close . there are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack . sadly enough , this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album . i was very disappointed in heavy d and lost a little respect for him after hearing this . i can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $ 3.00 . otherwise , avoid at all costs . standout tracks : big daddy ( my favorite ) and `` you can get it '' feat . the lost boyz soul for rea
1	with engines of creation , joe satriani did what he has always done : make the most of the tools he chooses to use . only this time , he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar . it would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote `` satch boogie , '' `` war '' and `` flying in a blue dream '' went . well , he 's still here , only more than ever he 's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey . i 've never heard robots having sex , but i 'm willing to be `` borg sex '' is n't far off . and although his calmly passing , sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure , that 's kinda how you 'd expect to see `` clouds race across the sky . '' the 'chorus ' to `` devil 's slide '' sounds as sinister as its name suggests and `` attack '' is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as i 've ever heard . to top it off , the album includes `` until we say goodbye , '' one of satch 's best ballads in his entire catalogue . if you 're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off surfing with the alien-style , you 'll find that there 's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found . it 's not a satriani masterpiece , but its a true testament to the man 's enduring creativity
1	cool cd ... have n't heard it in probably 15 to 20 years ... it was fun to hear it again ... .funny though , it 's a bit different than the way i remember it
0	the quality of this cd recording sounds like someone tapped it in their garage and burned it to cd with thier personal pc . very bad recording . it 's too bad because lathleen madigan is very witty and funny .
0	this album is all about sex and infidelity , is this all way usher 's life is about . this album contains to substance worth listening to . this album is a total waste of money . i like 8701 100 percent better
1	this is a really great follow up to allison moorer 's debut album alabama song . the hardest part , her sophomore cd , was released two years after her debut in september 2000 . it builds on the sound presented on her first , and the songs are nothing short of great . my favorite track , though not her own , is her emotional reading of the rolling stones ' `` bring me all your lovin '' . she makes this song into her own . `` no next time '' is another favorite , the lyrics are excellent , a great breakup song . the title track is a nice midtempo country number . `` send down an angel '' is very sad but touching at the same time . other highlights include `` it 's time that i tried '' , `` day you said goodbye '' , `` is it worth it '' and `` feeling that feeling again '' . overall , to me this is her best album . you ca n't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement , and one of her best albums yet
1	well , this is n't at the gates . nightrage reminds me of many old arch enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic . of course , that leads into gus g. substituting chris on concerts being an excellent choice , as they make very similar melodies . some people say this album is heavy , which it is in some parts . but its melodic death , there are no signs of thrash or anything . just great melodies , great headbanging music . add this to your collection , i think its better than sweet vengeance
0	bobby bare is a great singer , one of the most underrated country singers ever . however , most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like `` detroit city '' and `` millers cave ''
1	this cd is absolutely wonderful . i am in australia so strawberry shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the usa , so you can imagine my daughters delight when this cd is being played . the songs are just gorgeous - i just wish they were a little longer . i thoroughly recommend this item to any little ss fans .
1	i love this album . mc lyte is one of the best female rappers.how can someone not like her rap
0	unfortunately ttd went off the deep end on this album . consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album `` symphony or damn '' and the superb follow up `` vibrator '' . if you loved the first album , give this one a miss and get the two i just mentioned . come on ttd hurry up and release a new album
1	for hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s , you ca n't do much better than pat benatar ( and heart ) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years : heart breaker , hit me with your best shot , love is a battlefield , fire and ice , promises in the dark . but no benatar collection is complete without 'treat me right ' , 'you better run ' , and 'i want a lover who wo n't drive me crazy ' ( superior , in my opinion , to the john mellencamp version ) , especially if you prefer benatar 's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads . nevertheless , 'best shots ' is a great place to start and certainly - at $ 10-15 versus $ 50 for the more complete 'all fired up ' -- the best value for the money .
0	dull and uninspiring , listening to this cd i could n't see what distinguished the doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene . if you like the white stripes , franz ferdinand , arctic monkeys , the killers then be grateful that they 've saved rock music from boring dross like this
0	i gave 2 star for this cd not because of the musical quality ... but because the last song `` goodnight my love '' is cut short on this cd . after watching the live performance on cable , i rushed out to buy this cd , labeled by hybrid . only to find out my favorite song `` goodnight my love '' was cut short . on the cd , it ends with the sax doing a solo then fades away ... .which leaves the song dangling and unfinished ! ! ! on the video , this song ends with art singing `` bring you closer to me '' and the music slowly ends beautifully , correctly . there 's a version out which was released by sony in 2003 . i do n't know if this version contains the full song . the hybrid label version is simply ridiculous ! ! ! how can you possibly end such a beautiful song short ! ! leaving it unfinished ... .and well ... .short and listeners wanting more ! ! ! if someone can verify if the sony conatins the full `` goodnight my love '' ... or tell me where i can get this verson , would really appreciate it
0	judas preist 's 1974 debut album . this is simpley weird , i could see why the band hates this album so much ... simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the production sounds like they recorded it in bfi dumpster . when i first got this , i was like `` what the hell ? `` , granted , debut albums are far from perfect , but this was just downright miserable . this sounds like a combination of pink floyd , rush , black sabbath and cream on an acid trip . the song rocka rolla was ok and so was one for the road , but the rest of the material was abismal . sad wings of destiny was such an improvment from this mess ! the coolest thing about this album is the weird scrapping guitar effects tipton makes on one of the songs ! i 'm surprised that this was even issued on a cd , the band does n't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see why ! fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this platter of stange noises provided us with . i know that there are some that like this , but not me ! it is very blues based in some songs , and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers will put you to sleep . any one expecting a rocking metal album from the preist will be let down by this
1	darren aronofsky 's movies are beautiful masterpieces . from `` pi '' to `` the fountain '' , going through `` requiem for a dream '' , they will forever stand as timeless jewels . so they are hard to top in any way , but clint mansell has been able to do it every single time , scoring each of them . for `` the fountain '' , he teamed up once more with kronos quartet and had scottish post-rock band mogwai join in too , to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove , in a very organic way . the central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses . the combination of the talents of mansell , the quartet and mogwai yields a relatively dark , yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
1	this is beck 's coming of age album . `` loser '' was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and `` mellow gold '' landed beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation . his earlier recordings , featured in an album entitled `` one foot in the grave , '' were evidence enough of his musical genius . `` mellow gold '' might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for beck . if that 's the case , then `` mutations '' was his rite of passage , a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album . `` mutations '' has dark , brooding moments with haunting melodies . his lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness . in one song , he sings , `` looking back on some dead world , that looks so new . '' we ca n't always be sure of his references or implications , but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful . his ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful . with `` mutations , '' beck has secured an important place in music history . this is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play . the arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft .
1	considering how much bad music is out there these days , this was nice to come across . covers a wide range of topics and moods , musicianship is pretty good . i 'd recommend it to just about anyone . my tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - rush , dream theater , iron maiden , queensryche . but i like this disc too
1	always loved this group ... .own several of their cd 's and this is by far my favorite . darryl hall 's phrasing of his songs are superb .
1	hounds is an outstanding piece of work . two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly . the first consisting of five individual songs , though all with a very similar feel and texture . the second is a conceptual set of songs called the ninth wave , which has had many meanings read into it . all five tracks from the first piece are excellent . the opening track , running up that hill , is possibly kate 's greatest single of all time ( up there with wuthering heights and babooshka ) , it is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics . it has been reworked by aussie outfit infusion in recent years and become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of john digweed and dj tiesto . it had lost none of it 's appeal or sense of urgency over time . the title track is a beautiful , upbeat song . again it has made a resurgence in the last year , thanks to mod-rock uk band the futureheads . the big sky is my favourite ( you want my reply ? what was the question ? i was looking at the big sky ! ) . the extended mix is great and available on the 1997 emi remastered release of hounds . mother stands for comfort is a little out of place , dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on the dreaming . kates vocals are , in my opinion , sublime on this track . the fantastic song , cloudbusting , nearly deserves a review on it 's own . a masterpiece in modern pop , it tells one of the best stories i 've ever heard in a pop song , and combines it with one of the best video clips i 've ever seen . the ninth wave is beyond review . you need to buy this lp and listen to it over and over again . it will mean different things to different people , and i think that is what makes it so amazing . commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning , i have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life , but each ends happily - the whimsical the morning fog makes sure of it ... else , just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape , read nothing into it and take the ninth wave for a musical ride . that 's my favourite way to listen to it . finally , if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment , say the $ 2000 amplifier you 're about to splurge on , take the remastered lp as your test . the percussion should be clear , the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise . an outstanding lp in every way !
0	i was disappointed by ms. jackson . though it 's not such a big loss b/c i did n't pay much for it . none of the songs `` jumped '' out at me . thank god i did n't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it
0	i bought 4 of their cd 's from amazon after hearing the song `` bad days '' in a batman movie . this cd is the worst of the 4 i bought . not one good song . totally lame . i 'm not even going to stick someone else with it . i 'm just going to throw it out
0	i did n't listen the disk but know the recording label . never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when i was hooked by the low price : very poor immitations . just go for the real things
0	this is what you want ( 1983 ) was a terrible album from john lydon and martin atkins . after an rift between keith levene and john lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks , atkins and lydon ran keith off and he quit the band . instead of keeping him on the finished tracks , atkins and lydon removed levene and pete jones ( the band 's studio bassist ) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them with members from their holiday inn band ( lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a new jersey holiday inn ) . the new tracks and horrible . all of the guitar riffs and rhythm section that were originally recorded for the future album were erased . noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks . the original tracks were far superior ( even in their basic state ) to what was released . to hear them you 'll have to find the commercial zone lp . the failure of this disc and the bickering between atkins and lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king . not recommended
0	i definitely understand why this band is classified as emo . this cd helped me solidify the impression i had that i do n't care for emo . the album is not bad and the band is tight enough for a young band , but the issue i have with emo and with this album in particular , is it 's not really anything . it 's not hardcore , it 's not really melodic ... .it 's sort of stuck in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one . maybe i 'm not the target audience for emo or this band ... .i get that , that 's ok . i ca n't stop thinking thursday seem like they 're trying desperately to sound like fugazi and never really getting there . and that 's the rub of it i guess ... .with bands like thursday and she wants revenge ... they appear to be reaching for the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for someone who knows what the real thing sounds like , they 're a poor imitation . the sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge that the original bands had at the time . i have a friend with a 14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this cd . i think i 'll just be giving it to him and calling it done
1	this album has some of the best country songs in the business . mark sings songs straight from his heart . there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like `` too cold at home '' , `` i 'll think of something else '' , and `` almost goodbye '' to the fast , heels kicking `` bubba shot the jukebox '' , and `` going through the big 'd ' '' . these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart . so if you 're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they 're gone this is the album for you
1	disappear fear 's music is both calming and uplifting at the same time . i especially enjoyed `` laws of nature '' because of it lyrics . ( it has a gay-rights lyrics ) does anyone know which one of the singers is gay ? i would be quite greatful for the answer . if anyone knows , would you mind posting it under the reviews here ? thanx that would be great !
1	at first i did n't think there was enough new material on this soundtrack to make it worthwhile , but the four previously unreleased songs are so completley wonderful , especially `` all i want to know '' and `` heather '' . this is an essential for any stephin merritt fan
1	i 've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite . it 's a cd that i can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy . this would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island . it never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good schon is . unbelievable . if you like this , you 'll like eric johnson 's venus isle album too . two of my all time favorites
1	my first monk album was monk 's dream from columbia . i loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of monk recordings from the blue note years , presitge , and riverside . what monk 's dream offered that the prior work lacked , was production . raw , edgy , spontaneous ... yes all those recordings offered that . but i longed for that sense of confidence , tightness and richness of sound monk 's deream provided . i found that in this set which makes sense since monk 's dream came out of these sessions at columbia . so what if these are reworks of the old stuff ... they sound just as new and gripping `` produced '' as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out . will i throw out my older stuff and just play this ? no chance..there is a time for polish and a time for purity
0	i 'm not exactly sure how to classify this , nor do i think it really deserves the time . how this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me . my only guess is that some tired , pretentious teen on myspace raved over it and voila , the clique was born . now , i really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens . but each time , it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house , started humming some melodies and then recorded them . immature and pretty much unoriginal . and just because an album is labeled `` concept '' does n't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece . if you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy `` the wall '' . unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this , do n't bother with this bloat .
0	i did not like this cd at all . there was not even one song that i liked . however , given the positive result the cd received , it may just have been my personal taste . i also got her new cds , and did not like those eithe
1	please do yourself a favor and buy this cd ! whatever you do , dont listen to it in your car though . no kidding aside , i almost ran my car off the road because i was laughing so hard
0	despite all the rave reviews i 'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord . maybe i 'm paranoid , but the country music industry is so sleazy . and some stars feel entitled to cash in . how else can you explain the john anderson anthology ... horror . ( john , how could you ? ) or the bill anderson oh boy classic [ oh boy here comes a rerecord ) . hey , the cd sounds great . but what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this cd except for one . also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve . could someone please clear this up . and not some rcr bud logan shill either . john conlee is one of my hero 's and this is really worrying me . i ca n't look at this cd with rose colered glasses anymore
0	this cd is awesome from beginning to end . i really enjoy listening to this type of music . this cd is a must have .
0	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums ( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands ) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc . the bunnymen built their reputation on moody , psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain . for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream ' territory , eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach . unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned . if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums ( crocodiles , heaven up here , porcupine and ocean rain ) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers
1	for those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection . bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here . the title sums up the overall feeling of the songs . there 's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had . put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it does n't lift your mood . caution : must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer
1	i have been a barry manilow fan since i was a teenager . i have never been disappointed with any of his work and this cd is no exception ! he is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous ! his voice is as good as ever ! even my 7 year old begs to listen to the cd everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words !
0	i am a huge fan of elvis costello and ran to the shop as soon as i read the great reviews of this album , what a mistake ! ! ! very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version . the cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'clubland ' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful ska sound of 'watching the detectives ' is lost in a jazz arrangement that does n't offer much to the melody . elvis ' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'almost blue ' and most of the songs . it worked well on his 'juliet letters ' album because the brodsky quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the metropole orkest it is just painful . for me , 'hora decubitus ' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble
1	the music contained trout mask replica is some of the most unique , acid-drenched art to ever be pressed . the songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the captain and his band are known for . several strange , unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list , such as bulbs , gingham , trout , and a variety of other surreal , sensously described wildlife . however , if there 's any reason to buy captain beefheart 's trout mask replica , it 's to listen to the album as a whole . i find it difficult to listen to any other way . while i find this to be true , i do have favorites that i go to when introducing friends to the captain , or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience : `` ella guru '' , `` dachaus blues '' , `` dust blows forward '' , `` neone meat dream '' , and `` old fart at play '' stick out
0	well it was an obvious path to musical collapse , she should have stopped at tidal . if i 'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first cd i would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis . the course of the last three cd 's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit . the lyrics on extraordinary machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies . the number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive . her original cd with it 's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing , blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke . what on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy ' by experimenting with music predating the second world war i 'll never know . it 's obvious her angst is no longer producing art , rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph . eat it up people , it 's all about not having to think . it 's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block . judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture .
1	this is mood making , sexy , great music . neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies . this album is great for background music ( we play it in our store ) , party music or just for listing . one of the best guitar players of all time 'sings ' with his instrument . buy it now
0	is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks ( clapton , neil diamond , joni mitchell ) to the occasion , as if it 's some monumental event ? please ! as if the band were anything worthwhile in the first place . sorry , but the whole concept of a bunch of canadians ( well , four of five anyway ) writing this stuff about americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it does n't get much worse than that stupid shot of levon helm wheezing through `` the night they drove old dixie down . '' these guys were just the beneficiaries of rolling stone/elitist rock critic propaganda . ( and to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh ! ) i think martin newell put it best when he called the band `` dreadful bearded ghastliness . ''
1	the band is excellent and this album is just shy of the high quality of the first . however , the encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the major record companies will not stop until they see a negative financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products . do n't support these products
0	i first heard the song on the radio en route to work . i enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake . no doubt 's redo of the 80 's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era . but , of course , it does not compare to the original talk talk version
1	what is the song that is being played when they are handoing out the dance benefit leaflets ? email me at tarahillyard @ aol.co
1	in the early 60 's etta james was to r & amp ; b what patsy cline was to country . she could cross over and yet remain true to her roots , and that 's only one part of a nearly 50 year career ! from the velvety cross over soul of `` at last '' to the hard driving memphis soul of `` tell mama '' , this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today . she ranks right up with aretha franklin as an influential vocalist . i took far too many years to discover her power . if you have n't given her a serious look yet , stop wasting time and begin here
1	live alive is good enough to buy in my standered 's ... ..i really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car , or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better . their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence 's spanning from performences from montreux jazz festival , austin opera house , and the dallas starfest . this recordings are all from 85-through 86 . jimmie vaughan appears on willie the wimp , love struck baby , look at little sister , and change it playing guitar , and string bass . i think the worst song on the entire complination is voodoo chile ( slight return ) which is kind of weird for me to say because i think that was truely the best song stevie ray played live but in this case its not . other than that i really think for what it is it 's a average live performence .
1	i am realtively new to country music . i purchased this because i had the pleasure of hearing willie sing `` you do n't know me '' on cmt one afternoon . i was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up . from this one time `` soft rocker '' i could n't be happier . go willie
1	you definetely got ta own this . after an 11 years break from the music scene , seger 's back full-force . already 400.000 copies sold . more info on bob at [ ...
0	atleast they are trying this time around . still no where near as good as the band was with max . pros : faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without max at the helm . guitar playing is passable . cons : lack of solos . derrick is still lacking as a vocalist . just is n't as good as old sepultura , songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable . bottom line : this album falls short of expectations . the current sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best . if you like old sepultura i suggest you not waste your money on this , but then again you might like it . buyer beware
1	wow ! i love this spykids movie way better than the first one . i think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the cortezes and even more characters , like the giggleses . we met donnagon in the first movie , and he was the reason for the cortez parents to go on the mission . now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the oss . and what about alexandra , the preisidants daughter ? she is the main reason we know about the transmooker device , right ? also grandma and grandpa cortez are joining us in this movie . i think robert rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel , spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams . ... the sequel is awesome ! ! ! !
0	unfortunately , i forked out $ 14 for this cd . upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed . being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green 's previous work . also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist . use this as sunday background music on a rainy day ; but do not expect to get the party started with this album ...
0	i found the vocal delivery on this cd too distracting to allow me to relax . the frequent hesitations and awkward phrases prevent any sense of flow . the narrator 's soft , lilting voice is not by itself hard on the ears , but too often it sounds like she is improvising and reaching for words .
0	after a very disappointing viewing of harry 's only you concert dvd , i got smart and borrowed only you cd from the library . i 'd hoped that concert was just one off . how sad , this cd is no better than that wretched concert . slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish . and what happened to harry 's voice and phrasing ? god , unbearable . when harry met sally , come by me , what happened to you , harry
0	... when you 're gearing up for suicide . this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery and paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head . this is not a good album for the stressed , because it will just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable , after listening to it more and more i started to get more `` into '' it , but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in . it 's a somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb and hurt my head . people say this is great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself . kid a is just ok to me , and has n't been worth all the effort to `` get into '' . this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners . i do n't know , maybe i 'm missing something , but to hear some `` weird '' music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears , try `` passengers '' by u2 . and thom york sings like a muppet on this album . by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit ( including pablo honey -- why are people always busting its chops ) .
0	i did not get my order . you were suppoused to send my money back . i am waiting . thank
0	i ca n't say i liked this cd . jessica simpson was good when she started , but as her popularity has grown , her talents have declined . she commited murder the day she recorded senatra 's song for `` the dukes of hazard '' movie
0	although a few of the tracks seem inspired , it 's mainly mulligan going through the motions with getz , with very little chemistry between them . `` anything goes '' and `` scrapple from the apple '' are nice enough but beyond that it 's weak . mulligan himself did n't speak very highly of the recording session , saying that he enjoyed his other dates with desmond , webster , and hodges , but mentioning that `` granz wanted that session a lot more than i did . '' of course , it would be quite out of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about stan getz and his sparkling personality . save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue of `` meets ben webster '' . or , if you do n't have it already , the seminal pacific recordings with chet baker
0	this is the album when ja officially became a b*tch . his first 2 albums was good , i enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended . i hated this s*it from start to finish . this is a waste of space in the cd case . how can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time ? now i do n't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper , but you should 've at least knew him muthaf***er ! another disembowelment to one of pac 's classics . i stopped listenin ' to ja because he made a big change . not cause of 50 . unlike some turncoat fans .
1	the coltrane soundscapes that this cd is infused flies to the mountain and back again , that 's the truth , but one troubling question for me remains ; no matter how much i enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters ( new old ) - where in the world is alan holdsworth ? if any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the coltrane moniker - it 's holdsworth . for years he 's been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order . including holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do .
0	i thought something must be wrong with my stereo when i first played this cd . brooks and dunn have created some great work , but this is far from it . many of the songs are so dischordant , i would swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something . about two decent songs , the rest are not worth having around . try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent
0	this album is disgusting . no musical talent . this people are the farthest thing from musicians . if you enjoy overproduced music , and a rip off of fellow label mates fob and p ! atd - buy this . it is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record . shaant ca n't sing either . go back to buffalo
1	building a library of oldies to listen to just would n't be complete without this album .
0	i bought this in a haze of holiday optimism , having heard ms. aguilera knock my socks off dueting with tony bennett on a television tribute show . there is no denying that the girl can sing . unfortunately , what she sings here is banal at best , and downright irritating at worst -- lots of gratuitous squealing . it 's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity . i reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age . maybe i just do n't get it . then again , maybe it 's just not there for me to get
0	there are only two artists ' music that i will purchase not having heard one note of the cd . those two artists are barbra streisand and linda eder . `` songs of judy garland '' was a huge disappointment . i was surprised at the cd cover . i do n't know what `` look '' ms. eder was shooting for but she missed the mark . instead of coming off as 10 years younger , she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable . she looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child . ms. eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of `` makeover '' . and the music ... i tried so many times to like it . but the more i listended the more i realized i was listening to `` liza minnelli '' singing her mother 's music . i did not hear linda eder . i 'm begging you ms. eder , go back to what works . i 'm sorry ... this does n't
1	excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic dutch band . each tune was a single sometime between 1965-69 . these guys are not to be confused with a u.s. band from the same era of the same name . cuts that make this cd a true keeper are `` sun 's going down '' , the tripping `` feel like i wanted to cry '' , `` keep on trying '' , the familiar sounding `` touch '' and `` ballad of john b '' . this is yet another band i 've heard at least one or two tracks on the rhino release of 'original artyfacts : nuggets ii ' 4-cd box set.should appeal to fans of pretty things , q65 , early beatles , creation and the action.a must-have
0	a terrible , terrible waste of money . all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head paul godfrey is . face it : no one gives a sh @ t about morcheeba anymore , we 're not interested in who 'inspired ' them , ( poor annette peacock - has anyone told her ? ) . the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age-old question : `` paper or plastic ?
1	this is a great collection of the many `` atom bomb '' songs that are in movies such as `` atomic cafe '' , dr. strangelove , and other films of the genre . i highly recommend this to anyone who collects `` bomb '' memorabilia
0	i 've been down for monica since the beginning ; but now i am finished , i love monica 's voice , but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers ... wtf ! ! ! i want the soulfoul monica from the first cd , `` sideline ho '' are you serious ! ! ! again wtf ! ! could someone please come out with a soulful mature cd , cause this one aint even close .
0	vote this one off the island : 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping , chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by phil collins . it 's all supposed to convey the drama , intrigue and relevance of a tv show ( survivor yell , mud bath , chase race , tally the vote , i can see it , buzzed ) with no drama , intrigue and relevance . a desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television
1	just loved this cd ! ! ! ! you 'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it . if you are 35 years old or older you 'll love it . the memories will come flooding back to you . enjoy it ! !
1	need to say more ? this is one of the most beautiful and honest records western popular music ever seen . she sings beauty , so lovely , as some fairy enchanting gnomes in a huge yet peaceful forest , away from the horrors of humanity . that alien feeling you 'll get it since its first five seconds and it will lasts till the end . druids of the world unite
0	it ' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music . in some cases the music go to the hand with the story , but not in this cd , in which we say the music that it is not for the story . i did n't ejoyed with that c
1	like louis jordan , his less well-known contemporary jump/jive artist , cab calloway fits into an area much beloved by americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre-rock and roll music . though in truth i do love jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of r & amp ; b , calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive/jump music ca n't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart
1	guys , if you 've got feelings for tim , you 're gon na love this one . if you know anything about honest to god country music , this is what you look for . this guy is extremely good and his music fits
0	i wanted to like brotherhood , for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it , usually with a faint whiff of snobbery ( or at least apathy ) . turns out they were right : brotherhood is half an album . most of its nine songs feel unfinished , as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash low-life and did n't care about the end result . brotherhood is a rush job , plain and simple , but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort . `` as it is when it was '' overcomes the album 's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic , and the melody is quite lovely . `` all day long '' , the emotional centerpiece of the album by default , is an intelligent ( if half-hearted ) protest against child abuse . while `` angel dust '' lacks a decent hook , its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest . and the toss-off `` every little counts '' has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order 's work . the most popular song on brotherhood is , of course , `` bizarre love triangle '' . so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely , `` bizarre love triangle '' is truly new order 's masterpiece . the solid beat , slick sequencer work , and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best : catchy , danceable , and downright euphoric . ( imagine how well it would have fit on low-life . ) sadly , the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable . the album 's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes , which has become new order 's signature sound , but the songwriting does n't measure up . buy the album if you 're a trainspotter , but casual new order fans would be better off picking up low-life or 1983 's power , corruption and lies . this one is just a footnote .
0	all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop , its not what ll , rakim , krs-one , kool g rap , ice t , ice cube , nwa , and ( rip ) big and pac , started . we as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album . please do not buy this , this fake rap is got to sto
0	made another bull**** album . honestly i did n't hear this whole album . about 5 years ago i was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd . oh my god for the first time in my life i wished i was deaf . i see the reason why her albums sell though . cause its her looks and nothin else . she 's not ugly at all to me . she just ca n't sing . but she can livin up a crowd . i 'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together , two of the worst people in music , millionaires . go figure
0	the second cd was scratched and hence i can not play it . i would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me . thanks . jeann
1	as with her second album , i love `` thankful '' . kelly clarkson has a beautiful voice and has a lot of talent . i especially like `` whats up lonely '' , `` you thought wrong '' , and `` just missed the train '' . although the whole album is very good .
1	this is a great cd with many good songs as it is one of my favorites and bruce rules
0	these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent . `` totally buble '' is not an album that i wanted to be released . they were songs i recorded for a film called `` totally blonde '' many years ago before i was signed to 143/reprise records . the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer , and i had no control over stopping him . it is important for everyone to know , that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album . '' - michael buble
1	for the past few years it has been very difficult to locate candid jazz cds , the label that critic nat hentoff created over forty years ago . this was a real shame because some classic recordings , including booker little 's `` out front '' and max roach 's `` we insist ! : freedom now suite , '' were on this label . i am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted , but because they were ( slowly ) being remastered . now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist cecil taylor are resurfacing , like `` jumpin ' punkins '' and now `` the world of cecil taylor . '' it is my opinion that taylor 's currently unavailable ( at least domestically ) `` new york city r '' and `` world of c.t . '' are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s . `` world , '' recorded over two successive days in october 1960 , is basically a trio date , with buell neidlinger on bass and dennis charles on drums , and archie shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks , `` air '' and the standard `` lazy afternoon . '' this disc is one of shepp 's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with taylor 's music -- i recall the now out of print mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of `` air . '' but the master takes are truly masterful , and i am delighted that with this cd available once again , we can all return to `` the world of cecil taylor .
0	or in their entire career for that matter . i have tried to like this band , but greg dulli just wo n't shut up . every song is his snide lyrical diatribing , on and on and on . the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting , but on this album in particular , the drummer also wo n't shut up and play a straight beat for once . it 's like three guys in their own worlds , and they mash it together and call what they 've done songs . except for the one decent song they did , the only rock song i can think of that is hard , psychedelic , passionate , powerful , and set to a waltz beat of all things . `` let me lie to you '' is the best song they ever made , because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song 's framework and tempo . instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do , everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses , and it 's less muddled and better orchestrated for it . it 's a shame they did n't do any other songs like this , at least none that i have heard . i tried to like them , i really did . i wanted to find the band that made that one song , and discover a whole treasure chest of dark , passionate , noisy music like that . too bad , no wonder they drifted apart
0	when the preview aired , i was pushing the movie to all my friends , based on the hilarity of the preview . at that time , i skeptically said , `` i hope these do n't turn out to be the only funny parts . '' and that was exactly what happened . the rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes , crass humor that went way over the line and kept running . the pee joke was funny once , but even at that one time they overdid it , then overdid it again , and then again . the harry potter parts were hilarious ! jack sparrow was awesome ! but i wished i had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie . it 's another scary movie ( 1 ) deal , only worse ! i love the newest scary movies , they are funny , but 1 really sucked . it was funny now and then , but a lot of it was stupid . so is epic movie , only worse . do n't waste your money buying it . rent and fast forward .
1	i have just about all of robben 's albums and i believe that this is his best work . the interpretations and musicianship are outstanding . robben 's improvisational playing actually comes across more like composition . his technique is extremely melodic . he is , in my opinion , one the best blues guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a very refreshing twist . check out his prowess on you cut me to the bone , prison of love or my love will never die
0	diana krall 's popularity is not hard to understand , she 's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich , round , and polished . but that 's where the good news ends . the selection of material and the narcoleptic bossa-nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a cd that is nothing less than a love song to darvon , in fact , inside industry sources maintain that the entire cd was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man . the rule with standards is , do n't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair . ms. krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly ; cruel and unusual punishment considering it 's a wonder they 're still standing . the resuscitation of popsicle toes is both the final insult and injury , for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity ; how could she do this to us ? wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who are n't listening to each other , much less the ambient audio wallpaper , there will be a demand for music of this type . the diana kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good . walk , do n't krall . beyond this woozy , soft-focused world there is music that is real , and really matters .
0	this is the 4th worse song to be put out in 2006 . seriously , this is awful . very juvenile and materialistic . this guy and his rented chains need to disapear . what a waste
0	when the airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit ' 'somebody to love ' they were a force to be reckoned with , but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed . now i happen to think that jack cassidy just about saves the band with that bass , but even he ca n't stop the monotony of 'bear melt ' and 'rock me baby ' surely the worst version i 've ever heard and this is all down to jorma kaukonen 's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing . the guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a hot tuna gig . anyone who saw the clip in woodstock will know what i mean..no wonder hendrix 's set was so eagerly awaited ! occasionally the band get it together and balin and slick 's vocals mesh together brilliant , but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate . face it when it comes down to it very few west coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say cream or ten years after . as i said casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear . it 's better than 'thirty seconds ' but then again anything is . if you think that 'happy trails ' and 'live dead ' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set , but i just think its sleep inducing
1	fournier plays exquisitely , imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise . although his interpretation is romantic , the spirit is all bach with no egoism on the part of fournier . there is both serenity and tension in these recordings , and fournier 's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available
0	with the greatest respect to the incredible bob beldon , joe zawinul , and wayne shorter , this box set should contain a warning . the warning is simple : if you already own most of the stuff in this collection , do n't bother . if you 're completely new to weather report , buy it . coming from someone that 's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few `` other '' releases , i was really disappointed with this project ( except for the booklet ) . here are a few things that are puzzling : 1 ) a weather report box set includes three songs ( two composed by zawinul and one by shorter ) that were never released by weather report : a . in a silent way . released by miles davis b. super nova , released by wayne shorter c. experience in e ( excerpt ) , released by cannonball adderly ( i agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors , but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print ) 2 ) an incredible typo stating that alphonse mouzon was the drummer on `` unknown soldier '' 3 ) including a barely improved version of nubian sundance that has been in circulation for many years from `` other '' sources . 4 ) including another `` better than , but not by much '' version of the `` other '' sources for the 1978 rockpalast concert on dvd . 5 ) not remastering any of the original recordings . the tape hiss from the live in tokyo ( i sing the body electric ) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age . 6 ) finally , the cover itself - i have no words , except to admit `` i do n't get it '' . having said all that negative stuff - weather report remains the dominant `` creative machine '' of the jazz rock fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating . if you 're a long time weather report fan - there 's absolutely nothing to get excited about here . the dvd was especially disappointing to me . i have had that concert on vhs tape for many years and now on dvd ( all from `` other '' sources ) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version . zawinul 's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places . ( i played the dvd in 5 different players ; two tv 's and my computer monitor to make sure it was n't my equipment ) . i should have paid attention to the pr person at sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and not from the master tapes . it 's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations . i should probably clarify that while the dvd is in fact clearly better than the `` un-offical '' version , it still looks like a bootleg ! sad ... it is of some significance that this `` review '' is the first time i 've chosen to speak out about something in fusion that was less than flattering . it should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at cbs/sony/bmg and not the musicians/producers . i 'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered mahavishnu orchestra live in cleveland cd that was supposed to be released in 2004 . lastly , let me make it perfectly clear that zawinul , shorter , and beldon are musicians and people i personally hold in the highest esteem with zawinul and shorter being musical divinities as far as i 'm concerned . while my review is an obvious personal venting , and i realize that zawinul and shorter gave this project their stamp of approval , i think that should n't be mistaken for a personal attack . my remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at cbs/sony/bmg . by rick calic jazz rock world
0	lol ! some people cant be serious these days . the lyrics on every track are straight garbage . so he failed bad lyric wise . production wise , some of the beats are pretty good , but a beat doesnt make a song good ! nor does it make horrible lyrics good ! ! so i think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try j-kwon , but the game aint for you . i think this album is garbage
0	you 'll find better works out there , particularly if you 're a miles fan . the emphasis here is on milt jackson and his vibraphone , which gives the album a light , airy feeling . missing is much of miles ' horn and sentiment . you also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music . i would call this a `` pleasant '' album , which in my jazz-world is not a happy thing
0	this lifts your heart to god as you listen . beautifully done
1	this music is undefinable ultimately . oh yes , one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive . one can say many things about it . for me , this , along with `` up the downstairs '' are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day . i 've become a collector of pt 's stuff and like most of it very much indeed . check out some of the side projects of the members in the band -- like blackfield and no-man . they are worth good listenings too . but , you know , this would n't be a bad album to start your pt experience with . no , not at all
0	a friend of mine turned me on to spoon , and at first i listened enthusicatically ... but then i got bored . although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times , they are empty and deviod of any alterations . the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so , but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track . if this is 5 star music today , our culture is severely lacking depth
1	this was the first queen album that i ever had so getting it on cd is great . `` sheer heart attack '' is an overlooked queen gem
1	what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style . he is careful not to over do it , while still demonstrating skill and precision . his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed . the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs , i rarely make it to the end of this cd . still for those who enjoyed `` a go-go '' , this one is quite similar , so make sure to pick it up . this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking , but is a great casual listen . ( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !
1	coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences , blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories : soulful blues , drinking blues and guitar blues . `` b.b king - live at the regal '' is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three . this recording is dear to my heart as i can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother ( god bless ) used to play this on 8-track . she used to love herself some riley `` blues brother '' king . this recording always seemed to be in the player when my cousins and i would come over to visit and rest assured , you will hear it before you left to go home . at that time , being the young naive kid that i was , i remember saying that i hated it and that it was old folks music . all grown up now , in an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on cds , i have a newfound respect for real stuff like this . so instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating , you have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music ... .the blues . in my opinion , `` bb king live at the regal '' is one of mr. king 's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums , this is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like . maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved . the arrangements were put together nicely the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence . bb 's pickin ' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or bb king enthusiast . it sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time . the ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and bb was playing at his best . the only gripe i have about this disc is that it is very short ; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in blues ( especially blues guitar ) . i recommend getting this and bb 's `` live in cook county jail '' . they both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard . good choice if you get this one .
1	the rosary is very well produced . a powerful tool to crush the devils head
1	these guys are the best group out right now . every single rapper is amazing even bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics . this album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including sh*t can happen , pistol pistol , ai n't nuttin ' but music , american psycho , fight music revelation . my favorite rappers are swifty eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now ( besides em , only proof ( r.i.p . ) bizarre do ... which are my least favorite rappers in the group ) every song is great even the skits are enjoyable . if you do n't have this yet , you are missing out on one of the best cds ever
1	i 'm biased , because i loved the movie and adore the book . gregson-williams does an outstanding job here ( before this , i was most familiar with his score work on metal gear solid videogames ) . the music is extremely touching and magical . the `` evacuating london score '' ( from the scene in the train station ) tugs at the heartstrings . and the `` battle score '' brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie 's climax . one song that 's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek . other than that absence ( probably due to copyright restrictions ) , this is an excellent cd . as for the `` bonus '' dvd - i probably would n't purchase it if i had a second chance . it 's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art . there is only one trailer , and it is not the very first one released , which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin ' with its intro of the wardrobe . there are also behind-the-scenes interviews i have n't watched yet , but i wonder if they 'll appear again when the movie dvd is released .
0	bought this cd based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums i like , and man , what a mistake . this cd borders on unlistenable , with no discernable melody/talent to be found . i 'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover ... i consider `` blueberry boat '' to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible
0	he just needs to retire . screw this non-gangsta . no real g sings , they just rap , god
0	i bought this album because i loved the title song . it 's such a great song , how bad can the rest of the album be , right ? well , the rest of the songs are just filler and are n't worth the money i paid for this . it 's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe . kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene . he 's got ta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town . i 'll get down off my soapbox now . but country music really needs to get back to it 's roots and stop this pop nonsense . what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things .
0	i purchased this album because i am a fan of the last poets . upon listening to the samples provided by amazon.com , i thought i was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the last poets : some great politically charged poetry , perhaps accompanied by some funky beats . however , when i listened to the whole cd , i was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like `` get out of the ghetto blues . '' if more of the tracks had the sound of the title track , this would be a five-star album , in my opinion . true , scott-heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album , but not in the form i had hoped for . i would take the last poets ' album `` this is madness '' over this particular scott-heron album
0	this record kind of sucks , but that 's okay , because it does n't suck in the way where you think `` oh hell we 'll never get a good album out of this guy again '' ( like , for instance , rod stewart 's latest garbage ) , because , i think , it 's not really lou 's fault . the problem is lou 's trying to draw his material from somewhere else , in this case a mediocre poet . we 've always been willing to overlook his ( poe 's ) considerable lack of talent ( example : `` in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore '' ) because he 's so damn charismatic . morbidly charismatic , but charismatic nonetheless . the danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art ( which i guess makes him a lot like the rolling stones ) . lou , who 's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink , has now chosen an artist who is basically bernie taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit , and from someone who , velvet genius notwithstanding , produced revolutionary and stunning works like transformer , metal machine music , and berlin , this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy
0	this is the # 1 worse song of 2006 ( # 2 is `` sexyback '' by justin timberfake ) . for real . his voice is awful and i do n't know who is worse : james blunt , macy gray , or shakira . imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage . it would be pure he11
1	earlier , i had an lp called `` best of the band '' that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes . this is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length . there are a lot of `` best of/greatest hits '' type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70 's or early 80 's that had a limited number of songs and length . this is a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money . the music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals . it gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime . as an aside , 3 of the band members ( helm , danko , and hudson ) also put out some good music in the 1990 's
0	while i doubt i 'll ever get used to the edited ( single ? ) version of 'nights in white satin ' presented here , i have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band . that said , the moody blues ( or more likely , their record label ) have n't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on cd , either . while 'gold ' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from the moody blues , it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well . if i had to guess , i 'd say much of the music contained on 'gold ' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections , and on the band 's original cd albums . there are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc . for instance , the music track of 'nights ' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier cd versions of this song ; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song ( my guess ) , but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples ( albeit , in the full album form including the late lament and the full orchestral intro ) are hard for this listener to stomach . i can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing . whatever the reason , the original source material used for this cd could 've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work . while i suspect that would 've raised the asking price of 'gold ' , i also would contend that great music deserves such caring treatment . as it is , too much of 'gold ' as issued is indeed quite tarnished , which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of au would 've been impossible to do . but evidently in realm of the corporate music world , when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled cds it 's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up
0	this album had two good songs at the most . ralph was good with new edition . it 's apparently obvious that he ca n't stand alone . bobby should have been the lead for new edition . then we may never have seen this terrible album . ralph is n't that good of a singer . this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does n't mean you are the best . ralph is miles behind bobby
0	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = elefant 's lyrics . i personally like interpol and the strokes ; i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
0	buyer beware . these new journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases . they are not remastered in 2006 . rhino should be ashamed of itself for this ( it 's been 10 years - i would have gladly paid for a remastered version , but not for new packaging )
0	jimi hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio , and he thrived in that format . he inspired other groups to attempt it , with varying degrees of success . but the experience was a unit , able to soar on stage in extended live versions of hendrix 's compositions . had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself ( that curses so many otherwise excellent bands ) , the experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart . the album band of gypsys was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the experience . at the time , loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less cutting edge . it 's true that jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him , but there 's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance . buddy miles became a kind of intrusion into the world jimi had fashioned in his previous work . on a hendrix album , songs sung by buddy miles did n't move the bar ; they did not elucidate jimi 's universe . buddy 's drum work was simply not in the style of mitch mitchell , and that was a large step down from the experience 's innovative grooves in songs like `` fire , '' for example . listen to `` fire , '' and then listen to any cut on `` band of gypsys . '' listen to hendrix 's wild half-sung , half-wailed vocals on the previous albums , and then listen to buddy miles sing `` changes . '' you ca n't reconcile the two styles , and that would not be quite so bad if it were n't for the obvious fact that band of gypsys , under buddy miles ' unfortunate influence , were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by jimi 's previous work in tracks like `` are you experienced ? '' and `` third stone from the sun . '' jimi 's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf . band of gypsys turned jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band , which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman buddy miles . that 's not what people bought a hendrix album for . it just did n't work very well as a release from what people still considered the hendrix experience . jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow , and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point . no doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove , but the cohesion of the experience , the clear creative identity of the hendrix experience was not there . you can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed noel redding and mitch mitchell , and that may be true . but whatever the line-up , people were not entirely ready for jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players .
1	without a doubt , the highlight is the dvd of the 1975 show in london . `` born to run , '' the album , had put him on the cover of `` time '' and `` newsweek '' the same week in october , 1975 , one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story . the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash : `` nobody can be that good . '' so here we see his first show ever in the uk , playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics , people thinking , `` hey , 'rock and roll future , ' this is the land of the beatles , the rolling stones , the who - who do you think you 're kidding . no unknown kid from america deserves 'time ' and 'newsweek . ' '' the show begins in almost total darkness , a piano softly plays , then harmonica , and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings `` thunder road , '' accompanied by only piano . an unknown song at the time , `` thunder road '' has become a springsteen classic . imho , especially given the expectations , it is a perfect understated opening . the dvd has the entire show , including everything from the hard rock of `` she 's the one , '' and `` born to run , '' the song , to a much slowed down version of `` for you , '' an underated sleeper on his first album , `` greeting from asbuty park , nj . '' bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear , this version of `` for you '' is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god . any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears , no taste , or was xenophobic . the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real , as a songwriter and performer , and that `` born to run , '' especially , is an extraodinary album . there are only eight songs , but none are fill . repeated listenings of the four corners of the album ( before cds ) `` backstreets , '' `` jungleland , '' thunder road , '' and the title song are so good they become ... well , addictive , works of genius , and lead to still more listening . `` tenth avenue freeze out , '' `` night , '' and especially `` she 's the one '' could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album . even the whispered `` meeting across the river , '' fits and helps the album become a coherent whole . the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts . as a footnote i 'll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as `` born to run '' and that is his next one , `` darkness on the edge of town . '' everything he has released is good ; a good bit of it is great , but i do n't think anything else matches `` born to run '' or `` darkness . '' i do n't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released . the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock 's greatest performer . by 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world , selling out multiple nights at football stadiums . the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears . perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement . the dvd , `` the making of 'born to run , ' '' is interesting , but will probably appeal mainly to fans . however the dvd of the 1975 london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce , or rock roll , or showmanship , or history . its a treat
1	few `` metal '' bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused `` power ballad '' . tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed , and shut it off when unnecessary . this debut from the sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead , yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome . the album starts off with a great rythym section groove , then growing and ripping into ez cum ez go , a song that takes the listener up and down more often than a valencia theme park ride . comin ' atcha live seems destined to be the song that the band opens their live shows with , falling back into the rif-filled melodic offering of `` getting better '' . then the pace swells again into `` too late for love '' , and thunders into the anthemic fist-pumping `` rock me to the top '' . `` we 're no good together '' may start like the dreaded power ballad as jeff keith laments about the proverbial one that got away , but screams to a conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast ( pun intended ) guitar solos . `` modern day cowboy '' is the token political anti-war statement , slows down a bit for `` changes '' but up next is one of their fans ' favorites . `` little suzi '' begins with a tasty acoustic piece , and progresses into the culmination of the bands ' melodic songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs ( pun intended ) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame . i 'm a little surprised at the way the album closes , though . after the huge highs through the middle of the album , the final three cuts are somewhat disappointing to me . do n't get me wrong , they 're still decent , but i would have liked these three shifted to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end - `` little suzi '' would have been a great way to end the album . overall , even though the band did a lot of great stuff ( including their biggest commercial success ) in later albums , this remains their best body of work
0	john mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low , but he is still a professionaly trained monkey , i mean musician . mayer along with `` artists '' like gavin degraw , teddy geiger , etc. , are todays n'sync and backstreet boys , nothing more .
1	for any seasoned fans of the waifs ( or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot ) , 'shelter me ' will be no departure -- and no disapointment -- from what you 've heard before . the album weighs heavily on the waifs accoustical appeal . the majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it 's just the girls , their guitars , and the usual , typically wonderful songwriting that comes from josh cunningham , the third member of this stellar folk ensemble . the title track 'shelter me ' is a gorgeous , magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling , `` take me now where shelter be/ before there 's nothing left of me . '' vikki 's final track 'spotlight ' is a pure gem , emotional and raw but utterly beautiful . 'attention ' finishes the album well with that familliar waify energy and pulse , almost blue grass , almost country , but totally wonderful .
1	solas ' previous cd `` words that remain '' is a classic in irish traditional music and the loss of karan casey certainly affects their sound on this album . however , instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and deirdre scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles . i do n't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music . the instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high . there are some lovely songs - i like `` bonnie mae '' and `` miner 's life '' in particular and `` i will remember you '' is an original gem . i am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of `` traditional '' music on the cd and about the use of `` rock '' instruments . based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp , uillean pipes , wooden flute and fiddle ( tin whistle ( flageolet ) , guitar , mandolin , bouzouki , accordion and banjo being modern , foreign invaders ) and what a pity ! what defines traditional - is it pre-planxty ? can no more traditional songs be written ? seamus egan and co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music ( rhythm and melody ) and have enriched it with a new chapter . in general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective . i would also highly revcommend liz carroll 's `` lost in the loop '' although if you 're a purist it has the solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of liz 's `` brand new '' traditional tunes ( brilliant )
0	kate moss ? that gawddamn rollerskate song ? oh , no . the spoken tracks are equally repelling . there is really no atmosphere to this album
1	superior to the first steppenwolf album in many ways , and including a song that tops even 'born to be wild ' itself , 'magic carpet ride ' , is as essential as the group 's first album , even to the casual rock fan . it opens with 'faster than the speed of life ' , a perfect blend of steppenwolfish hard rock airplanesque psychedelic rock ( like 'she has funny cars ' ) . 'tighten up your wing ' is an upbeat , bluesy track , that bounces well along , before being replaced with 'none of your doing ' , a steppenwolf-classic , that shifts gear between verse chorus . 'spiritual fantasy ' is one of the strangest creations on the album , strangely touching , though appaling at first . but given a second chance , it comes across as one of the best tracks on the album . the marihuana-anthem 'do n't step on the grass , sam ' is pure heavy steppenwolf , a timeless classic , that crunches slowly , but steadily along . '28 ' is a great rock song with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody . a neat little rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track . 'magic carpet ride ' is simply steppenwolf 's best song ever , a fantastic blend of rhytm , melody vision , that is worth the price of all steppenwolf 's classic albums on its own . it was also the only of their singles to almost replicate 'born to be wild 's us # 2 placing , when it shot to # 3 on the us chart . 'disappointment number ' is almost that , but then not again . it is an odd ode to/parody of old blues , complete with bird sounds in the background , as if it 's an old blues singer sitting out in the open . 'lost and found by trial and error ' has a great tune , and rocks away well , as does 'hodge , podge , strained through a leslie ' and 'resurrection ' . both employ the classic steppenwolf sound in a great rocking way , to become , if not classics , then at least steppenwolf-standards . the album closes with 'reflections ' a weird song , that seems like somebody trying to be visionary , before you realize that that is just what he is . just in a very peculiar way . the album has some , if not weak , then not too powerful spots , but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up to the first steppenwolf album , with a great blend of the band 's traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them perfectly . even the least interesting tracks rock nicely , no-one should have anything to complain about here..
1	this book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom , and the natural things all animals do . it teaches them to be comfortable with - without shame - the move from being a diaper-clad baby to a big kid . the drawings are charming ! i bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction
1	sony / legacy does a fine job with this compilation , but it could 've been much better imo ! ! here 's what i did to improve this cd ( fans can do the same thing ! ! there 's enough cd space available ! ) ... include the full length vesrion of 'encore ' ( the single mix has to go ! ) , and add the following rare bonus tracks ... 16 . 'at last you 're mine ' ( fr . 'heavenly bodies ' sdtk 1985 ) 17 . 'steppin ' into the night ' ( fr . 'armed dangerous ' sdtk 1986 ) . the single version of 'got to be real ' is fine because it includes cheryl 's trademark `` soo-hoo , soo-hoo '' vocal break that 's absent on the longer album version . all in all , i 'd recommend this cd to anybody that wants the best cheryl lynn compilation , but serious fans will want more ! ! 'the best of cheryl lynn , vol.2 ' has been long overdue for years , but you may have to make that one yourself until rhino does the job ! peace , sd ( of 'chaka 's world ' )
1	even though gary allen is a country singer , he rocks as an artist ! he has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice . this man 's voice is so smooth , he could melt butter along with any woman 's heart . guys will like him too , but he 's a crooner , his ballads touch women ( sigh ! ) and make men want to emulate him . i enjoyed every song on this cd , but my personal favorites are : tough little boys , and songs about rain , both beg to be sang along with
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 . each time he offers a new recording , i try to purchase it as quickly as possible . robben can rock and play slow blues . every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again . i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford , do n't miss chris cain . this man is also a guitar genius
0	their new stuff is even worse . but this is still sexist , boring , annoying music at its worst . there are much better artists out there , so why listen to these two untalented rappers
0	i bought this cd for `` hole in the earth '' , a very dynamic , driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker , and mostly got what i expected - more of the same along a continuum , sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction , as i expected . and then i came upon `` pink cellphone '' , a rotten apple if there ever was one . this vile little stinker is as if one of the band 's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze , defecated on the mixing board , and then described her experience , in no uncertain terms , into an answering machine . if there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist 's complete cds to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web , this is it . congratulations , guys , you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head , but convinced me , and i 'd wager , many listeners , that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their `` b '' sides . to say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates . someone should wash the deftones ' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars .
1	this album has morse code on it , what more can you say ... ... well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres , complete with t6 buzz and slow drift . and the music is pretty good too .
0	tihs album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day . i like all his other albums better i do n't know why he decided to release this crap.but the only song i really like is hip hip qurtables
0	bits of beatles , zappa , queen , ( herman 's hermits ? ) , may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator . elfman 's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal musical pieces , they have fairly banal , repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music . has the creepy competence of a dave grusin album . if you like that you 'll be ok here
0	am i the only ones who actually liked nelly 's first album , i thought it had charm , style , grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance , you thought it mean something , but this is just a lame gimmick from the start , i mean there are some moments and some good songs ( including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer ) , but the rest are just horrible , there is nothing else about this album that i can engage with nor cared about and who cares ? country grammer was funny and good , this one 's an utter disaster . one of the worst albums of the decade .
1	the music intelligentia probably wo n't like james morrison 's new album because almost everybody else will love it . bourgeois = uncool . however , if you just listen and feel this album , even if you have snobbish tendencies , it will move you . enjoy this amazing new album . i am
0	this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g-funk heyday . warren g. did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before . the skits are ridiculous , the music is halfass , and the lyrics are amateur . there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album . this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w.c. and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's `` it takes a thief '' . one star for the hit single `` summertime in the l.b.c . `` .

1	i 've gotten a copy of this cd for every friend i have so they can know what i 'm talking about when i crack a random joke . my mom even loves it and she would not be considered the 'target market ' . for mitch check out his first cd , if you can find it in stores , if not , go online
1	i was at the brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they ca n't be better . standout tracks include the two by martha wainwright , the two by teddy thompson , perla batalla 's `` bird on a wire '' , rufus ' `` chelsea hotel '' and ( from the sydney concert ) antony 's `` if it be your will '' . two major disappointments though ; the inclusion of u2 as backing band for leonard cohen 's own version of `` tower of song '' seems done for purely commercial reasons and does n't work , and the nonsensical ommission of linda thompson 's sublime take on `` alexandra leaving '' . here 's hoping it 's included on the dvd release

1	i 'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about ( sounds like someone with an axe to grind ) but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship . the music is inspired , the melodies transcending , and the emotion - deep and meaningful . as far as `` copying yanni '' goes , well - i do n't agree , in fact , yanni is far more generic and less inspired . the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor , are they yanni 's creation . i write this review to commend mr farish on his work , and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't resist his own urge to see his `` critique '' in print . ryans music is distinctly his own , no question - and any similarities are tonal , and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of . as far as i 'm concerned , you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize - and well , make themselves feel a little better . personally , i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy . all the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! i do .
0	i remember listening to this years ago , and i thought i would add this to my cd library , now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it , , very sqeaky , dull , slow paced stuff , bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
1	i got secret story as a christmas present last year . i had asked for imaginary day , because the only tune i had heard from pat metheny was `` the roots of coincidence , '' and i was itching for more . i still could n't wait to hear what was on secret story , but i was hoping it would be in the same vain as the roots of coincidence . what i ended up hearing was an incredible cd with a vast scope , filled with emotions that change from tune to tune . searching for tunes to sound like roots was not successful ; instead , i joyfully found a complete and very unique set . i agree with others that for maximum experience you should have enough time to listen to it in one sitting , straight through . the musical roller coaster is the most extravagant when done this way . i found myself trying to pick out favorite tunes , but i ended up picking ones for only a particular `` mood '' ( such as an upbeat or sedative one ) . i could just as easily pick a few different tunes for another mood . that 's why it 's fun to listen to it straight through : no other album of mine gives me so much in so little time . of course , metheny has apparently mastered the flow of the tracks , too : one leads right into the next , creating , oh , maybe a `` story ? '' i do n't know the story , but it 's a lot of fun to make up a different story each time you listen to it . i guess the tune that i most like to play , no matter what mood i 'm in , is `` cathedral in a suitcase , '' with it 's mesmerizing 3-against-2 beat and a well-crafted three-chord progression that it revolves around . tunes range from the euphoric ( cathedral , finding and believing , facing west , the truth will always be ) , to the sweet ( the longest summer , sunlight , always and forever ) , to the smooth ( rain river , antonia , as a flower blossoms , see the world ) , to the calm and reflective ( above the treetops , tell her you saw me , not to be forgotten ) . of course , this is all the tunes , and it makes for such a satisfying experience . since this is my first metheny cd , i am definitely going to pursue more . metheny seems worth my time and money
1	just wonderful , wonderful ! even if you have n't seen the movie buy the music ... so lovely and refreshing ... of course , there is no one like van morrison ( always and forever a 5-star ) , he tops the all-time charts for me ... kevin kline is so smooth with la mer ... and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting ... you just ca n't miss with this one
1	`` animal farm '' is a personal favorite of mine . and i dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion , the most underrated song ever written ( yes i know , its a bold statement ) . theres something about davies ' voice in `` animal farm '' that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part : 'while i lay my head upon my pillow little girl , come play beneath my window though she 's far from home she is free from harm and she need not fear she is by my side and the sky is wide so let the sun shine bright ' the build up to davies screaming `` she is by my side '' is really breathtaking . the title track and `` starstruck '' are just as excellent . this album is a real treat and should be in everybody 's collection
1	the first time i read this book was at the age of 13 . my mother had an old , worn , 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf , and one day i just decided to give it a try . i think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me . i remember struggling with the language at the beginning , and having to look up several words in the dictionary . after 100 pages , i had finally `` learnt the language , '' and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue . i enjoyed it , and over the years i returned to it again and again . now , at the age of 35 , i practically have numerous passages memorized , and reading the book is no longer a culture shock . every word of this novel is an old friend , and i would n't remove a single one from the text . this is the book i turn to when i 'm in the mood to read , but not in the mood to read something new . every time i read it , i am struck by its relevance . i do n't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society ( although i think we still see a little of that to this day ) . i refer to the characters . their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless . i can identify with every single character in this novel . when lizzy and mr. darcy fell in love , their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time . that is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films . you can not possibly do wrong by reading this novel
1	this is not only brian eno 's best album , but one of the finest albums ever made -- a work of simple beauty , complex intelligence , and imagination..
1	i remember listning to this album over and over again when i was young . to this day i still ca n't get these awesome songs out of my head ! a must get album for you old school folks or anyone that enjoys great music
0	i have both volume i ii so could n't resist buying volume iii . the music was good , ca n't complain about good pickin ' like that but i did notice that the original intent of the album is being re-thought it appears and it takes away from the entire concept for me . will the circle be unbroken ii was originally made to showcase the talents of the decendents and family of the original players/singers on vol i . it was keeping the `` circle '' alive by bringing in fresh new sounds from new generations of musicians of those who played on volume i. tom petty ? ? where does that come in to play ? how does he fit in the circle ? i was amazed that `` this ones son '' and `` that ones son '' were invited to play on this album , but the huskey 's ( whom i loved for their bass playing ) were totally ignored this go 'round . junior huskey played vol . i , roy huskey jr. ( junior 's son ) played vol . ii . why was n't roy 's son john invited to play on vol iii ? is n't that the purpose of this album ? to keep the circle alive ? roy huskey jr has 2 sons , one of which is a musician ( not sure about the other one ) . where was he ? given the tradition of the albums , i do n't see how tom petty could possibly be invited over a 3rd generation family musician . i was very disappointed to find the huskey 's not on this album . they were the backbone of the first two . not just the huskey 's , but there are other noticeable 's left out of this album as well . it 's just a shame that such a great concept has gone down the tubes . it seems to me , that in favor of the elite , the circle has most definitely been broken which really takes away from what the album was intended for
0	i used to like rob zombie , up until hellbilly delux . everything after that is garbage . this album is no exception . every song sounds the same and is very predictable . the lyrics are nonsensical , educated horses ? he says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this cd , i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd 's together to scrap in some extra money . he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented . i do n't recommend this cd to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his cd's/merchandise regardless . 1 star , i went through this cd in less than 10 minutes , very disappointed , and will never put it back into a cd-player again
1	the only problem with betty buckley is that she is n't nearly as well known as she deserves to be , considering the length and quality of her career . this album of somgs from her 1996 aids benefit concert at carnegie hall is simply flawless . naturally , it 's heavy on music from broadway , the london stage , and film scores , but she sings one mary chapin carpenter song , `` come on , come on , '' that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it . if you 're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style , listen to betty buckley for fifteen minutes and you 'll feel as if you 'd never heard real singing before . she is an original , and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade
0	i was literally horrified when i first put this album in my cd player . this cd is absolutly terrible , every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play . furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent , they 'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing . do not , i repeat , do not purchase this album . i was expecting some cool , fun , funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious . the only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster
0	i 'm mean , i know these guys do n't have a shred of originality.. afterall , that make some of the same crappy beats you can put together on piano 's and they just got to mess up classic songs also . he 's about as good of a musician as he is an actor . this country is just too unoriginal these days
1	`` horizon '' was a turning point in the recording career of the carpenters -- a more sophisticated sound more suited to karen 's rich and warm voice . but the album was rather short , and some of the songs just were n't up to the standards expected by their fans , which was reflected in the sales of the album , which was their slowest selling album up to that point . the opening `` aurora '' and the closing `` eventide '' ( the same melody with different lyrics ) nicely bookend the album , and aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average carpenters album . `` only yesterday '' follows ; this beautiful and uptempo song begins as a dolorous , downbeat ballad before segueing into the cheerful refrain . the cover of `` desperado '' is well done , but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks before and after it . `` please mr. postman '' is infectuously happy fluff ; it has absolutely no depth , but is irresistable while it 's playing and will have you singing along with karen . the big-band era `` i can dream , ca n't i ? '' reveals the new depths of karen 's voice , and the small jazz combo ensures that she is the focus of the listener . the third and final single from this album , `` solitaire '' begins the second half of the album on a ( metaphorical ) high note . the remaining full tracks ( `` happy '' , '' i 'm caught between goodbye and i love you '' , and `` love me for what i am '' ) are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit from karen 's reading and richard 's arrangements
1	i can honestly say that when i first heard scarling 's `` so long , scarecrow '' , i was less than impressed . i 've been into scarling for a few years now , and when i heard their first record , '' sweet heart dealer '' , i instantly fell in love . i somewhat held it above everything else , i was so impressed by it . so when i heard the progression from shd to sls , i was a little bit let down . but after three solid listens , from first to last , i was totally amazed by this record . it was like something clicked and i was able to see the beauty each track held . i seriously listen to this cd almost everyday . although i prefer some tracks to others [ ( northbound on ) cauhenga ! ] , i really ca n't think of one track that i just do n't like . it now takes place in my favorites over shd . i feel that this record can really appeal to anyone ; it 's very versatile . and , as always , jessicka 's beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the music wonderfully . if you 're indecisive about purchasing this record , i say bite the bullet , give it a few solid listens , and promptly be blown away
1	this is the best `` cover '' album i have ever seen or heard in my life . a wonderful selection of material and a reflection of agnetha 's great judgment of how best to pay tribute to her favorite , and most influential , musical artists . her voice is absolutely flawless and just as powerful ( and pure ) as her days of old with abba . it would have sold well with the right kind of promotion such as touring which i read she had planned at one point . unfortunately , she had to cancel any such ideas . i would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in my life , whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from this album or anything previous . we can only hope the day will come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and anxious fans . it 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility . it is neither an impossibility that agnetha record subsequent material in the not too distant future as this album without a doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to share with the world
0	people buy fast food , they know its bad for them . people pay the geek squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work . people also pay 10 bucks for words techno beats called `` pop music '' . amazing , if you had this much money : go get a gym membership . pay off your cars . donate it to children 's hospital . why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion
1	when i first heard this album i was a bit shocked . myself and my fellow tmbg fans derided it as a `` teen angst album , '' moaned and whined that john john had betrayed us by adding a band , and generally refused to give it a chance . a few years later , listening to my entire collection of tmbg in chonological order ( a sanity-restoration ritual ) , i realized that this album is awesome ! there are only 2 stupid songs , window and dirtbike . hey , for tmbg , that 's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis . aside from that , there are more rockin ' , thought-provoking tunes here than you 'll find almost anywhere . this album establishes beyond a doubt that tmbg are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history . i 'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of tmbg fans who have and will . i will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however : `` i should be allowed to think '' - tmbg does justice to beat poetry , and beyond ! `` why must i be sad ? '' - funny and pissy , great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck . the lyrics are genius , subtly quoting the best of alice cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek . `` a self called nowhere '' - righteous , angry , and breathtaking . angsty punk bands of the world , take note : you will never be this hardcore . `` the end of the tour '' - i have written in my last wishes that i want this one played at my funeral . one of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written . if your idea of tmbg is songs like `` istanbul '' and `` particle man , '' get over it ! and give this album a chance !
1	this is my favorite bob dylan album . the album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever , like a rolling stone and my favorite desolation row . sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs . the album is filled with incredible lyrics , wonderful music , and a mean harmonica . if you want to know why bob dylan is a legend buy this album
1	good old silly , irreverent slade never really caught on in the us , but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then , and this is the best collection of their works , including all of the slade 's hit singles from the early '70s , from 1971 's `` get down and get with it '' to 1975 's `` thanks for the memory ( wham bam thank you mam ) '' . slade scored a whopping 11 top five hits between 1971 and 1974 ( five of which topped the charts ) , and they 're all here . so are their latter-day chart entries , like 1983 's # 2 hit `` my oh my '' , but slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak , and `` feel the noize '' captures them in all their glory , filled with noddy holder and jim lea 's big , dumb , misspelled shout-along hits ( `` look wot you dun '' , `` mama weer all crazee now '' , `` skweeze me , pleeze me '' and `` gudbuy t'jane '' )
0	i bought this because a few people had put it in their amazon lists . i just did n't like it at all . it is one of those albums where you play it , and you do n't take notice of it until the cd stops playing . it is very old and the music is simplistic . cool cover though
0	these guys were the nirvana of r , motown , soul , black music in the 90s . as nirvana was the band that ended good white music . boyz to men was the band that ended good black music . i am kinda pissed because nobody seems to notice it like i do . these guys especially the lead singer would always sing , oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence . i mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or rick james . i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul type music . barry white , whitney houston , bobby brown , the temptations isaac hayes luther vandross . i mean in the 90s i think almost every r group was better than boyz to girls . i dont understand why these guys are so popular . i guess its just like seinfeld it sucks bad but people like it . its like all these idiots were born yesterday forgetting about quality music and sitcoms from the past that were better .
1	this is the best cd i have ever listened to ! i highly recommend i
0	jj , the name of the song you are looking for is `` like you like an arsonist '' by paris texas
0	there is at times , a fine line between noise and music . nin not only crossed that line in this cd , but stomped on it a few times in the process . not even close to the calibre of with teeth , this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians . songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide , while `` playing '' the same thing over and over and ... well , you get my drift . if great music is your thing , pass this one up . or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination
1	this is a wonderful album , that evokes memories of the 60 's folk boom , yet contains original songs . i was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements . anyone who loves the movie `` a mighty wind '' and who loves folk music will fall in love with this album . i know i did
0	yep , this cd sucks . that depeche mode guy is really random , what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in depeche mode ? rem sucks too , michael stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever .
1	i have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my cd changer . i played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more , and it was one of the first cds i bought . a relative first introduced me to this album and of course `` coming up close '' was the reason i bought my own copy . but i came to love each song and appreciate aimee mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter . it is a great `` road trip '' album and `` on sunday '' makes the perfect `` summer song '' . the mix is not mainstream pop/rock . it is not a 1980 's anthem , but it is one of the defining moments , for me . the lyrics have meaning , which sometimes defies what the '80 's were about . the only other thing i can say is listen to this cd ! i am sure you will find mann 's unique voice as captivating as i do . it is a definite must have for one 's cd library
0	i bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk . these suggested that eloy 's silent cries and mighty echoes album was redolent of pink floyd and yes . actually it is , but only both bands at their very worst . the album opens with an inept attempt at gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973 , moves on to some truly rank singing , with the singer 's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong german accent and thus the suspicion that he does n't understand the absurdity of the lyrics . actually , at times the lyrics do remind one of jon anderson at his silliest , although we forgave mr anderson and yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters . with silent cries mighty echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock , the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity . that this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself . it would have been appalling in 1972 . to discover it was recorded in december 1978 is gob-smacking . unforgiveable tosh
1	europe and japan - the final great pop frontiers ! ... .last i heard it was austin ? - oh well ! canada shows love too ... our favorite neighbors ... .do ya a favor ! there are some really interesting japanese based labels ... search on web and be impressed !
1	wow what a great cd . i 'm a big music fan of alot of different types of music and i have to say that this is one of the best cds that came out in 2004 . you ca n't go wrong with this one . a
0	here 's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album : if a song is remixed , then that remix should be better than the original song . otherwise , what 's the point ? with that being said , nu-mixx klazzics is pretty much pointless . this is nothing more than a cash in album . the people at death row/koch know that folks will continue to buy pac 's music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it ( especially the die hards ... they 'll buy anything associated with the man ) . well , the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible . if you have the source material , stick with that . these `` remixes '' do n't make the originals better , they actually make them worse . the beats sound like throw away beats from an old jt tha bigga figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered/changed so that they sound updated ( removing snoop from `` 2 of amerikka 's most ... '' and distorting pac 's vocals when he says his name is just terrible ) , but these changes are only for the worst . in short , all aspects of this album are sorry . the guests are wack and the beats are generic , hollow , `` clubby '' beats . remember y'all , when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had more meat to them . there is one decent track though . `` life goes on '' gets a different look and i 'm not so sure that it 's all that bad . i find it tolerable , but i could see why why someone would n't like it . but this is coming from someone that was n't all that crazy about the original because i was n't feeling the beat . if you enjoyed the original , then stick with that . also , i like that the original version of `` hit 'em up '' was used here . in this version , 'pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with ( thus proving that he was n't anti - east coast , just anti - bad boy ) . whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired . it 's a shame that folks are pimping tupac 's music like this . but they 'll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it . i 'm drawing the line here . shame on you , suge . your label is n't relevant anymore , get over it and move on . standout tracks : do n't even waste your time looking for an
1	this cd is well worth buying . but to you blues aficionado 's who rely on shaq 's recommendations , let me put it in terms you 'll understand . coco is no srv , or an albert , or a buddy . he 's definitely a large step below them . but he is also not a lounge singer type like smokin joe kubek , lil ed and the blue imperials , etc . coco , is a large step above them . this cd seems to pick up steam with each song . he shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs . he performs a great ballad , with a johnny copeland , song ( # 6 ) , that 's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long . ( i could have said 6 minutes , but shaq do n't fool around when it comes to da blues ! ) new , good blues is hard to find , and till `` jumping joe '' bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues , this is one of the best of the last year , along with walter trout 's `` full circle ''
1	these guys and this album rocks . just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head , does n't 'demote ' it to pop . props to the great use of two bass guitars . released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90 's , this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again . this album is highly recommended . kill your television , grey cell green , cut up , throwing things , happy , and until you find out are just an awesome experience . if you can find the grey cell green single release , i highly recommend that for the track entitled 'trust . '
0	i bought this cd after having seen ken burns ' special on pbs . the energy that came through on screen in the benny goodman segments does n't really come through in this cd . artie shaw said that benny goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability . that shows in this collection . afterall , where would jazz be if jazz musicians did n't take risks
1	it all started when i was a little kid and my dad gave me this album ( he was n't a fan , he probably picked it up with a crate of used records . ) it was one of my first exposures to rock and roll . nearly 30 years later i still own the original vinyl ( the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover . ) i am glad to have it now on cd , the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable . i dissent the reviewers who praise ducann over crane , for really , it is after all vincent crane 's project ( crane , also organist for crazy world of arthur brown . ) a keyboard player myself i consider crane one of my biggest influences and i hold great admiration for his playing . ducann and hammond also deserve praise for their performances , but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is : um , the audience ... er , no the organist ! take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work
1	what an awesome cd ... i bought a flogging molly cd as well but dropkick murphy 's are better by far !
0	this is the only album i own of joe strummer minus the clash . i ca n't say it 's very good . i hate having to compare it with it with his work with the clash but it 's inevitable . his lyrics are n't as great , edgy or provocative . there is n't any fantastic music either . i am not really sure what to say since i have n't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad , i truly tried my hardest to like it . but i feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake . believe me : i absolutely love everything about the clash , the lyrics , joe 's voice , the music , the attitude and how cool they were , this is not joe at his best , it 's cool though cause now he 's gone : go buy some bob marley albums instead , joe would not have minded
0	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated . i am writing to confirm that assertion . i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here , but what a disappointment this album was for me . it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door . my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down . jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable , but only realised on the song `` i fought piranhas '' . tellingly , this is the final song on the album . otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times .
0	especially when there 's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful . the songs are so cheesy , her voice is out of place in half the songs . it 's whiny , irritating , dull and at this point , i 'm not sure who 's more talented , her or her sister . they got the looks , sure , but there 's lots of pretty girls in this world , does n't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd . that 's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album . i 'm sorry jes , but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say
0	as much as i have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled `` chemistry '' between buckshot and 9th wonder . the beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone . they are working on a part two so i hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was .
1	at first , i thought the only reason why i wanted this cd was because idina menzel was on it . but now , after listening to the whole cd , i was right , idina menzel was amazing , and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too . i would highly recommend this because it is a very interesting story , it 's incredibly complex music ( theoretically ) , but at the same time it is very enjoyable ! ! ! ! i would give it more stars if i could ... but i am only allowed 5 ... : (
1	ac/dc is the greatest band ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this cd has my fav song on it rock n roll damnation i luv both eras , bon scott and brian johnso
1	i 'm not particularly familiar with sonic youth and the bits i 've heard from their other albums have n't really grabbed me . this does . the rhythm section would n't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk , the guitars are dissonant , jangling , sometimes hypnotically repetitive , and just plain weird , and the vocals are distant , airy , lazy . some of the best music i 've heard in a good long while
1	omg ! ! this is relient ks best cd yet . you should buy it , even if you did n't care for their other cds . because ... .well ... it rocks ! !
0	let 's get one thing straight - radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the beatles . that said , this is not the album for that reason . do not let this album turn you off from radiohead ... beacause it is truly not what they are about . there is one hint though in where radiohead will go . in the song `` creep '' , which is not a fantastic song , there is a brilliant `` chu-chunk '' made by johnny greenwood . so please - if you are trying to get into radiohead ... go somewhere else . for the `` rockers '' - get the bends , for people trying to expand their musical mind - get ok computer , and if you like that you may become obsessed with kid a . there are some unbelievable songs on amnesiac , but it is not their most cohesive album , and hail to the theif is very solid . thank you for your time
0	the music of dowland is wonderful - but sting is n't up to interpreting it . you ca n't even distinguish the words half the time , just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he does n't possess the skills to carry it off . this music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language ... sting , for all his merits , has n't got that in his repertoire yet . it 's an exercise in pretention , laughable at times . the letter reading is ridiculous . i love both sting 's voice and dowland 's song , but this cd is a failure .
1	good stuff ! an excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes , artfully performed by jorgenson . i recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of john jorgenson and the genius of django reinhardt
1	i bought this cd before going to see mmw ( with john scofield ) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec 7 , 2006 . i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website . so i bought a ticket and wanted to get `` out louder '' , which i knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store i was at was out of it . so i bought `` end of the world '' instead . while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , i still liked the overall funkiness of it all . then ... .i saw them play . you must see them play ! ! i did n't ever want it to end ! i immediately wanted to see them again ! it 's less than a week later and i have 2 more cd 's ( `` out louder '' and scofield 's `` a-go-go '' which they `` back '' him on ) and 4 more on the way from amazon as i 'm writing this . i 'm like an addict now ! i have to have them on in the car and in the house . i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again . i must say i like `` out louder '' and even `` a-go-go '' better than `` end of the world '' , but only slightly . it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and i do like it better after a few listens . i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians
0	i sorta of agree with the person below , this album sucks ... .plain and simple , however i think he is still doing a great job in rhapsody . i gave it one star not so much because it is garbage , but becuase i was looking forward to this album since `` prophets of the last eclipse '' which was great , but trully ... i do n't know went wrong . i do n't have a problem with female vocalists , but in this album ... it is retched . i do n't think i will ever listen to this album ever again . sorry ! but its true ... do not buy this album , pretend you never knew he had a new album ... oh ! and do not buy luca turilli 's dreamquest either ! another bomb
0	as if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough . a f***'in grease video ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ja officially became a diva with this album . this album is horrible . the pledge had some life due to nas appearance , thats why it 's hard for me to request a zero star rating . bottomline if ja 's body was made up of his albums , this part would gangrene , maggots would avoid this and you should too
0	that this great music sounds so awful on this cd . i wanted an introduction to kate bush 's music , and this cd seemed a very good way to start . when i put it on , i could n't believe how muffled and dull it sounded . i could swear i 'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton . i went to the existing reviews here on amazon , and , sure enough , ferrara brain pan 's spot-on review stated exactly what i was feeling upon listening to these recordings . it is inexcusable that an artist of bush 's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame , considering how good the songs are . another little beef is that the cd clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words , there 's room for 30 more minutes of music , which i 'm certain could have been well-used , considering the vastness of her catalogue . i will be looking for the remastered individual albums , but if i did n't know how good kate bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection , i would n't bother buying any more of her material . shame on emi for allowing this . i give it two stars ( instead of one ) simply because the music is so very good
0	i 'm sorry to vent on the stylistics , certainly others are guilty of this , but $ 33 to get all the stylistics hits is way too expensive . sorry , love the stylistics , and the spinners too ( whose double cd anthology is around $ 30 too ) . why is something like lionel richie and the commodores 2cd gold $ 13.99 ? oh well ... i 'll wait
1	it 's fair to say that all orchestras are not created ( or built ) equally and these discs of phenomenal playing with the berlin philharmonic under the baton of herbert von karajan are simply some of the best classical recordings ever made . analog sound was at its peak when these records were made in 1976 and 77 and dg has done an excellent job of remastering them for cd . but beyond that karajan simply `` gets '' the composer -- as another reviewer pointed out -- and conducts with an intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings and performances . i 'm listening to these discs once more on a massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the '70s kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever . as a reviewer once said of a classic szell/cleveland performance of beethoven 's third , this is a reading of `` blinding virtuosity and strength . '' as a budget two disc set it is also , incredibly enough , cheaper than those old dg import records we bought ( and scratched up ) one by one in the seventies . as i 've said before , when you listen to a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of music in the first place . buy it , blast it , love it , get your slavic ya yas out ! !
1	both the italian version ( io canto ) and the spanish version ( yo canto ) are excellent , and amongst the best albums that i have heard this past year . the music is absolutely beautiful , fresh , and very well paced , and laura 's voice is soaring ! the quality of this album is exceptional ... .the production of the songs lends to laura 's very passionate approach to them . without understanding a word of either version , i can not get enough of them ! listening to laura on this latest release of hers over and over again , each song continues to grow on me and i find myself completely absorbed in this album ! do yourself a favor and get this one ... .especially if you live in the united states . it will give you an opportunity to experience the power of what music can be if done right . you 'll find yourself relating to words you do n't even understand !
0	i could not wait to get this album . i usually love to hear the new the hypnotize minds albums . however after so many years groups do make mistakes . this is a major one . chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch . i own the original copies of every prophet/hypnotize relese since mystic styles , and this is by far the worst to emerge . they never release a lord infamous solo album in 12 years ( not to mention he is dj paul 's brother ... wait i just did ) and now this ? ? ? what 's next , a crunchy black album lol ? ? this is a personal note to dj paul and juicy j ... please swallow your pride and re-hire ( at least ) t-rock , gangsta boo , mc mack , and bribe some judges to get lord infamous out of jail ! ! ! p.s.- this only gets 2 stars for the production value .
1	what can be said about this album ? this is one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith/enthusiasm in music ( those who listen to a lot of albums know what i mean ) . some tracks from here were most famously covered by nirvana on their unplugged album , although pained i do n't think cobain quite got the feel that kirkwood gives to these songs . it has a perfect blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those that you can just reflect on and chill out . particular stand outs on this album are split myself in two , magic toy missing , aurora borealis and the whistling song . this album does take some growing as kirkwood 's voice is abrasive , but this is an album that will truly make you love music . do try it , you wo n't be disappointed .
1	ice cube is back for his 6th solo with the peace disc . this may be my favorite album from cube ( close with `` lethal injection '' ) . his lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it 's still nice to hear from cube . with 13 songs , none ar ebad , 5 are ok , 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good . guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough cube to satisfy you . production is decent as well , chuckey thompson one eye each do 3 songs , puff daddy , younglord , bud'da , battlecat , dr. dre , t-bone and charley bear all do 1 song . a must have album for fans of ice cube . # 1 - 8.5 ( f/ mc ren dr. dre -- n.w.a . reunion ) # 3 - 8.5 # 4 - 8.5 ( f/ jayo felony , gangsta from the comrads and squeek ru ) # 5 - 7.5 ( 1 minute intro before he raps ) # 7 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) # 8 - 9.5 ( f/ krayzie bone -- nice beat ) # 9 - 7.5 ( f/ mack 10 ms. toi -- also on the `` next friday '' soundtrack ) # 11 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) # 12 - 7 # 13 - 7 # 15 - 7.5 # 16 - 8 ( good beat ) # 17 - 8 o'shea jackson -- b . 6/15/69 check all my review
1	this is an amazing ep - one of boards of canada 's strongest to date . honestly , i did n't enjoy dayvan cowboy that much on campfire headphase , but since it has been recontectualized on trans canada highway , i 'm a huge fan of the song . the new tracks are more like what one would typically expect from boards of canada . warm , fuzzy , mellow , lush analogue synths and plenty of them ! for those who were n't as taken with the newer boc sound on campfire headphase , assuage your fears - this is definitely a return to the traditional sound . that 's not to say though that this is a rehash of old material . one can hear bits and pieces of geogaddi and such , but the overall feel is much closer to music has the right to children . to all boards of canada fans - buy this without hesitation . it does n't matter what you thought of campfire - this is quality . i have one question . the title , trans canada highway , seems to be a fairly obvious reference to kraftwerk 's legendary trans europe express and the album cover seems to point to kraftwerk 's autobahn album cover , but i do n't hear any explicit musical connection . is boards of canada paying a simple titular tribute to kraftwerk , or is there something else buried within ? this calls for repeated listenings
1	this album is great but i 'm looking for a song that i think they sung . it goes : pressing on we 're pressing on ( repeat ) . waiting on jesus to answer our call we 're holding on ( repeat ) pressing , pressing , pressing . if anyone knows the name of the song , or has any suggestions on who sings this song , please email me at udeebear1984 @ yahoo.com . thank you and have a blessed day ! :
0	i just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation . in this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round . that song is not listed on the song track and i think it should be . the song is atrevido by orishas . i think this is wrong .
1	all i can say is you must try this !
0	this is a copy of the review on amazon.com for van zant 's get right with the man which is another sony corrupted title . `` this cd secretly installs drm ( digital rights management ) software on your pc without your permission . not only does it do this , but the software then hides itself by installing as a `` root kit . '' as per wikipedia , -- root kit from wikipedia , the free encyclopedia . a root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system . these tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes . root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as linux , solaris and versions of microsoft windows . a rootkit typically hides logins , processes , files , and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals , network connections , and the keyboard . in many sources , rootkits are counted as trojan horses . -- in this instance , sony installs drm software to copy protect their cd , and prevent it from being copied to various devices , all the while not telling you , the user , or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and windows . manually trying to uninstall it like some people have done , results in their cd-rom drives disappearing entirely from windows , as sony installs their own custom cd-rom drivers onto the system . do not support this wreckless kind of copy protection . show the music business this is *your* music . *you* purchased it , and they should *not* be able to dictate how you can use it . do not buy this cd. `` a list of affected titles can be found here : http : //www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004144.php and another part of an amazon.com review for the van zant cd `` amazon rocks . they pulled they infected cd 's from sale and allowed these reviews that tell of the problems . shame on sony they not only messed with the consumers but also the artists .

1	the music here frequently reminded me of pagan 's mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden . a fantastic mixture of 1970s progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european-style power metal and brazilian folk music . while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that do n't quite mesh . in actuality i give the cd 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired , sometimes flawed ambition . but as an overall package , this special edition of `` temple of shadows '' is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog . this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums ( not to mention it 's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves , smiling throughout the show ) . highly recommended .
1	that nigga 's crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs , but it would still rank high if it was n't for the poor sound quality -- there 's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time . but some great classic bits , and believe me you 're never bored
0	i just sold this back through amazon , i was so disapointed with it . it 's an all cover record , and while greg duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers , all of the music feels too subdued , too flat . duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the whigs and the first twilight singers recording .
1	this album is awesome ! ! ! ! my favorites are pure and appreciate .
1	this was the first queen album that i ever had so getting it on cd is great . `` sheer heart attack '' is an overlooked queen gem
1	so many times , older recordings are not very high quality but not with this group of songs . if you are a marty robbins fan ( and i am ) this cd is a must
0	i was really excited when i received tone poems iii as a gift . wow , grisman and brozman ! two amazing fret men playing some wonderful vintage instruments . i could n't wait to hear some excellent acoustic bluesy slide and reso music . unfortunately , this recording comes across like sugar poured on the tongue . if you like sitting around in beach wear and listening to hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this is the recording for you . ( in fairness , track 15 , `` style o blues , '' and track 20 , `` new steal , '' are wonderful . they have some drive and get-up-and-go . ) i also own tone poems i , which grisman did with flatpicker extraodinaire tony rice . that recording is also mostly a lightweight . i play mandolin and fiddle , and recognize david grisman as the world 's master with the mando . i also appreciate what he 's doing with his acoustic disc recording label . these days , however , he seems to be better off when other musicians are running the show . the recent recordings with vasser clements and old and in the gray are great . `` hold on , we 're stummin ' , '' with sam bush , is the best new mandolin record i 've heard . buy it and go to acoustic heaven ! for my hard-earned money , however , the tone poems cds have turned out to be an expensive set of matching drink coasters . i just know that musicians of this caliber , playing instruments of this quality , could have given us a better selection of music .
0	released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia , presumably to meet high demand for ac/dc 's music , this international version of `` dirty deeds done dirt cheap '' is a farce . once again , somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence , and replacing both `` r.i.p . ( rock in peace ) '' and `` jailbreak '' , two of the strongest numbers in the album 's aussie version , with t.n.t . 's `` rocker '' and `` love at first feel '' , an ok , if not spectacular song . ah , and `` problem child '' , already featured in atlantic 's version of `` let there be rock '' , is also included in here . the same song in two different `` official albums '' . marvelous ! . oh yeah , and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re-design the front and back covers . that was a cute detail , but the aussie version 's covers ( classic mid 70 's cartoonish artwork ) are far more appealing . who 's to blame for this rip off ? . somebody at atlantic records ? . some members of ac/dc ? . maybe both ? . who cares anyway ? . once again , now that i 've got used to the aussie album , listening back to this `` product '' feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated , low quality spirits . every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took , and still take risks , by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will . so , it seems that , with their approval of this re-issue , the surviving members of ac/dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on , and on , and on ... if this is so ... well ... guys , we , the fans made you filthy rich . we deserve the `` real deal '' , available worldwide , at a `` reasonable price '' . i only give this `` product '' a 2 star rating , just because `` love at first feel '' remains unreleased in australia . how unusual ! . a final word about this re-issue : i do n't own it . in the words of pete townshend , i `` wo n't get fooled again '' . in order to get bonus material , you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick . if bon scott ( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever ) , was still alive , i believe things would be different . by the way , if you are interested in the real stuff , please be so kind as to read my review of `` dirty deeds done dirt cheap '' ( import ) . other items to be avoided : the skimpy `` retrospective '' ep `` '74 jaibreak '' , and `` bonfire '' , a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice , in different versions . none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac/dc 's first four aussie albums
0	not what i expected . it was n't as 'manly ' as i had hoped
1	this is the only albulm i have of the exies for christmas i am getting the last albulm . if its the same as this one the exies must be good . this is the best albulm i have listened to . my favourites are ugly , babtise me , splinter and dear enemy my least favourites are none i like every song its an amazing albulm . ihave listened to some of the tracks over and over again and everytime i think wow this band should be more popular from craig from the uk
0	i remember when this recording came out and wynton marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz . i picked it up right away . i was mystified by the souless mimicry of art blakey 's jazz messengers and miles ' 2nd great quintet -- this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz ? listen as wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements , stopping on a dime ! marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars ! ! gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of think of one that strips the tune of any semblence of swing ! ! ! i get it , wynton -- you 've mastered the trumpet , technically speaking , which is no mean feat . and you can read music . bully for you . the only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say . ordinarily , i 'd feel sorry for you , having wasted all those hours of practice , except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you are n't worthy of washing . people like john coltrane , joe zawinul , miles davis , wayne shorter , herbie hancock ... i could go on and on , but i think you get the point . this music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber , thus killing it .
1	jodeci 's forever my lady has a problem that most nineties r releases had at that time , if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa . jodeci 's first cd had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one cd in 1991 . stay , forever my lady , come talk to me , u , and i 'm still waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash
1	this one came out in '91 . its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass . one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track . so it forces you to listen to this long , winding , sludgefest in its entirety . as most melvins fans know , this ( along with houdini ) was the pinacle of their musical career . after this , they made some great albums and some good ones , but never better than their self-titled album ( previously titled `` lysol '' , but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit ) . it would be ultra-cool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment . it definitely deserves it
0	the dvd says : nelly - the longest yard , boom , fly away and errtime ; no doubt - hella good ; natasha barr - move ; nicole kindle - oh my , oh my ! ; lynard skynard - saturday night special ; murphy lee - stomp ; jet - are you gon na be my girl ; the hollies - long cool woman ( in a black dress ) ; 216 - u should know ; public enemy - give it up and opus de soul ; d12 - my ballz and peter gunn theme ; michael kamen buckethead - jack the ripper ; mountain - mississippi queen ; methods of mayhem - narcotic ; the crystal method - roll it up ; big head todd the monsters - boom boom ; ccr - have you ever seen the rain and bootleg ; david shire - fall-off truck and cats dogs ; thomas newman - creek house ; wayne hancock - railroad blues ; norman greenbaum - spirit in the sky ; union turnpike - oh ; ludacris feat . lazyeye - get back ( clean rock mix ) ; ac/dc - thunderstruck and if you want blood ( you 've got it ) ; red hot chili peepers - higher ground ; kool keith kutmasas kurt - break u off ; univ of southern california - usc drum cadence ; tracie spencer - still in my heart ; yea that 's different and prolly a double cd ... off to itunes : )
0	as others have noted , this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in spanish sung by maria del rey , plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men ( not very good for putting a baby to sleep ) , plus the whole thing repeated in english . in addition , i had been looking for traditional latin american pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary . do n't waste your money ... i 'm planning on giving my copy away if i can figure out someone i know who could actually use it
1	if you are expecting `` safari moon pt . 2 '' , you will be dissapointed . air took a more adventuourous , darker , ambient , serious , experimental , and ultimtately brilliant journey into electronic music . the songs here range from sounding like aphex twin ( without the weird off-putting effects or heavy drums ) to thievery corp. air still has a beautiful sense of melody and as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put together ( even a throwaway air song is a well-crafted one ) . overall , all us true hardcore air fans love this album . those who only loved ms may not like it , but that 's their loss i say
0	on the track , '' cleo 's mood '' , it sounds like something that bookert.and the mg 's , along with the mar-key horns would 've cut . it sounds like steve cropper on the guitar , and booker t.jones on the keyboards.the sax style is definately jr.it 's a soothing piece
0	the title says it all . they could have put a better group of songs togather
1	it does n't get any better than this . this album is a must have for all true judas priest fans . this is priest when they were really getting good . the guitars and the vocals rock you to the core
0	if you do n't have the blues , this record will give them to you.musically speaking , it 's tripe
0	i never write reviews for anything , but this one was so bad , i could n't help myself . everybody has different tastes , but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all , you will not like belladonna . i could not make sense of it at all , it rambled on and on , never getting to the point , never picking a path , never building on a theme . it bored me with it 's vague attempts to build a song . i listened to it 2 times just to make sure i was n't imagining how bad it was , and then i dumped it . it was not my style , and i do n't see how it could be anybody 's style , but that 's just me . i felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed . good luck on your listing adventures
1	i personally like this compilation of prince , it 's got most of the songs i like and the sound is great . sure , there could have been a few more songs included , like `` pop life '' , `` hot thing '' , but when compared to the other compilations , this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have , for me , such as `` i wan na be your lover '' , which i do n't think was included on any of the other compilations . so , it 's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want , so that 's why i chose this disc and i 'm glad i did !
1	okay ! ! ! after their debut album , i was like okay , they are sad over the revolution being disbanded.well ! ! ! ! fruit at the bottom was like , okay , we 're over it , let 's jam ! ! ! i saw the video for are you my baby on bet ! ! ! they were just too funky for mtv back in the day ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the album was like a cup of yogurt ! ! ! ! ! the cream was at the top ! ! ! lolly lollywas like the princest cut-they stormed out of the box with the distorted helium vocals , then are you ... baby ? , man , hold up ! ! ! ! you did n't see it comin ' ! ! ! ! you knew this is what they were capable of ! ! ! ! corey glover of living colour said this was one of his favorite albums ! then after the satisfactionblast with jesse johnson , formerly of the time and his own solo work , they slow it down for always in my dreamsthis was the jammm ! ! ! ! so melodic and works that just have you thinking about writing you own quiet storm ! wendy has always seem to sing from the heart ! she believes in the words and on this song , she 's showing the listener that love stilland always will exists.form now on , we 're oneis my favorite track and i tell you why , lisa ! lisa ! lisa ! she 's so quiet ! when her vocals lead , you just listen ! ! ! ! the lyrics and the music are so uplifting , you just soar from the start to the end ! this is a special album because they sound like they had fun making it ! ! ! ! you 'll have fun listening to it ! ! ! !
1	unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide , and fortified roots reggae album ! if you do n't have firehouse rock in your cd collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan , you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about jamaican music . the roots radics , especially the rythym section , utilize ( with supreme efficacy , i might add ) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae `` riddims . '' on top of the radics , the wailing souls add ethereal vocals , while staying masterfully conscious . firehouse rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible jamaican history and an absolute must have
1	i just love this cd . over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album . it is definetly not just for st paddy 's day . this is an album you can listen to over and over . the sinead songs are a bit whiney , but she does have an excellent voice . you can not get better that mic and sting . sting 's song is just incredible .
1	this was the second tribe album i bought i was gon na get this cd before i got the low end theory but they did n't have it at the best buy i went to . i like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip . most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot . all like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein , afterhours , foot prints , i left my wallet in el segundo , bonita applebum , can i kick it , rhythm , go ahead in the rain , and description of a fool . man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable . i wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd . the only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs . this is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics .
1	nice cd cool beats songs like welcome to atlanta pick it u
0	well i 'll explain that later . she uses her own vocals . she does n't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.i love how the editoral review uses the term `` unique vocal talent '' . yoko has no vocal talents . i must also point out i am courtney love 's number one fan , so this should give me even more cred . it just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she wo n't let other artists do an album using their own vox . she loves the sound of her own too much ! i already went through that stage where i made everyone listen her as a joke . i was about 14 then . my point here , this is n't even a good joke . its just dumb . i listened to the song clips provided on amazon . even that was too much . if you must , just download this album for free . do not buy it . do not in any way support this woman . i wish there was a zero star rating .
1	forza eros ! may you live to make much more great music ! whether you understand italian or not , i heartily recommend this cd . in ogni senso lives up to its billing- it delights each and every one of the human senses , in all `` sense '' of the expression . this is a must-have for any true music lover
0	history has a way of making the radical seem conservative , and certainly within the context of cecil taylor 's music , his debut album , `` jazz advance '' is rather conservative . taylor , known for his relentless , dense music , did not emerge fully formed ( although even at this early date , his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries ) , but developed over time . for those of us who enjoy taylor 's music , this record is a historical curiosity , for anyone else , its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early ornette coleman idiom ( indeed , this music is far closer to coleman 's sound than anything taylor would be doing in the '60s or later ) . my understanding is that when this was first released , it raised quite a stir . its a bit difficult to see why . taylor is largely melodic -- performing pieces with coherent themes -- his experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords , odd inversions , and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this point . the record is four originals and four standards , and as one would suspect , taylor largely breathes on his own compositions . he is backed by nearly inaudible bassist buell neidlinger and drummer dennis charles , with soprano sax player steve lacy on two tracks . neidlinger and charles are far closer in the hard bop idiom -- their performances swing , charles in particular is playing way inside hard bop . this puts them a bit at odds with taylor , who , while he gives more space than he would on his later work , is still more of a neoclassical improvising pianist than a jazz pianist . when lacy plays , taylor 's form of comping does n't seem fully formed , or lacy does n't seem quite prepared to play inside taylor 's environment , and as a result he sounds somewhat detached from the pianist . the sounds of the future can clearly be heard on several tracks , `` bemsha swing '' features many of taylor 's clustered chords and runs , solo piano take on `` you 'd be so nice to come home to '' presents the theme in a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future organized chaos as he 'd get , and while original `` rick kick shaw '' is far away from where he 'd end up , its the first sign of the short of aggression that taylor would harness in the future . the music is enjoyable enough , but taylor would reach such heights that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his future works . the other complaint is the sound -- this issue is from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering . in the end , this is an album of historical value . if you 're looking for an introduction to taylor 's music and are n't ready to dive head first into his methods , try `` looking ahead ! `` , its a far superior album by which point neidlinger and charles ( who reprise their roles ) were far more closely integrated with taylor 's music
0	this is not the music from the movie . this purchase was a major dissapointment . you would do beter searching for the music credits for titles , then download the tracks form your music subscriber
1	this is the best album/band noones ever heard of . this is the most underrated bands ever ( including fm static. ) and they deserve some appreciation . this cd is a great rock cd and it has a bit of seemingly hip-hop bits here and there in just about every song . almost every song on this cd rocks , so buy it
1	( in reference to another review ) - the symbol on the cover of still is the factory records logo , joy division 's record label . since i 'm in the area ... . i 've owned this album for about 15 years and it still sounds , in parts , as solid as anything joy division ever did . some of the live stuff is so-so but studio tracks like the kill , dead souls , exercise one , they walked in line and something must break are damn near worth the price of admission alone . if you already like joy division , thereby showing good taste , this is a great album . if you find yourself slowly descending beneath the black cloud of depression , unknown pleasures should fit . if you have been there and find yourself wanting out , closer is the soundtrack . this album is more varied in mood , for established fans and safer for household pets
1	this is a really great cd . the candian and american idol winners are not usually that great , but melissa is an exception . she just belts out her soul whenever she 's at the microphone . my absolute favourite is definitely `` alive '' . it 's just a beautiful song . really , i recommend this cd who likes songs with great messages and a good beat . she 's a great pop/rock singer . you ca n't go wrong with this cd
0	boney used to be the man , but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him . anyone who thinks this cd is good should listen to his older stuff like seduction , trust , or backbone . you will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential . cmon'boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of . peace

1	a true musical theater classic . wonderful melodies that will last for years to come . other classics not to forget about are : mary poppins my fair lady the wizard of oz chitty chitty bang band the first charlie and the chocolate factory the sound of music oliver west side story fiddler on the roof singing in the rain the wiz little mermaid aladdin beauty and the beast grease the king and i oklahoma the music man south pacific my voice students are always asking me for recommendations so i though i 'd post it for all ! we ca n't forget about these great musicals
0	i 'm sure it was fun for van to record a bunch of songs he likes , but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg . thanks for all the great music through the healing game . all good times have to come to an end
1	i was waiting in anticipation for this cd to arrive and was not disapointed . etta is the bes
0	my youngest brother , who has a pretty strange sense of humor , bought me this cd for my birthday ; i wonder how he knew i did n't own it already ? i do n't even know where to begin with this one . what can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop ? and the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable . does she expect anyone to take her seriously ? after her first album , i thought carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning , particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches . instead of getting better , though , she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices . rappers like jay-z , snoop dogg , missy elliott and usher are brought in to add spice , but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing . she may have a lot of # 1 hits , but who can tell any of them apart ? rainbow is only carey 's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere . d- tom rya
0	i knew this would n't be the sia from zero 7 's album . little did i know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents zero 7 have behind the mixing boards . the song production is terrible . i could n't find one song i really liked on this cd . sia truly has a unique voice but it 's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight . still , i 'm severely disappointed , particularly because i had to pay for this cd as an import
1	sounding thing occurred when ex-springfield messina melded with loggins , and it was large ! c.s.n.y . strove to be this good every time they released a tune . this compilation not only displays the music-crafting abilities of these two in conjunction , but also showcases their power to deliver dynamic live performances . dedicated to todd j
1	after trouble and his austin city limits appearance , i thought he was just another very good singer songwriter . this follow up has made me reconsider , because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist . he waited and it was worth the wait . this reminded me immediately of john lennon ( please do n't punish me for blasphemy ) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way . i did n't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording . enjoy
1	i can only say that this was my favorite record of last year . this record is hard to find in your local record store , so search it out ... incredible - ca n't wait to hear more !
1	everyone has their favorite beatle . some people love to complain about paul 's solo music , comparing it to john 's . the fact is that each of the beatles had their own style , and together they had a magical symbiosis . separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew . so paul 's music is light hearted ? maybe even silly ? sure , but if you are like me and enjoy each beatle for what they brought to the group , then this is a wonderful album . no you wo n't find deep soul searching here , just fun ! and fun is what this album has in abundance . so if you want to curse paul for his naivet , do n't buy this album . if you loved the beatles , and enjoyed each one for their individual talent , this is a fun solo album . in my humble opinion it is paul 's best solo album , as he really spreads his `` wings '' and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear . later albums seem to become too engineered , and never seem to have the same energy that this album has .
1	and he know 's nothing about popular music and really should get back to work and stop sitting around convincing himself that he does . dumbass
1	the best place to start with the best is at the beginning . enya 's the celts ( identical to the original 1980s release simply called enya ) is a beautiful collection of music . enya is not an artist where you just get the `` best of '' album . every cd is a best of in itself
0	if you 're looking for billie in her prime , look elsewhere . all the music on this cd was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice . look for the classic recording of strange fruit from '39 on one of the other cds available .
1	first off , i 'd like to say that i am not a country music fan , but i am a johnny cash fan . he transcends the genre that turned his back on him in his later years , but here the man can do no wrong . now , i bought the 2000 `` expansion '' release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the `` complete concert recording '' . it was misleading because i had seen the british documentary ( the dvd of this is included in the set ) in which johnny friends were performing songs i never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on cd . now this is the full sha-bang , complete with amazing packaging , the concert spread over two cds , and the dvd mentioned above . if you bought the previous cd like i did , let me tell you , this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the `` definitive end to all release '' of johnny singing to the boys at san quentin . for new fans , the single cd release might be the best place to start since it has at least 85 % of what johnny sang that night at san quentin . the rest of the legacy tracks feature the carter family , carl perkins , and the statler bros . so if you 're looking for a `` johnny cash '' solo concert , then get the single cd version . if you want the absolute complete version in a great package , 40 page booklet , and he legendary british documentary of this concert for the first time on dvd ; the legacy edition of this memorable night is the way to go
1	if you are a fan of the winter 's solstice series , than you will enjoy this cd , especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music .
0	i have to admit , i expected a lot more from mr setzer . the first track was ok , then it proceeded to go down hill from there . not much rockabilly happening , then it all comes clear with `` really rockabilly '' when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans ... world wide . he even gives us aussies a serv , even though i do n't think he has ever set foot here . if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing , jazz , rock or whatever , then go ahead , but why slag your old fans ? . it 's the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first
1	i do n't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer , jorge rossy , and the bassist , larry grenadier , `` are competent but do nothing overtly interesting '' . jorge incredible groove , use of space , and musicality is as good as one could ask for , and grenadier 's huge warm tone , amazing time , and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation
0	this cd is garbage . juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album . he was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one . if i was you dont listen to the retards who tell you `` this is a good comeback album '' . instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend welcome back by mase . that is a good comeback album . the only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of mannie fresh . juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats . a shame they could n't go to ja rule , whose cd sucked with his beats . he has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow
0	agreed , the fan is there , but i must admit they are actually singing well in the actual solesmes style ( based on these samples ) . i have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant . this is not as bad as it gets i assure you . try to find something from a seminary or monastery
0	don`t waste your time and money on this compilation . what a cheap shot to take the consumers money . read the very fine print , it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it . shame on the distributor !
0	i ordered this cd based on the reviews . first , i have to say that i am not sure why it is called 'paris under a groove ' . i was thinking that it would be in french , at least . the beats are nice , i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar.. i just was n't as thrilled as i thought that i would be . it sounded very cheap . no originality . my fiancee is from paris , and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present ... .so far , it sits on the shelf..
1	i admit when i listened to this album i was blown away by the powerful content of kenny g 's music . i was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during the movie . kenny g 's music is perfect for this kind of movie . not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show . this is the perfect soundtract for the movie dying young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie
1	when this first was released i really was n't expecting much . the last two releases mega-dave put out risk , and the world needs a hero excluding the live rude awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5 material , but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around . however , this album from the up tempo blackmail the universe , kick the chair which could have been on rust in peace , the scorpion another return to form , and back in the day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album . i would n't put this up there with rust in peace or countdown , but i certainly would put this up there with so far so good or youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums , and put 's it into one . if your a new fan and just getting into megadeth this is n't a bad place to start . certainly a must have , and am looking forward to the brand new album next year . long live mega-dave
0	out of all of the early '90s , l.a. gangster flicks , this one probably had the best set of chicano oldie tracks . the movie was laced with them , yet none are on the soundtrack . kind of a waste . sure , you can get those oldies anywhere . but it would be nice to have those songs from this movie on one cd . again , it was a good sequence they used . aside from that ; it 's okay , i guess , if you 're a fan of b-list l.a. chicano rappers . but , even if you are , you can get better music from their respective albums . lsob 's first cd from '91 was tight . if you have that , then you 're really not missing anything by letting the 'loca ' soundtrack pass .
0	the music for the soundtrack was so lame ! i though i was gon na cry cause i figured this was the end of b2k by this point . the s'track was n't even all b2k either . i like the song with jhene and omarion `` happy '' . also i liked `` out of the hood '' other then that it was boring .
1	but a good debut album . this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny . no radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part . but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you ca n't keep talkin about it , which is why i guess he changed his style . now the subject i wan na hit . has anyone noticed that guy named progressive ? why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture ? and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie . last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music . i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock . i 'm tired of our music bein trashed . you know what im a go trash one of they `` artist '' right now
0	deep lyrics man , i 'm getting a lot out of this ... but just wait for the next record when you 'll get `` hold on loosely !
1	i am not jewish , but you do n't have to be to enjoy these songs . this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases . a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album . each and every song on here is wonderful ... some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions . the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music , and each artist has a page about them , including a photograph . i highly recommend this album to just about everyone . my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs . music truly is borderless
0	camera obscura is similar , in an inferior manner , to nico , of the velvet underground nico . the band makes pleasantly dull `` chamber pop '' in the vein of belle sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years . even their name is ripped off of nico 's last studio album , camera obscura . but , as i said before , camera obscura is much worse than nico . if you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like , pick up `` chelsea girl , '' nico 's first solo album
0	the worst christmas album i ever heard . i just bought it , played it once , and will never play it again
1	together with 'the best of kool & amp ; the gang ' ... .. t h i s is the ultimate bit of funk that i 've found so far . the tracks may not always have a `` song structure '' ( and for me the women singers may be omitted.. ) - the funkiest bits in history are found here ! ! ! ! ! !
0	disappointing to see a man of garbarek 's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of mor classical and soft world-beat markets . no one expects him to do a 'jazz ' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses . sadly , the evidence on this release is of an artist who 's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion ; theres nothing here he has n't said better on his previous three or four outings . all is not lost though , and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or tv documentary about some beautiful natural environment . forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and i guarantee you 'll feel better for it
0	stinkish-i totally agree with you 100 % ! ! ! ! what was mattel thinking when they released this item ? some songs are ok , but `` hit me baby one more time ? '' that song is soooo old ! and so yesterday , by lip singer , hilary duff , is sooooo yesterday ! ! ! ! you got ta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it.if you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review
0	there 's a reason oar flopped when it was released back in 1969 : it sucks . thirty eight years later , with skip spence safely in his grave , some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars . since you ca n't give more than five stars here , they 're saying oar is on a level with masterpieces like sergeant pepper ... dark side of the moon ... led zeppelin 4 ... . ! just between you and me , i think the government is still secretly drugging people . with all due respect to skip 's venerable memory , oar is a painful aural experience . the first two tracks , little hands and cripple creek , are halfway good , and show some production values ; but things quickly deteriorate from there . one gets the impression the rest of oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes . lastly , the bass playing and drumming are just awful . yes , it 's too bad that things ended up like they did for skip . and it 's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard . but let 's keep a sense of perspective : his tragedy did not translate into good music . one extra star in his memory .
1	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith . there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others . a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's `` swanee '' and `` rock-a-bye , '' although every track is just excellent . the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great . i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby
1	ministry of sound has always had the reputation of putting out the best music . they have a way of findind the best dj 's , artists , producers and remixers from the 4 corners of the earth and bringing them to us on a cd . this cd is no exception . soothing beats without lacking in tempo or energy , this cd could literally be enjoyed by a cowbow from kentucky . it 's just that palattable
0	lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort . i 'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from `` amazed '' syndrome . amazed 's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album , their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad . did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville ? i 'm already there comes off as very diane warren-ish in its sappy lyrics . their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay , but these songs do n't work for them . these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this .
0	he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness , perseverance and dreams of ordinary people . in `` sandra '' for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour . the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique . in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions . he released a few inspired tracks now and then , his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth , and `` here at the mayflower '' was a sincere effort . he is an intelligent person who cares for music and does n't let his superstardom go to his head . so , what has changed ? and why this late in his career ? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer , liberace style . and he 's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens . i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy , like liberace did . and i have deep respect for that . but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that does n't really have any demands .
0	i am wondering when this plague will be over ... . and when we 'll be set free to listen to real music ... we all are so tired of her
1	along with son volt 's `` trace '' and nadine 's `` downtown saturday , '' this is one of the best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best alt.country albums ever released . standout tracks include `` blue canoe , '' `` soul sister , '' `` eyes of a child , '' `` wink '' and `` let 's go runnin ' '' all examples of first class rock songwriting . the rest ai n't too shabby either . fans of the allman brothers and lynyrd skynyrd in particular should give this mississippi band a listen . but so should any mainstream rock fan
1	sidney bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz . burns puts together a great combination of early recordings . jazz historions note bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with louis armstrong . you have to include bechet in your jazz collection , and this one is as good as any
0	shannon lawson is capable of a much better album . i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots , and it was amazing ! if they were to put out a cd i 'm sure it would be one of my favorites . shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that 's what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd . instead they gave it this generic , overproduced sound , leaving shannon sound like everyone else . with the way bluegrass is selling these days , it 's a shame that shannon could n't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..
0	i ususally like aguilera and i need a song to practice for dance so i bought this one for `` no other man '' figuring i would like the other songs as well . i was so wrong . i hate the rest of them .
1	herb alpert has done what few artists can do . he 's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original . i love the original `` whipped cream '' , but this cd is a masterstroke . combining alpert 's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing , but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end . unlike some of the purists , i loved this cd and you will too
0	golijov 's music incorporates jewish , arabic , christian , afro-brazilian , and other ethnic influences ad nauseum ... so what ? listening to this disc is like having dental work done without novocaine . only diversity nazis who want to smugly bask in their own `` enlightened '' weltanschauung will find much to enjoy here . golijov cunningly caters to these folks ' taste . may he ride it all the way to the bank .
0	this is nothing like the classic dead you 've heard about . far from it . the sound is too polished . `` alabama get away '' and `` althea '' are okay but the rest is junk . i think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the deads ' best music . really ... the grateful dead with a polished sound ? ? just does n't seem to fit . save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations , plus american beauty , worjing man 's dead , europe '72 and `` dead set ''
0	she does n't sing ... she yells ! ! ! and using one of ednita 's songs as she did with `` lo que son las cosas '' is just sacrilege at its `` best '' ( or worst ) . it 's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself . she has absolutely nothing on beyonce or cristina aguilera . her cd is just plain bad ! if you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices ( and that actually sing ) , you might want to look for la lupe , celia cruz , ednita nazario and lucecita benitez ... and these are only the ones i remembered at the moment
1	if this is to truly be gybe 's last piece of work , then they 've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note . while i still believe `` lift yr . skinny fists ... '' is their masterwork , `` yanqui '' is easily a close second . where `` fists '' had a broader range of sounds and textures - elements of sacred and profane - `` yanqui '' is more balanced and focused . although you could argue this point , i think `` yanqui '' never gets as high or low as `` fists . '' the sound on `` yanqui '' is entirely consistent with their previous releases . as other reviewers mentioned , the only major change is the absence of field recordings , which actually helps to distinguish this album as the finale . the lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery to the work . well , there is actually another surprising moment on this album : it happens during a movement about halfway into the album . the guitars drop off , leaving only a small ensemble playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion . for a few minutes it definitely does n't sound like typical gybe . in fact , the dissonant horns sound almost like a ligeti composition ( although ligeti probably would n't have used a steady rhythm of any kind ) . fear not . not only does it work , but it swells nicely into a full band tidal wave . but here 's the most important point i want to make about yanqui : to me , it resolves some of the musical themes `` fists '' introduced , which makes u.x.o . a fitting conclusion . the last bit on `` mfer=redeemer p.1 '' slows way down , featuring one guitar with one violin ( i think ) playing together in fragile harmony , along with some distortion in the background . when i listen to this , i ca n't help but think of the very beginning of `` fists , '' except the melody changes just enough to resolve the paranoia that the `` fists '' melody introduced . in other words , it 's like i can hear gybe - at last - acknowledging that there does exist some ... hope ! ... some goodness ! ... .some peace ! ... in this world - the very place that 's inspired them to make such dissonant music . and , well , if gybe can slow down and acknowledge something hopeful exists , well then , hope must exist . indeed , mother****er does = redeemer . of course , they give us one last act on `` yanqui '' just to kick our butts one final time . yes , it gets so out of control that , at one point , the siren that 's blaring in the background seems appropriate . the very end , i love , as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and droning until the music finally -- it suddenly ends . `` yanqui u.x.o . '' is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant catalog . it 's an awesome finale
1	i just loved this album the songs really related to my life . it was nice to see that there was personal experience involved while writing the songs
1	this is a difficult album to review . people either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced , overblown waste of their time . however , i can say that this is my favorite oasis album . why ? that 's a very good question ... maybe because be here now was my introduction to oasis , and i could tell that this band had a lot to offer , even through the drug-addled , overproduced songs that seemed to last forever . each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it , two characteristics of most oasis songs . it 's no use comparing be here now to morning glory or def . maybe , because it 's in a whole other ballpark . this is oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit . no doubt that all the coke helped with that . it 's my firm belief that morning glory and def . maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights . be here now is just something else , you either love it or hate it . it has it 's own little oasis category . i can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors . there are some valid complaints about this album , though . one , it is very very overproduced , filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else . unfortunately , this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long . two , the songs are astonishingly long at times . all around the world , while an excellent song , clocks in at around 9:20 . i believe that the shortest song is i hope , i think , i know , coming in at 4:23 . so you know you 're in for a long , wild ride . however , only oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable . all the arrogance , coke , and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people . and of course , there 's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : `` the beatles are quite good , but oasis is much better . '' and so a resounding yes to all of these : overproduced , arrogant , drug-induced , staggering , amazing , excellent . i do n't care about the negative things , though , because that 's what makes be here now a sucess in its own right .
0	someone get this band a producer and put them in a decent studio , please . the recording and mixing on this disc is flat-out atrocious . download a few tracks and hear for yourself . 'feburary ' and '99 with an anchor ' show promise . otherwise it 's taking back sunday meets hawthorn heights meets fallout boy meets ... . you get the picture
0	it 's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album . mother mother definitly rips of stairway to heaven from stairway 's ending vocals riff . ( and as we wind on down the road.. ) does she give zep credit on that ? now that rockstar supernova has used the song twice it has brought mother , mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me . good female yell and complain song but i just ca n't get past that riff rip
0	the people who have mentioned aphex twin and four tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists . if you liked the stone roses you will like this . it 's not an 'electronic ' album at all . i 've ordered manitoba 's earlier cd after listening to the samples ( the reason for purchasing both these albums ) and i certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'up in flames ' . it 's funny , i promised myself i would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading , either that or dan snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years
1	this is their best studio album . what more can i say ? brokedown palace may be the most beautiful rock song of all time . a must
1	we started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town . as babies sometimes do , she began screaming and was unconsolable ... until we turned on rocket ship beach . polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so . we played that song at least 6 times in a row that day ! now that she 's a little older , she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing , requesting her cd be played . i 've always enjoyed a wide range of music , and was afraid that after having a child , we 'd be reduced to listening to watered down `` kid music '' like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys . there is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time . there is a good variety of instrumentation and styles . our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about . got kids ? buy this cd !
1	ca n't really add much to the reviews . this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older . i 'll admit that when this came out in '94 , i only bumped the singles . it did n't grab me at the time . sometime around '97 i gave it a spin and i 've been loving it ever since . there are plenty of bangers on the album , but classics like `` pour out a little liquor '' , `` str8 ballin ' `` , `` how long will they mourn me '' , cradle to the grave '' , and `` under pressure '' make this album worth owning all by themselves . the rest of the songs are on point too -- there is n't much filler on this album . the production is handled by warren g. nate dogg ( 1 ) , the awesone yet underrated easy mo b ( 1 ) , johnny j ( 1 ) , jay mopreme ( 1 ) , jay syke ( 1 ) , stretch ( 1 ) , and thug music ( 4 ) . i 'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks . the only tracks that i would call skip material are `` sh** do n't stop '' and `` do n't get it twisted '' . `` sh** do n't stop '' is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive . the production is on `` do n't get it twisted '' cool , but it 's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it ( in my opinion ) . volume 1 is a passionate , if at times misdirected , release from the thug life camp . the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 's cali vibes . it holds up very well 13 years after its release . of course , if you 're a tupac completist , you probably have this album already . but even if you 're not a pac fan , this should be a part of your collection . r.i.p . tupac standout tracks : how long will they mourn me feat . nate dogg , pour out a little liquor , str8 ballin ' ( my favorite ) , cradle to the grave , under pressure , bury me a g feat . natasha walker ( of y.n.v . )
0	oh man , this sucks really bad . good thing nu-metal is dead . thrash metal is real metal , this is for posers
0	following on from the fantastic 'the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release 'getting somewhere ' is a massive , massive disappointment . quite simply the material on 'getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless . on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'the duel ' - such as on hallelujah new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish , pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long , hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around . if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job . moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately

1	their 4th album as a complete group ( not counting the few album havoc prode'je put out ) is my least favorite of the 4 scc albums i have ( i do n't have the one from 1992 or 2005 ) , but it still gets itself a 4 star rating . out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping ; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good . like all their albums , guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs . production is mostly handled by prode'je ( as with all their albums ) he does get a little help from robert `` fonksta '' bacon tomie mundie . a good album to have for scc fans but not their best work . # 1 - 8 # 2 - 8 # 3 - 7.5 # 4 - 7.5 # 5 - 7 # 6 - 8 # 7 - 8.5 ( f/ c-bo , spice 1 , prophet -- -- also on their `` gangsta conversation '' album ) # 8 - 9 ( f/ daz dillinger -- - good beat ) # 9 - 8 # 10 - 9 ( good beat , deeper song -- my favorite on here ) # 11 - 8 # 12 - 8 ( another deeper song ) # 13 - 7.5 scc is -- - havikk , prode'je , havoc , l.v. , dj gripp , dj kaos check all my review
1	brilliant , glorious music -- all of it , although i agree with those who have come to feel that the ellington/strayhorn version of `` the nutcracker suite , '' in particular , is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no christmas season should be without ( and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year , you have more willpower than i ) . what happens to tchaikovsky 's marvellous music -- and grieg 's , too -- in these hands is creative homage of the highest order : the music is re-imagined from the inside , in wholly jazz terms , in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original . what balanchine did for tchaikovsky and stravinsky in dance , ellington here does for tchaikovsky and grieg in another realm of music , and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes . and to top it all off , you get ellington and strayhorn 's own superb `` suite thursday . '' listen and rejoice
0	when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove , there was no better sounding group than qms . cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring . unfortunately , one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure . without cipollina , qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group , despite the talents of duncan , freiberg and elmore . i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.if you want to hear them at their best , buy the 1st album , happy trails , or lost gold and silver
1	originally released in 1972 , this was can 's fourth record as well as their follow-up to 'tago mago ' ( see my review ) .some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in ( might take several spins ) are `` pinch '' , liked michael karoli 's ( r.i.p . ) stellar guitar solos , the somewhat stunning `` vitamin c '' and this reissue 's lengthiest track , the ten-minute `` soup '' .first rate german progressive kraut.after i listened to this cd a second time , i realized that 'ege bamyasi ' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like gary numan , pere ubu , public image ltd. and stereolab.silly cover , do n't you agree
0	i saw this movie 'cause i was interested to see cathy rigby , `` who was born to play peter pan '' . i hated it a lot . so , now i am in a high school production of peter pan , and i happend to see the mary martin version , and the mary martain cd . i loved it ! then i realized that 'peter pan ' is not a bad musical at all . cathy rigby and the `` crew '' were making it bad . i have no idea why they think cathy rigby is the greatest thing since sliced bread . do n't believe them . she is n't . she sounded like she was a stuiped little brat that just wanted to rot the rest of his [ her ] time just sitting in a dark corner carving forks while on the other hand , mary martain sounds all cheerful , fun , and real . i reccomend mary martain 's video and cd . i say no more
1	this cd is really really good . warped tour never fails to please . the best songs are by these people ... the used , yellowcard , story of the year , matchbook romance , the early november , avoid one thing , taking back sunday , audio karate , simple plan , maxeen , coheed and cambria , and mest . buy this c
1	any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission . these pieces , each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem , remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for `` new age '' . sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web ... it 's `` feel good '' music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor
1	sometimes , debut albums present an artist in full bloom , with an assured grasp on their sound and message . sometimes , debut albums are nothing but promise , pointing toward what the artist could do . public enemy 's gripping first album , yo ! bum rush the show , manages to fill both categories : it 's an expert , fully realized record of extraordinary power , but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later . this is very much a rick rubin-directed production , kicking heavy guitars toward the front , honing the loops , rhythms , and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap . but , damn if they do n't sound like they 've already conquered the world ! already , there is a tangible , physical excitement to the music , something that hits the gut with relentless force , as the mind races to keep up with chuck 's relentless rhymes or flavor flav 's spastic outbursts . and if there does n't seem to be as many classics here -- `` you 're gon na get yours , '' `` miuzi weighs a ton , '' `` public enemy no . 1 '' -- that 's only in comparison to what came later , since by any other artist an album this furious , visceral , and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic . from public enemy , this is simply a shade under classic status
1	just wanted to answer reviewer : '' homedecaramel '' and his question as to who melissa refers to from the song titled ' `` melissa 's garden '' . melissa was the daughter of close friends of steve vai . she passed away 5 years ago at a fairly young age due to ovarian cancer . melissa 's parents built a beautiful garden as a remembrance of her . melissa had a wonderful spirit and her spirit lives on as is apparent in steve 's beautiful tribute and in melissa 's garden .
0	this album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky , wacky , vivid personality of the first three galactic studio albums -- this is boring , flat and generic . is that stanton moore or a drum machine ? precede straight to garage a trois
0	dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer . unfortunately , the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts , songs that seem formulaic and `` safe . '' his best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them . they 'll never make it to the pop airwaves . serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd . `` greatest hits '' is not synonymous with `` greatest music .
0	this is a saccharine and banal take on irish music , with all the emotional intesity of a hummel figuraine . upon first listen , i remarked to my wife that they sounded more like peter , paul , and mary than the dubliners . she correctly pointed out that peter , paul , and mary were actually much better than this pablum , and that the irish rovers more closely resemble the fictional main street singers from a mighty wind . truly , absolutely , unlistenably passionless , cloying and bland
1	i have just purchased this cd ( the day it came out ! ) and from what i 've heard , it is amazing , surpassing ( but not replacing ) boulez 's earlier recording . if you are a fan of boulez , 20th century music , or music in general , this is a must get
0	i ca n't believe the touch of b.b . king . i enjoy his playing immensely . i know this album gets buried in accolades . but i do n't like it . the quality is poor and , differing from other 's opinions , the crowd noise takes away from the music . b.b . said , in so many words , that live at the regal was far from his choice as his best recording . typically , he said he would n't argue with success -- and left it at that . there are so many good albums by b.b . you ca n't go wrong for $ 4.65 for the `` ultimate collection '' . sure it does n't have them all -- but it has quite a few of his great songs , including a few from live at the regal . i would steer clear of this selection . or i 'll send you mine for free
0	a lot of people are meriting ja 's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998 . so he released his sophomore album rule 3:36 in sept 2000 , that is one of the worst ja albums i 've heard ( not the worst , the last temptation takes that title ) . ja tries to be `` gangstafied '' on this album but fails terribly . starting with the first single `` me you '' thinking his thug style can attract women . i have n't bought the concept in 2000 , and i 'm still not buying it six years later . or how about the flat falling track `` f*** you '' featuring vita and 01 ? or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album , which seriously damages his creditablity . how about the song `` put it on me '' before lil mo joined song . sounds wack ( er ) with out her . or how about the late barry white imitation on the song `` extacy '' ( and thats one of the decent tracks on this album ) . oh and remember when `` between me you '' was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on napster ? well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded did n't have christina millian singing the hook , but had ja singing it himself . thank god that was n't on the album . now there are some listenable tracks on this album that i would like to point out . `` 6 feet '' is a standout track , and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite . `` watching me '' is another tight track , as ja spits with a load of energy within him . `` i cry '' and as mentioned earlier `` extacy '' are decent at best . other than that , most of the tracks on this album are skippable . overall , a sub medicore ja rule album . most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time ja rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ( `` put it on me '' [ remix ] ) . to me , this album is nothing else but a pop rap , falsafied thug rap album that just does n't appeal to me . i recommend this to hardcore ja rule fans if they do n't have this already . lyrics : c production : c+ guest appearances : c- musical vibes : d- favorite tracks : watching me , 6 feet , die , extacy honorable mention track : chris black ( skit
0	i 've never written a review , but i just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot , and you 're killing hip-hop . stop killing my music
0	do yourself a favor and only buy his albums . they 're much more solid . one love . peace
1	top to bottom this album has it all - makes you laugh , makes you think , makes you want to dance . i ca n't wait till mainstream finally catches up and the music industry finally recognizes what a gift todd snider is and the talent he posseses . his music will inspire you to move something whether it 's your brain or your bottom ! check him out
0	i 've listened to this piece of work several times , in many positions , on various stero systems , during different moods and i just ca n't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud ' . it is n't a question of country music , or contemporary music , with elh she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves , and respects , good music . the music is good , the woman has impeccable taste but this time i had wished she sat in on the mixing process . i think i understand the aim of this collection but geez , i wish i did n't . i am too accustomed to hearing elh 's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics , take them and present them with a totally unique perspective . i wo n't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft . she 's an amazing woman , artist and collaborator -- i love her because she is everywhere in music : supporting new artists , doing background for others , her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists , while always doing what 's best for the song . i just hope there 's no follow up to wb . i 'm very happy with my other 8 elh cds and i 'm in awe of 'all roads running ' and my [ ... ] is going to be front center next week in los angeles . it 's like waiting for xmas
1	this was one of those rare performances where dylan 's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great . the sound is rough , the intonation is off , the recording is filled with horrible buzzes , whistles , and clicks . none of which matters . once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk , you 'll prefer them to the original album cuts . i know i do . absolutely essential to any collection of dylan 's work , `` hard rain '' is not to be missed .
0	paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music . however , content on his latest project , `` white sand '' is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums . the artist collaborations on `` white sand '' make it tempting to purchase , but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility ( smooth , latin or r ) are lacking . overall it is still a cd worth paying for
1	this is by far the best psychopathic album ever released . riddlebox is now in second place . madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album . beats are bangin ' and lyrics are flawless ! great flows and he mixes funny with wicked . best songs are this b*tch and hey phatty . great album by the best rapper of our time . madrox is so under rated . i wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process . buy this album , best rap album ever made
0	eight years ago today was the day blondie 's reunion album was released , and though it was great to see blondie back together , no exit just fell short on many levels . 2004 's the curse of blondie ( see my review also on amazon ) is a much better album and should have been their comeback . no exit wo n't exactly take you back to the hooks that made blondie famous . harry 's lyrics are wonderful in `` double take , '' but the deadpan melody literally kills the song . fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards ( `` boom boom in the zoom zoom room '' ) or revamped demo tracks ( `` out in the streets '' ) , but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by coolio . both the band and coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about . the music is n't catchy either . all is not lost with songs like `` night wind sent , '' and harry 's own transformation in `` forgive and forget , plus who would dare argue blondie 's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear `` maria . '' as the album 's best track , `` maria '' is a wonderful reminder of how blondie , and debbie , can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind
1	this is their best album.easily better than anything the likes of oasis ever managed.richard iii , going out , late in the day and the title track are all top quality.if you rated blurs 3 `` britpop '' ( horrible term really ) albums from the 90s then get this.its up there with them.simple as that
1	great anniversary present . fav song ... i love the way you love me ... my husband loves to listen to it in the car
0	their new stuff is even worse . but this is still sexist , boring , annoying music at its worst . there are much better artists out there , so why listen to these two untalented rappers
1	immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon-like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin . if you like cajun music - this is for you . if you like western swing - this is for you . if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant - then this is for you ! classical ? jazz ? blues ? country rock ? then yeah - you guessed it - this is for you ! this is an absolutely fantastic album - a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today 's greatest violinists . pure genius
0	all of the songs are boring . i hate them . they are slow and boring and they make you want to fall asleep
0	man , can she get anymore stupid and talentless . she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits . all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power , vocal range and versatility . jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today . she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career . just because your a great actor/actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing , too . some actors/actresses were able to achieve it , but not jennifer lopez . she needs to quit the music business while she still can . please stick to acting ... oh , wait ! i forgot , she ca n't do that either !
1	la bamba ( 1987 . ) the soundtrack to the ritchie valens biopic of the same name . introduction : in 1987 , the film la bamba , based on the life and times of fifties pop-rock star ritchie valens , was released . the film cast lou diamond phillips as the classic musician , and told his story , from his rise to fame , right down to his young and tragic death . for the film , los lobos , a fairly popular act of the day , was asked to rerecord classic valens material for the movie . some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film . so , how is the soundtrack ? read on , and find out ! overview : the la bamba soundtrack was released in 1987 , around the same time as the film of the same name . contributors to the soundtrack include los lobos , howard huntsberry , marshall crenshaw , brian setzer , and bo diddley . the a-side of the soundtrack sonsists of the los lobos covers of the ritchie valens songs la bamba , come on lets go , ooh my head , we belong together , framed , and donna . the b-side consists of the other artists ' covers , which include howard huntsberry 's cover of jackie wilson 's lonely teardrops , marshall crenshaw 's cover of buddy holly 's crying waiting hoping , brian setzer 's cover of eddie cochran 's summertime blues , bo diddley 's remake of his own classic tune who do you love , and the two songs los lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes , charlena and goodnight my love . review : awesome movie , awesome soundtrack . i 'm a huge fan of the music of ritchie valens , and for the most part , la bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the valens saga . aside from some omitted material ( which i 'll get to later ) , the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents . read on for my reviews of the tracks . -side a- -la bamba by los lobos : los lobos covers the track that took ritchie valens to the top of the musical world . being a folk song , no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - valens proved the non-believers wrong ! los lobos does a great cover of it , too . the band actually did two versions of the song for the movie - a rendition of the slower , folksier version by the bar band that convinced valens to cover the song himself , as well as the classic version valens did . this is the classic valens version . i wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack , though ( although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version does reprise elements of the folk-type version . still , i wanted both versions as complete , separate tracks ! ) -come on lets go by los lobos : this classic rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for ritchie valens . los lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut , staying true to the valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things . all in all , another great song . -ooh my head by los lobos : not much to say about this one . once again , los lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic valens tunes people know and love him for . every song on this soundtrack is excellent , and this one is no exception . -we belong together by los lobos : ah , the classic valens love song . although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad donna , this one was still a fairly notable hit for valens . the los lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but i should n't have to tell you that , now should i ? -framed by los lobos : of all of the ritchie valens song that los lobos revisited in la bamba , this one is the least well known . that 's a shame , because it 's a great song ! the song takes a classic blues styling , and puts a rockabilly spin on it . once again , los lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song . -donna by los lobos : this song was so big a hit for ritchie valens initially , that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is la bamba . the classic ode valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time . and i know you 're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song , but los lobos really does a good job on here . -side b- -lonely teardrops by howard huntsberry : in la bamba , howard huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer jackie wilson . and here , huntsberry reprises wilson 's signature tune . this is classic soul at its very best . prior to seeing la bamba , i had never even heard of huntsberry . but the real shocker is that i ended up liking this version of the song more than the original ! definitely a solid , underrated cut . -crying waiting hoping by marshall crenshaw : marshall crenshaw , a fairly popular eighties pop signer , managed to land the role of buddy holly in la bamba . holly , of course , was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of ritchie valens . buddy holly is a tough guy to cover , but marshall crenshaw does a damn good job of it . i personally prefer this version over holly 's original ( and that 's saying a lot since i love buddy holly ! ) if you 're interested in hearing crenshaw cover another holly tune , check out the remastered version of his 1982 self-titled debut - he covers rave on on there as a bonus track . -summertime blues by brian setzer : long before brian setzer gained any real fame , he played eddie cochran in la bamba , covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend . here 's another one of those covers that is so good , i like it more than the original . definitely worthwhile listening - but then again , is n't every song on here ? -who do you love by bo diddley : bo diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago , and was asked to rerecord it for la bamba . he did , and the end results are solid . diddley is a legend of the blues , and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way . it just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the george thorogood one , because diddley 's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard . -charlena by los lobos : in addition to the ritchie valens covers , los lobos recorded two new songs for the la bamba soundtrack . this is the first of the two . essentially , this here is a neo-rockabilly track of sorts , and a damn good one too . long after the fifties music scene died out , los lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly . -goodnight my love by los lobos : here 's the second of the newly-recorded los lobos songs done for the soundtrack . what we have here is one of those classic fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then . if you 're into that sort of thing , you 're going to love this song - i know i do ! -other comments- omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack , by far . as i previously stated , only one version of la bamba is on here - not both versions from the film . another omission is sleepwalk , the classic santo and johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film . its omission is likely due to the fact that it was n't recorded just for the film , but still , i miss it . and then there 's the issue of rip it up , the classic ritchie valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage , early on in the film . this was one of my favorite songs in the film , and i was devastated not to see it on here . and where 's the big bopper 's chantilly lace ? i rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions . if these songs had been on here , it would be five stars all the way . overall : overall , despite my issues with the omitted songs , i am very satisfied with the la bamba soundtrack . much like the movie , it 's an excellent experience all the way through . if you liked the movie , or you 're just into this sort of music , the soundtrack is well worth owning . highly recommended ! edition notes : this soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc , implying it may be very gradually going out of print . take my advice - if you want it , just buy it online . it 's the fastest , easiest way to get it .

0	she is not a singer , she is not able to write , play and read the scores/music . she is an entertainer ! the problem is : you ca n't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today . who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years ? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls ! ps : pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos ! ! ! thank god for america 's future pop artists like this one !
1	in this cd laura pausini performs songs from a variety of italian singer-songwriters . she ads her personal touch to all of them , of course . the results are lovely and inspired . a lot of the songs already had versions in castellano , but laura and her team have written new spanish lyrics to some of them . all of these songs were made famous by their creators . most of the songs are ballads , but there are some midtempo tracks in the title track , `` dos '' ( due , by raf ) and `` estrella gemela '' ( by eros ramazzotti ) , and danceable pop in `` mi banda toca rock . '' i do n't know about the comment from the reviewers below about `` mi banda toca rock '' as menudo song ( a horrible thought to some of us ! ) , but the original italian version was fun . it 's not a bubblegum song , but about the combination of traditional latin music ( latin in the original sense , all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers ) and rock music , something that was starting to happen when the song was written . this reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in english . i believe they are wrong about the song . `` estrella gemela '' has some sections in english , but that is the way it was originally written and performed by eros ramazzotti ( in italian and spanish ) , to emphasize the influence of african-american gospel music in the song . laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song . all in all , this is a great album , so give it a shot . whether you speak the language or not , the italian version of the album is even better . laura just keeps getting better with time ! laura sei bravissima
1	this cd reminds me once again why russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world : beautiful , profound , awe-inspiring , uplifting . for the most part , the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent . i am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the rachmaninoff vespers made in the early 1970s by the ussr ministry of culture chamber choir directed by valery polyansky , and released in the usa by angel-melodiya . i wore out my copy of the lp years ago ; although it has been reissued on cd , it 's out of print and very hard to find . so it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk . listen to track 11 , `` praise the lord o my soul '' , sung by the chamber choir and mezzo irina arkhipova . you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings `` slava ghospidin '' ( praise to the lord ) . and listen to how the basses descend to b-flat at end . it just does n't get any better than this
0	with the exception of `` my heart will go on '' by celine dion , horner 's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers . for a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film . overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it . this was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic , awful event . it did n't stop them though ; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water . overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year
1	if you like music you ca n't help but like mariachi from mexico . it is superb . is there another volume ? if so , tell me about it
0	ok , at long last public enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average , non-innovative , non-avent guard , dj 's mix there stuff up . even dj spookie 's mix was not that grand . everything sounds like beats that i discovered in the early 90 's . on the other hand , this album is only a couple bucks used , so i would highly highly highly suggest buying it if only for 54321 boom which is perhaps one of the best pe tracks ever to come out ! not only are the beats right on , but the lyrics are some of the hardest i 've heard yet ! and for the note , my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound . infact i love the new pe ( whirl odor ) even though it has club friendly sounds , mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats ( they are very multi-layered ) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder , and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world ( lyness )
1	this is without doubt the most beautiful , moving song i have ever heard . i cry every time i listen to it . i will ask my family to have it played at my funeral . the lyrics and symbolism are born of emotional genius . the solo vocalist and the instrumentation are flawless . this selection is the hope diamond of contemporary music
0	the problem with america was that started out great . the first album was fresh and different from everything . three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own . `` horse with no name '' and `` sandman '' , was what pave the way for them . the problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop . they should of left `` muskrat love . '' to the captain and tennille . this album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end . the problem was that there was their first two albums , ( america and venture highway ) and there was their others . my recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans
0	i do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album . there is nothing new or 'fresh ' or 'original ' or at all thought-brovoking about this music , unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound . i have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music , but i was introduced to it through artists like arab on radar and scissor girls . so when i tried out my first sonic youth album , i was way more than dissapointed . i do n't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore . sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word , but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band . the most notable anything is the catchy medlody of becuz . it is really catchy , yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical `` catchy tunes '' ethos . xiu xiu 's `` knife play '' would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave ... and still retain the emotional pop sinsibility . i do n't know.. all i know is that wasing machine is a letdown . it does not reach me artistically by a long shot . emotionally , i can think of am million other artists ( mars volta , emerson lake palmer , clouddead , ulver , edvard greig ! ) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition . this however is far to cheezy , and i do n't know , but i think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..
1	this is a great cd . back where i come from , is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time i here it . chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song . i recommend all his albums
1	this mos def album is a good album to listen to . he shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point . why listen to a bunch of guys who have `` lil '' in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life , love , and this country we live i
0	listening to this c.d . first gave me a headache , then it made my stomache churn . it is so uninspired , it 's not even funny ( or listenable ) . yeah , it 's loud , but i can be loud , too , if i had some pots and pans and a `` guitar . '' do n't get this , it 's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l
0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band , and the horrible more than a feeling . they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica 's 4th lp today . get and justice for all by metallica insted
1	these 3 discs ( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! ) are a continuation of live dead . if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead . you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band . the playing , the interplay between the musicians - particularly garcia and lesh is staggering . and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums
0	i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel 's the stranger at the same time . after listening to the stranger , my mouth dropped . billy 's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction . then i put in boston and could n't tell a difference from the cd version i already own . i think it 's one of the best albums , but if you already own it on cd , do n't bother upgrading - there 's nothing special about the sacd version
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
1	this cd has tons of power , and soothing energy . it really shows off how well part understands the human voice
1	rien a dire si ce n'est que too $ hort et ses potes ça claque c'est tout
0	being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times ... this cd has nothing new to offer . there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past 10 years . what 's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover ? nothing . i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time . been there . done that . bored to tears
1	its just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like hard to earn anymore ... gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
0	the lack of someone lurking behind prince 's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team . this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster . musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed . while prince fans will generally hype this track , the reality is that `` 4 the tears in your eyes '' this is n't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass . lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121 .
1	anais is one of the best cingers . i have seen her since objetivo fama , and she is just great . do n't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating . this cd is just great
1	i have to admit that , at first listening , i found some aspects of ms.belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting . however , as i listened to these covers repeatedly , i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after . not that i always agree with her and with george duke , the arranger/producer , but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened . ms.belle has immense talent , superb technique , and a clear idea of each piece , and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise . i admire that a lot in a performer . her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i was quite stand-offish , but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way , they are waiting for our reaction..and god , this is really so , so good ... .that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded . i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong , powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina . you may love everything about it , or you may reject aspects of her interpretations . but in any case you will not remain indifferent ; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way . that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable . and it can not be said enough that her backing band is incredible , giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge . it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized . regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve of ... only time will tell ... .
1	i just purchased this album , my first misfits album and every song on it rocks ( i especially like where eagles dare ) . i just bought two more albums , walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait . my only complain is the sound quality . it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking ... but i guess that makes it sound more real too . metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same .
0	this whole post crap grunge is crap . if you want real rock check out gnr , acdc , and any band pre grunge . i know this is a review but how does this grab ya . oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom . `` oh how did we wind up like this ? '' exactly what i 'm trying to figure out . tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break
0	if any kid music annoys you , this cd is not for you . these are good old classic songs , but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs . i 'm throwing it away . i want my two-year-old to know the songs i know and love , but this was a bad buy on my part .
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am , i really do n't care much for this album . i say thank goodness for `` creep '' because we may have never heard from them again ( or at least not in the same way ) if that song had not become as popular as it did
0	i loved shedaisy 's first album the whole shebang . and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn . they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with . i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed . this is a very dark and depressing album . almost every song is about lost love . also , all the songs but 1 are slow . where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with ? ? ? i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again . still , i look forward to what the future may bring from them . these sisters have alot of talent
1	the soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it . overall it is a good produc
0	carter burwell 's soundtrack music to `` rob roy '' was an early sign that he was not just getting it right . the score is all wrong but so is the movie . this movie needed an uplifting score . carter burwell could not deliver it
1	i got ta be honest , when i first listened to this album i was dissapointed . but like any truly amazing album , it just took some decoding , listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing . essentially , gat are four people who are amazing at what they do , and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly . their first album , emphasizer , blew me away , but i felt it lost steam around halfway through . this album does no such thing , and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album , which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for . this gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department . but dont get me wrong , this cd sounds amazing . anyway , i saw them live last night in nyc , and they blew my mind ... i recommend this cd to anyone , and see them live if you get the rare opportunity !
1	as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i 've followed for some time . not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . there are superb performances all round , vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady , maura o'connell , kathhy mattea , del mccoury etc and musicians altan , frankie gavin , jerry douglas , earl scruggs , seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no production gimmicks or effects . standout songs for me personally are `` mountaineer is always free '' , `` lost little children '' , `` wandering '' and `` john riley '' although there is not a weak track on the cd . it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love . if you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the atlantic , you 'll love it . several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant
0	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album , i expected a hard hitting original . instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of `` filler '' salsa . no surprises here . the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious , you 'll play this one once
1	the title gets it right - this is a very fun album . there are a lot of great songs on here . infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is . one other thing ... it 's a sin that `` we 're the same '' was n't a bigger hit than it was . truly a great song
1	this disc dates from monk 's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia . so it 's valuable from that point of view . it 's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it . the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk , which many consider the definitive version , and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo , which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco . sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein . much of the rest of the album has a forceful , driving quality , with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for monk . a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd . have some of the songs as performed by other artists , but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer . i 'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity .
0	just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like `` they rock '' or `` the lead singer is soooo hot '' are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music
1	... else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now . illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens , and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date . however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite . perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois , but more soulful and beautiful . ultimately it 's the one i 'd take to the proverbial desert island . there 's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i 'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist , but highlights for me are romulus ( gentle and heartbreaking ) , sleeping bear ( musically gorgeous ) , and vito 's ordination song ( like being gently hugged ) . p.s . so often the 'bonus tracks ' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd ( marching band and pickerel lake ) are both excellent .
0	i like meav 's voice , and this cd is ok , if you like this kind of stuff . think slow and somewhat depressing . i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times , and came up with this vocal sound , i guess to hark back to earlier times , which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music . this is all a bit samey and dull . i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though
0	you win some and you lose some . this purchase was a definite loss . what a dissapointment
1	while not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as coldplay , keane , and pete yorn , travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound . this , their 2nd album , is the best of their music : melodic throughout , with catchy tunes , solid lyrics , and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'sing ' to the fade-out from 'the humpty dumpty love song ' . if you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent , then i confidently recommend the invisible band to you . rating each song individually for one 's ipod : 1 . sing , side , the cage , afterglow and the humpty dumpty love song are each worthy of four to five stars 2 . pipe dreams , flowers in the window , safe , follow the light , and indefinitely are three to four star songs 3 . the balance are two to three stars each . the only poor effort is probably `` last train '' , which is too plodding relative to its counterparts the invisible band is basically a healthy mix of folksy , hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy . nowhere is this better reflected than in 'the humpty dumpty love song ' , which defines this mix perfectly . while this is the best of the album , the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly . highly recommended
1	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original `` metal box '' of ep 's , when it first came out . years later the `` second edition '' came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out . eventually the second edition came out on this cd . so i finally could own a digital copy myself . pristine , audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion , if i remember correctly . you do need to listen to this . you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
1	this cd is soo cool ! ! i love all the songs ! they are all good efforts . i especially like mr. coffee you have got ta hear that song ! other than that this is a great cd ! ! buy it today ! ! you 'll enjoy i
1	this album is a classic , but its really short . dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion . i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco ' and its accompaning popularity . it is nice ( and a relief ) i might add , to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form . not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo . it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva . which are difficult to find anywhere . also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces . this is truly pure flamenco at its best
0	based on the reviews for this cd i decided to buy it without having sampled it . big mistake . i love , among others , marshall crenshaw , don dixon and peter holsapple , but what happened here ? this was so not fabulous
0	although prince is an utter genious ! this cd is merely a boring contract filler . i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album `` musicology '' instead
0	the schumann that is presented here is a forgery . do n't get me wrong . i 'm not railing against schumann at all . the question here is what makes schumann great , and the way that bernstein presents these symphonies says schumann is great for the wrong reasons . the real schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music . schumann was not a hopeless romantic . he was one composer in a long line of `` classicists '' which ended with brahms , yet at the same time he was an innovator , pushing forward , trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression . he had plenty of dignity , and he did n't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him , which is exactly what it sounds like here . bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying . yes , many of these performances are the slowest on record , but this is a bad thing . these beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick , waxy , overly romantic textures and phrasing . tell me , did schumann ever write : `` to be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically , with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics '' in his score ? no ! he did not . these performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word , and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this . you may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in karajan 's filth , but that 's not saying much at all . and for this slight favor bernstein does for the music , he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit . the most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony , taken at half tempo . all semblance of melody and motion is lost . this movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first , and not the longest movement of the symphony , not to mention the longest movement in the entire set . in fact , almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing . also , while looking at the scores , you might notice that bernstein does away with detail work this time around . carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand `` romantic '' gestures . observing details in schumann , ironically , helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly . this is n't honest music-making here , only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
1	this is a great collection of hits from the 70 's . it is packed with hits . it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection
0	i gave this a good listen , but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable
1	no collection of blues/rock is complete without `` a piece of your soul '' . there very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc . from the raunchy ( `` bitter rain '' ) to the uplifting ( `` good day for the blues '' ) to the bittersweet ( `` cynical '' ) to the soft ( `` share that smile '' ) storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique . put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island
0	michael jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time . you can discuss his person , you can discuss his behaviour , and all the other stuff , but you ca n't really take that away from him . and that 's exactly why this album is so unacceptable , coming from someone like him - when you 've reached superstardom and gone beyond it , you do n't release a record that 's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it 's bound to be a faliure . at least , you should expect to hear for it . and hear for it he did , cause the critics did n't go lightly on this one . and it 's not that bad , actually . i mean , that 's what i have my program function in my cd-player for , and my cd-burner . the album starts on a fair streak - unbreakable , heartbreaker and invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for mj , sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from dangerous that were then discarded for history and then discarded for blood on the dance floor , and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that , if you forget who made this music , these are actually good , funky dance tracks . for michael jackson they 're passable , but nothing more . *skip* on to track 8 - speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record . one of only two tracks that jackson actually penned himself , and it shows . the amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone , and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks : joy for the music , and personal emotion . the lyrics are like a poem , and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity . top grade to jackson for this one track , and if you are into his music , buy the cd cheeply just to get this track . track 9 - 2000 watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record . this one is simply plain fun , and that 's another important lesson jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns , and stop caring whether it 's hip or street or down with the trend - because it is n't - but this is darn good pop music , and nigh irresistable . *skip* on to track 13 - cry - penned by r. kelley . the same r. kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times ( i believe i can fly , if you had doubts ) , but it seems that with jackson , he can do no wrong . he wrote the endearing you are not alone - major hit in europe - and this track is possibly even better . oh , forget about the sappy lyrics , and just enjoy the wonderfull music . this is pop writing in top class , and if jackson sounds like he takes the marthyr role a bit too seriously , it 's still one of the best tracks on the record . track 14 - the lost children - is the other song penned by michael alone , and it 's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro , you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune . as it is , it falls somewhat flat , and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes , it 's a nice tune . thumps up , mr. jackson . track 15 - whatever happens . ok , that 's one weird track . michael jackson featuring santane . wtf ? well , kudos for doing this , and it actually works , in a sort of absurd way . not single potential , and not a classic , but it 's not embarassing , and as an album filler , it 's completely acceptable as a cureosity . well , what about the rest of it then ? lead single you rock my world was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad . i can accept that on the record . the same is not true for the horrible ballads break of dawn , heaven can wait , butterflies , you are my life and do n't walk away . one is worse than the next , and every time i just try to listen to them , i start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal . yes , it 's that bad , no really , it 's horrible . i . ca n't . stand . these . songs . period . there are simply no redeeming qualities for me . and then the two monstrosities - privacy and threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself . tabloid junkie from history actually worked , because it packed a great punch , and well , had not been heart before . well it had been , it was pretty much the same as why you wan na trip on me from dangerous , but still . it worked . ghosts was a good track of blood on the dance floor . forget about the movie that was - well , embarassing . but the music was good . these tracks are n't . they sound dated , repetitive , out of place and utterly boring and uninspired . get over it jackson , we do n't want to hear more about the media nagging you , it 's not going to make them go away . well , all in all , what do we have ... to take the album from a to z : unbreakable - 6/10 - a fair dance track . heartbreaker - 6/10 - same . invincible - 6/10 - same . break of dawn - 0/10 - horrible r'n'b overproduced . vomit . heaven can wait - 0/10 - same . you rock my world - 5/10 - well , at least it sounds new . butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit . speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt . one true mj song . 2000 watts - 8/10 - very enjoyable , and stands out tall compared to the rest . you are my life - 0/10 - even more vomit . privacy - 2/10 - yawn . repetitive and dated . do n't walk away - 0/10 - end of vomit . cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship , kelly + jackson works - again . the lost children - 6/10 - well , it has potential . whatever happens - 7/10 - interesting , and well , refreshing , if somewhat strange . threatened - 2/10 - same as privacy , and exactly as boring . this yields and average about 3.6/10 , or 2/5 stars , which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well . yes , i 'm harsh , but from a man as gifted as jackson , you just expect more . quality control next time , please , mr. jackson . on the bottom line : outtakes the way you love me and we 've had enough showed up on the 2004 ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far . go figure
0	do you know why this double cd is often in the bargain basement ? simply because it is an inferior product . for some very odd reason , the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember . for all we know , it may have been a copyright problem . i bought this for my dad about 5 years ago , but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it . the live recordings on this cd are dismal and not related to the awesome `` hot august night '' . fortunately for me , i own the right neil diamond cd 's which contain the studio versions . these are still available . the first is called `` 12 greatest hits '' ( a black and white photo a young neil ) , and the second is called `` 12 greatest hits volume 2 '' ( a colour photo of neil sitting on a sofa ) . both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight ! ! ! just released is a new compilation called neil diamond gold , as part of the gold series but i do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings . all i know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
1	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt . lots of cool instrumentation . pete anderson did a great job with the production . this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago
0	this cd is pretty awful , you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd , one of the worst songs ever is calling , , it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground , na na na na , na na na na , i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer ... ... ..
0	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice , but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd . she 's lowered herself to a `` brittany spears-wanna-be . '' monotone songs , horrible bass , every song sounds the same . i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music . buy this one and you 're just wasting your money . would the real charlotte church please come back ? ? ? ?
0	i really really really really like allison moorer . have been a fan since her first record , have road-tripped to see her numerous times , and love her songwriting and singing . that said -- `` getting somewhere '' is by far the least satisfying of her records . no memorable songs . over-produced . no `` guts '' , as another reviewer said . when the allison moorer/doyle `` butch '' primm songwriting team called it quits ( in more ways than one ) , their lennon/mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost . not that moorer sounds like the beatles , but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music . this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again . such a shame . i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan . but this cd left me cold . it hurts a bit to say this , but i can not recommend this cd . the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of `` the larry sanders show '' . in that episode , sanders ' head writer phil ( played by wallace langham ) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy . as a result he lost his edge . when he was a miserable person he was an edgy , cynical , funny jokewriter . when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job . same with moorer . since her recent changes in her social life she has started `` singing a sweeter tune '' in her life , but it came with a cost . she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that `` other '' songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy , sad , sometimes bitter , or at least that 's how i interpreted it . granted , that was n't her entire oeuvre , but it is what made her songs special for me . now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur
1	jeff beck is far from the typical rock guitarist . he never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is . instead , he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen to this cd over and over again . that 's what musicianship is all about , and jeff has plenty of it
0	i just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.hard.okay , there are some song that deserve this.to be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.but come on ! they killed 'my immortal ' ! that is a beautiful song ! i 'm listning to it as i write this ! and also , little 6-year-olds can not properly appreciate it ! and , let 's face it , 'my immortal ' is not exactly a kiddie song.i mean , do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams , your voice it chased away all the sanity in me , these wounds wo n't seem to heal , this pain is just too real , there 's just too much that time can not erase ' ? please , stop buying this crap ! not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation , but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.i mean , come on ! go look up the lyrics to 'toxic ' ! that is definatly not a good song for little children . of corse , the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.then someone should sit them down and explain why this is not for them . die kidz bop
1	this album is hard ! e-40 always come sic wit it . if you do n't got it , ya betta git it . it reminds me of his ( my fav . ) '' i a major way '' album . sluppin ' from intro till outro . he is the bay area 's finnest . please belave it
1	this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10+ years they 've been together . it 's easily worthy of 10 stars . this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow , and to get more intimate with the band . i hav n't purchased this album yet , because i already have all their albums , but plan on it . the new tracks are from the answer that , and very proud of ya era . they 've finally been released on cd . this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also . anyway , buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try
0	on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums ( i think it is shaker ) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert . that should have been as far as it went . to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery . if these are blues songs , then i am robert johnson 's illegitimate son . `` death letter '' is good , maybe even great , but can not compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard . the rest is a waste of time . the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd . these are my first 2 reviews by the way , but all these 5-star reviews for both cd 's finally got me motivated . go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain
0	boo-wop ? haha ok , anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it . the problem is the singing and the overall production . this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal . the vocals are waaaaay weak . what exactly is a `` re-worked '' debut album ? ? ? i thought once an album was out it was done , set in stone ? apparently not , so mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid ( who changed their first album cover years after it came out ! ) and take the cheezy way out . a definete step up from bands like blitzkid , but still in the cellar of rock n roll . do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
0	whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers , robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs . that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey ( or peter lang ) is puzzling to say the least . but , credit where credit 's due : it 's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant
0	why is dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ? shame on you bob
1	being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it -- '' daydream nightmare '' and `` outlaw blues '' . at first i was a little puzzled -- the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were -- grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go 'round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle -- it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine -- it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is -- the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar/sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another `` weak link '' on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing/recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored
0	ok , i 've listened to fat boy slim . that guy 's stuff is n't bad , by no means main stream , but worth while . but ... this norman cook - he 's horrible . it 's no wonder cook developed an alter ego . with the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes , i could n't believe this `` stuff '' had come from the same artist that produced praise you . renegade master is the type of track i 've come to know and respect ( that one is a keeper ) , and i have to give props for i left my wallet in el segundo . other than that , this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market . if this is the sound you 're looking for , save a few bucks , check out your local yard sales . so as not to be too negative , i 'll say this ; the printing job on the cd itself is charming . the notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
0	i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful `` supergroups '' . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $ uck . when damn yankees released their 1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their `` supergroup '' scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller -- -- '' why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . '' supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup
0	once again , the geniuses at universal have failed to give fans a decent collection ! although the single disc very best of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of robert palmer 's career , it omitted a few `` must have '' songs in favour of live material ( making for a 90 % ok collection ) . earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from `` redo '' syndrome : the artist redoing a vocal track here , a drum mix there , re-recording entire songs elsewhere . this collection 's no different . in fact , there are many `` remixed '' and `` redone '' and `` alternate vocal '' mixes present ( something the very best of album avoided altogether , much to its credit ) . here , insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing . indeed , the classic and sequenced `` sailing shoes/hey julia/sneaking sally through the alley '' trilogy that marked the beginning of palmer 's breakthrough album is present , but the songs have been scattered apart from one another . thereby pondering the question : what were they thinking ? why was this done in this manner ? what do fans really want ? a 2 disc set that features the original material ( remastered , yes , but not remixed in any way , shape or form ) and a proper chronological sequence . done in this manner , such a set would properly honour one of popdom 's most memorable and talented individuals . what gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia , took the right batch of songs , but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner . this collection does no one any favours . stick to very best of until another bright light at universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection . that said , the way the music biz is these days , do n't count on it .
0	my two parakeets seem to enjoy this cd a bit , but if you want a cd for relaxing listening , be prepared to be irritated . i tried to go to sleep listening to it one night . i had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves ... ..i kept thinking it was stuck ... .like a record stuck in a grrove . it sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the `` repeat '' button on a couple of bird sounds . i think i could have done that . i 'm just glad it did n't cost a lot , but now i can see why . sorry for such a bad review , but i just had to tell anyone planning on buying it . i now just play it for my birds when i am not in the room
1	eddie 's first all-studio recording , and the album that got me hooked . i must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live , this album demonstrates the range and diversity of eddie from ohio . `` oh my brother '' is a particular favorite with julie murphy wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice , and robbie schaffer 's talent for emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation . if this song does n't touch your heart , you have no appreciation for music . a particular plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of `` yerushalyim shel zahav '' by guest musician pete wilson on `` jerusalem , '' another song by robbie , this time also performed by him . as always , the amazing prowess of this group is displayed magnificently
1	sometimes i like to look up and see what i can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70 's and starz being one of them . i was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78 . another band that took time for their fans ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that i can add , also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music . i would recommend reading about each of the starz cd 's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself ... ... .. i remember i liked this cd so much and the logo as well , i even hand- made a stencil and made my own starz shirt , i think i used some of that gold `` glue on glitter '' in a tube and had one of the first starz shirts , before the band even had any if i remember right . lots of good songs on this cd , pull the plug being one of my favorites both on the lp/cd and live . all good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more ... ... ... i could go on trying to describe the music ... ... ... . too bad there are no sound files for this cd ... ... . so you may just have to order it and take a chance . the remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player richie ranno continues to be active in the music business , you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what richie and the band are up to . singer michael lee smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into hollywood ... ... . but this is about starz ! ! ! ... so ... . i highly recommend checking out the cd 's and starzcentral . not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from europe that is using the name recently
1	this remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound , but the only way top hear aoxomoxoa is to find a original w7 ( warner brothers-seven arts ) green label vinyl pressing . the cd features the 1971 remix ( like the 1989 cd ) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like constanten 's prepared backrounds on `` what 's become of the baby '' , the extra drums and barbershop vocal on `` doin that rag '' . st stephen lost something in the remix as well . anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on cd . no hidden goodies on this disc , but the bonus tracks are great
1	lead singer and co-founder david gates was recently inducted into the songwriters hall of fame . this album is one prime example of why . david has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy , sensitive lyrics . his last album was a country album called `` love is always seventeen , '' which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country , co-produced and performed with billy dean . but back to this gem . `` guitar man , '' and `` aubrey '' were the big hits off of this album , and they still stand the test of time . `` tecolote '' is one of their most unusual departures , and still makes me laugh , while enjoying its musicality and orignality . `` did n't even know her name '' is a poignant lost love song ; `` welcome to the music '' is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to what to expect . even larry knechtel gets in on the vocals with the intriguing `` picture in my mind . '' it 's a great album -- -in fact , there 's not a bad `` bread '' album out there ! enjoy , and relive those magical moments of the glorious seventies
0	in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance , lewis ( burt reynolds ) gives this ominous warning to ed ( jon voigt ) : `` machines are going to fail . systems are going to fail . then ... survival . '' what , i wonder , will richard d. james ( a.k.a . aphex twin , a.k.a . afx ) do when the machines fail ? it 's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs , where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question : the plaintive , lovely , satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract , frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration . [ another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica : alarm will sound performs aphex twin ... ] chosen lords , rdj 's first proper cd release since then , is actually a collection of various tracks from his `` analord series '' of overpriced , elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he 's been cranking out over the last year or so . those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled , drum-machine laden compositions as a `` return to greatness . '' indeed , afx is certainly reviving a more compact , accessible ( for him ) , and straightforward style here , with comparatively regular ( though not quite danceable ) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies . i have to say , though , that there 's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels . by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way , without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy , windowlicker , the richard d. james album , and , yes -- drukqs . notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true , they were usually rather unsettling , distorted , and manipulated voices , but at least they added some welcome humanity . also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose ( ballads ? ) such as `` flim , '' `` nannou '' and the striking piano interludes on drukqs . in the end , chosen lords , while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music , is nonetheless a sterile , static , joyless affair . if it inspires any emotion at all , it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career . yes , i 'm afraid the machines have failed richard d. james , and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
0	before you all dismiss me as an obsessive , close-minded thrash fanatic ; i thoroughly enjoyed `` chaos ad , '' which was a sep ' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal . i like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds , but with those sounds , max decided to throw in downtuned guitars , not doing guitar solos , excessive profanity , lame `` i hate this i hate that '' lyrics , and guest musicians . the only decent songs on here are `` roots bloody roots '' and `` dictators*** ; '' everything else is awful . this is n't sepultura , this is soulfly . i 'm glad max left because if he stayed in the band , sep ' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band . for good sepultura albums , get these instead ( starting with the best ) : schizophrenia morbid visions/bestial devastation beneath the remains arise chaos ad dante xxi nation roorback ps , you max fanatics need to cut derik green some slack , he 's keeping sep ' alive while max is making an arse of himself with soulfly
1	the relaxation set is just that , pure relaxation . i love the active relaxation cd . i can read or work and i am real calm , on an even keel , feeling like when you go to sleep at night , not quite asleep and not quite awake . i also enjoy the water and the piano playing . highly recommended
0	ok , so the song playing when brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called `` deep enough ( urban remix ) '' by live . i have the other songs written down , including the one played between the two buildings , so i will find them and tell you . if you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie , rent the dvd , and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists . that 's how i have only the songs that are in the movie
0	i ca n't believe rubbish like this goes platinum . rap today with a few exceptions is a joke . people like chingy , nelly , ludacris , ja rule , lil jon and any other idiot with lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke . what is really getting me angry is how so many people do n't give any respect to real rap legends like tupac and biggie , and give tons of respect to all these clowns . people are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to . all these people talk about is money , bling bling and sex . rap used to be about the streets now its just all i 've got so much money and stuff . if you want a real rap cd then get one of the following . nwa - straight outta compton ice cube - amerikka 's most wanted dr dre - the chronic snoop doggy dogg - doggystyle nas - illmatic tha dogg pound - dogg food tupac - me against the world tupac - all eyez on me tupac - greatest hits 50 cent - power of the dollar biggie - life after death you get the picture
1	i agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like natures way and i got a line not huge hits ? i got a line made the top 40 i think.natures way was a great acoustic ballad.also nothing to hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also mister skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960 's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album i think it would get five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts , like a live i got a line or natures way live hearing that live would of been fun . i heard samples on a live spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days
0	this cd is not at all what it appears to be . they got other people singing and playing the music , so it 's not what you 're probably looking for . terrible misrespresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i used my other party cd 's or my guests would have left ... ... and i would have held the door open ... ..not blamed them for leaving !
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks . i love the wheel , but darn if this is n't just terrible . there is n't even a single on it ; i ca n't believe the studio released it . thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store . the catherine wheel needs to get back together -- quick
1	wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories ! a must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes neil diamond 's top hits .
0	with 2 cds of endless repeated chords , they do n't have much to say
1	this album is the shyit , cougnut and c-fresh deliver , the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh , but as you listen you will tell differences . `` back in the days '' is real old album , so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album . the beats do n't get too bass heavy untill `` hillary '' after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy , but the flows are tops . these guys are the definition of gangsta , and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap . all guests are sick to , dre dog , cellski , chewy , r.b.l,2.2 and mack and al kapone . definetly a classic
1	after watching the movie walk the line , i wanted to hear more of johnny cash . all these years ( 35 of them ) i always thought he was just a slow folk singer . his music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff . he toured with elvis presely and jerry lee lewis . he inspired musicians like bob dylan . i am so glad i bought this cd . it 's the best purchase i made all year .
1	i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong . this cd is not remastered . i baught this cd because of that review and got burned . the cd even says right on it aad . in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback . i will say this much though , the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own . however , if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the `` all time greatest hits/original recording remasterd '' cd from mca . it also has move over from this cd , i love this cd and want it remastered . if you got ta have this album ( i do ) than this version sounds better than the mca version
0	all in all , i was really dissapointed ; i really enjoyed the king geedorah album . i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar , thematic , production , tolerable skits , and street-wise but deep lyrical content . doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'escape ... ' all have the stereotypical doom sound , with the only standout being '1,2 ... 1,2 . ' the x-ray produced tracks are minimal , but generally sound stiff , lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines , few sampled melodies . i did like 'warning ( kong ) , ' which has a nice , minimal , dark groove . the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound , pretty good . lyrical content is pretty bad , unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d $ * .
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back ... so i bought him another
0	i should have reviewed this along with fm . both were double record hit soundtracks . both represented youth . both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing . one was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack . this is the terrible soundtrack . when the best songs are by billy squier and sammy hagar you know you 're in trouble . jackson browne , joe walsh , don henley are each awful . so were the go-go 's . not surprisingly don felder and jimmy buffet both sucked . i almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when graham nash played . the band that called themselves poco ca n't be the same poco i grew up with . there were some listenable tracks by timothy b. schmit , louise goffin and stevie nicks but then there 's quarterflash . however , amongst all this crap was a gem ... the very last song is goodbye goodbye by oingo boingo . this song rocks and danny elfman sounds crazed . unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash
0	as a contemporary of joan baez ( age-wise ) , i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice . i even empathize with much of her politics , but unfortunately it 's time she rested on her laurels . her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of , and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs , and her earlier quality . like some professional athletes , she seems to not know when to quit ...
0	as much as i like most of the songs on this cd ... it 's just too short . also the production is lousy . the recording quality sounds awful in places . hopefully , the updated compilations are better . this one is not worth the money ! ! !
1	this is a great cd ! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end . this makes it nice to just play the entire cd or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another . so far the car and washing machine tracks seem to be our baby 's favorites . when she outgrows the need for this white noise cd , we 'll transition her to lullaby or classical music . for now though , this cd helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times . as a bonus , the waves and rain on the roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
0	i bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of george orwell 's book came out , simply because it was attached to the movie . i 'll try not to use any non-family words here , but this soundtrack sucks . muldowney 's original score is available on cd , and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie . as far as this soundtrack goes , though ; skip it
0	john coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine . wynton and the lcjo are in effect the death of creative musicians like coltrane , or most of the truly creative jazz scene for that matter . wynton is establishing himself as `` the face of jazz '' . a market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music . by telling us ( and make no mistake , these guys do ... ) : `` this is what jazz is '' and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of jazz giants such as john coltrane who , if he were alive , would not be given the time of day by these folks , wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music . the recording , since i must talk about it , features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what coltrane was , mostly empty of content , setting in motions soloists who sound more like `` jazz puppets '' than anything remotely close to what coltrane was striving for ( notable exception : ted nash ! ) . you do not need this record . wynton and the lcjo does not need your money ; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge , the way coltrane did
1	this album was so good to hear when it came out . i like every song on here but my favorites are `` still dre '' , '' the watcher '' , '' xxplosive '' , '' what 's the difference '' and `` forget about dre . those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like . recommend this album highly to rap fans . buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst , and how dare him to diss krs-one , he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 , he just added to why he sucks . lets face it , all his songs are basically dumb and and really don , t have much texture involved . and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable . if you buy this album , you throw away good money . unless you like bubblegum rap . this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool , but lets face it , its played out
1	you have not heard his voice until to have heard andras schiff play the well tempered clavie
1	stiff upper lip is a good ac/dc album , it 's not a great ac/dc album . it kills me when people say that ac/dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done . nothing could be further from the truth . i have always thought that each ac/dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it 's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album . for instance , can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip ? or ballbreaker on back in black ? it does n't work . stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough , bluesy feel to it . brian 's voice sounds different , the tones and the guitars sound different . it 's good but not great . the standouts ... 1 . stiff upper lip- pretty rocking song . has a good attitude . it 's fun . 2 . hold me back and ca n't stand still . very odd rolling songs . they sound a lot alike . again , these songs could never have been on back in black . i have heard that brian sang ca n't stand still in one take , that 's why they all clap at the end . i do n't know if that 's true , but it 's an interesting song . 3 . satellite blues- this one is an instant classic . i love this song . this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long . everything else is ho hum . not good , not bad . better than most bands out there . i am really hoping ac/dc put out a killer album with their new release , whenever that is . i hope they do n't turn into the new g and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome
0	it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them , and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds . here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom , strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment . though not as crass and offensive as stolt 's `` wall street voodoo '' or bodin 's `` i am '' , this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness . there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release , but not enough to justify its purchase . stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that `` ... peace love never go out of fashion ... '' well , neither does informed maturity , and you wo n't find any of that in this group 's recent output . just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting . their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international , but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st. jude 's children 's hospital . i 'm going to sell my copy of `` paradox hotel '' , and probably several more flower kings cds , to do just that . there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies
1	this cd is dave bromberg 's best effort . playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated .

0	garbage metal - music for the american mainstream to feed on . i saw them open for slayer about 4-5 years back , and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except jumping up and down . how pathetic ! pick up some real metal ... . like old kreator .
1	goth meets cabaret , or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret . thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt . the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the `` dark cabaret '' scene , and do so quite well . the first song , coin-operated boy by the dresden dolls , is a great start , and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy ( which sets up a wonderful film noir mood ) and on to the darker , electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra , to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl . along the way numerous other bands are covered . sam rosenthal 's side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd , with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine , who also has a solo song ( pretty faces ) on the cd as well . personally , i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine 's voice to be quite alluring , but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you 've been warned . but all in all , i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd . at the very least , its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style , and thats always a good thing
0	my wife got this cd for me because i like the music from the movie cast away . she saw the words cast away in large and prominent print . she saw the picture of tom hanks , very large . she assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on the cd . in hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the cd . i guess the producers of this cd did n't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people would n't waste time returning it . if you had it listed in the rate column , i would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
0	i basically love anything mr. carter does , but this one has alot of great lyrics ( as usual ) . i 'm so glad he 's coming out of retirement . any fan of jay-z will enjoy this cd
1	this is just a great cd . whenever i need to restore inner harmony after work , or dealing with any upsetting situation , this is the one i go to . instantly i am transported to the calm , soothing setting of a traditional japanese house and garden . it is fantastic for meditation , too . let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
1	i have loved the swans since my danceteria days in early 80s new york . but its a fitful , frustrating love . you get the sense from 'incandesent ' that the swans forgot to stop partying . that they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs . oh , but what songs they were . this collection is for completists and aging post-punker ( like myself ) who wished they 'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act . its a nice collection of beautiful , quirky oddities here . but a few gems are missing `` holy holy '' , `` 1982 '' , `` world of milk and blood '' come to mind . maybe on an 'ashes ' reissue . in the meantime , scoop this up . simpson company deserve the attention . if you really care about the band , buy it directly from their label , renascent . that way the company ( and the band ) can make a few pennies . maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection .
1	i was looking for some music i could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came across this one -- the exact same `` album '' that i had when i was his age ! i 'm so glad they redid it ! one of my fondest memories
1	although this sports new remastering , unless you have either the golden hits cd available here at amazon and your local cd shop , the now out of print golden celebration boxed set or the 2 volume `` patti page collection '' series ( volume 2 is also out of print ) , this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on golden hits except for let me go lover instead of with my eyes wide open i 'm dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order . fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with let me go lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff , either buy golden hits , the boxed set and the 2 volume patti page collection series , and btw , vol . 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at amazon
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people ? sorry i just cant see it . i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's `` if i could only be sure '' on the first track at all : if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !
0	yeah , i am a big fan of moby , and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that , if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play , this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise , but fail to build up to anything , everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style , which were almost humorous , except , not [ this much money ] humorous , i am not a fan of this cd , i know he was starting out in a punk band , but his other stuff is much bette
1	some musicians , like fine chefs , make it look so easy . david grisman is one of them . on the cd , `` i 'm beginning to see the light , '' the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by scottish guitar virtuoso martin taylor and veteran grisman quintet members jim kerwin and george marsh ( on bass and drums/percussion , respectively ) for one hot little album . while the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards , such as `` autumn leaves , '' `` makin ' whoopee , '' `` lover man , '' and `` cheek to cheek , '' the taylor/grisman quartet seems to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible seasonings to the pot to make emeril shout , `` bam ! '' as don stierberg , who penned the liner notes , says : `` music need not be trendy to be great . '' i wholeheartedly agree . ( c.a . carlino
1	if you do n't love this cd ( and many people wo n't ) , then you must have a very different taste in music then me . yes , it 's different . yes , it 's offensive . yes , it 's incredibly powerful . mutiny in heaven is insanity on a disc , six strings that drew the blood is awesome , as is everything on this disc . simply brilliant , and best disc to start a birthday party obsession with
1	while i am not a big fan of john mclaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i can not deny that they really had something with this album.. it is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory ... there is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
1	if you like the beach boys and appreciate the technical quality behind telarc recordings , then this disc is a must have in your collection . first , papa doo run run does an excellent job covering beach boys tunes to the point where some people ca n't tell the difference , but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it . second , you 'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you 've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording . you can hear each instrument clearly . the beginning of `` i get around '' is almost explosive , they way the original recording should have been . telarc and papa doo run run have made a special album here . when i feel like listening to the beach boys , i usually grab this cd first
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings , this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now . there 's great , gentle interplay with jim hall , and a total sound that is most enjoyable . warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone
0	i am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist . this cellist tone is so powerfull and clear.she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks . alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull . the apres un reve was ok i guess . she really should of tooken more time . like floating on a dream cloud . when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure . the elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre
0	i love love tegan and sara and when i found out this was one of their favorite cds i have to admit ... .i think i was devastated . i just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.not just not enjoyable ... unbelieveably horrible . i think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music . do n't make your ears go through this much pain
1	quite different from his later big-band recordings . some of the songs that you may find on wes ' 'best of ' collections sound too much like elevator music . not so with this debut album . a drummer , a organist , and a guitar player ; no horn section . stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing . he shows of his trade mark octave playing , his chord solos ( played over the organs rythm chords none the less ) , and flashy runs across the fret board when needed . a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz .
0	many albums , including this one , have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same ; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks . the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music . `` what about everything '' and `` life less ordinary '' are good songs . the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep .
1	i 'll have to accept that even tough i 'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release , the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there . for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album , it 's very melodic and more mature . also the acoustic version of `` the diary of jane '' is amazing . i personally recommend the songs `` breath '' , `` evil angel '' and my favorite `` dance with the devil ''
0	if you like early priest , buy genocide . it has both rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny in their entirety ( the only thing it does not have is the original album artwork ) . not leaving out important tracks like the ripper , for pete 's sake ! ! ! how could you leave out the ripper ? and what about island of domination ? i feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with priest . they got jipped and did n't even know it . these are my favorite albums by priest and i hate to see them butchered like this ... and what about the order of the songs ? why would they mess with that too ? do youself a favor and buy either genocide , or if you like to have the original artwork , buy rocka rolla and sad wings of destiny seperately
1	i got the pleasure of seeing albert open for bb king . unfortunately for bb king , because once albert started playing his flying v , with blues power , he demoralized anybody that came after him . he had the entire universal amphitheater standing . and stayed standing for most of his show . blues power is one of his best . get , listen , and then really listen . because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..
1	with his snarling , gritty guitar tones , swampy grooves , and scratchy vocals , c.c . adcock makes butt-shakin ' music that blends rockabilly , old-school memphis r , new orleans funk , cajun dancehall tunes , and juke-joint blues . he 's young , but no poseur : having paid dues with bo diddley and buckwheat zydeco , adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand . but despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass , this is n't a retro-sounding record . adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous . doyle bramhall joins adcock on two songs , and together they raise 6-string hell . boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude , adcock 's music is soulful , somewhat twisted , and deeply satisfying
0	maan , ima venda spenda of dis shizzi hur but fur shur , iz hord cor poor . i meanz what i be sayin is i be buyin all the hip s*** but when i play dis on ma player my mind be hurtin , in da bad way . so fow sho , to all da playaz out thay stay clean of this bad crack , itll hurt yow mind and yow poket . fur shur dis is da flippa , keep it clean boyz ( yea , you punks now what i be sayin
1	this is what music is all about , the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note , or the raspy , delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian ; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure . think if tweaker were to make jazz -- and really chill out -- this is what it would sound like . you 'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet , ever . there is everything one could want . possibly the perfect record . it 's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul . absolutely brilliant and definitely essential . one of my favorites from the year .
0	2nd time .
1	my son loves music and really likes dan zanes . we started with the videos on disney and the `` catch that train '' song really got us singing , so we ordered this cd . now my son sings along with it , dances and jumps around . dan zanes really is fun for the family
1	this is one of his best cd 's . you really have to listen to the words on the cd , he takes you to whole another level . he is one of the best r singers ever , just close your eyes and listen to the song `` maybe '' and think of that special place for you and your lady
0	generally on amazon.com , the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is , the albums are usually highly overrated . this is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve . as a result of this , generally , albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums . ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album . average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album . as i mentioned before , due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums , the average score rarely falls below 3 stars . it takes a pretty horrendous album , like limp bizkit 's results may vary , to get a score of even 2.5 . in fact , i did n't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is , until i saw this pile of feces . now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of `` hataz '' reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it . out of all the terrible albums i have viewed , i have never seen this happen before . not even to bands as terrible as limp bizkit or even an*l c*nt . this obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and , hopefully , the end of chingy 's 15 minutes of fame
0	while the title cut with joe public was bumping most of this disc is so-so & amp ; formula driven.without teddy riley the grooves & amp ; vibe are n't as strong
1	feinstein is in love with the gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in pure gershwin . michael 's love affair with ira 's lyrics , his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and lesser known -- phrases , more than makes up for the less polished vocal production in this early album . in fact , it is that very element that sells these songs as i 've never heard them elsewhere . michael pulls out all stops , embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of `` embraceable you '' , with the unbridled passion of a first time lover . his duet with rosie clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie in which this unknown number made its debut . what a delightful approach michael demonstrates throughout ... . oh , to be that young and exuberant about life , love and music again
0	yo nu-mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac . this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan . they take great songs and make crappy beats . get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money
0	i found a supposedly `` new remastered edition '' of sade 's `` diamond life '' on sale for less than 10 bucks . oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it , the cd store was already out of business , and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as `` 2000 digital remastered version '' . the whole album has been re-recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good , but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator ' really sucks ! !
0	i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally .
0	i own this set , as does my roomate , and we both hate it . it highlights bands like 'red lorry , yellow lorry ' that no one likes or listens to , and uses great classic bands like bauhaus ' worst song as the first track . it is the hollow , tin-y , embarrassingly hokey side of goth , and i am ashamed to even have it in my house
0	on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the `` ukraine is weeeeak '' . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent `` rock the shack '' and of course `` crystal '' , which i 'll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden . too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so ... someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n't do very often , just like van morrison . now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? '60 miles an hour ' , `primitive notion ' , and `close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is `crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of `as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade , thus putting me in constant cravings for new material . though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band , they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch . truly vast and intimate at the same time , and a voice that speaks to something very deep , sad and lovely inside you
0	i thought it would have nice , soft songs . but , it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation
0	after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd . unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones . as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground . the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me . the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic . since nobody else has complained of this rumble , i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
1	growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart , i did n't think i 'd like this cd . one evening i was having dinner at a friend 's home and they had this one playing . it was beautiful . being a little older now ( in my early 40 's ) , i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now . this cd of rod 's was nostalgic , romantic and extremely easy to listen to .
1	... and if you 're fortunate enough to find it , i recommend buying the version with the bonus dvd , which chronicles the making of yellow brick road . when i bought it , it cost the same as the 2 sacd set without the dvd , so it was still a great deal . my only complaint -- and it 's really minor -- is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single sacd . a second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package , plus any extra -- maybe even audio-only interviews -- still remaining in the vaults . no matter . the important thing , if you are able , is to make sure you have an sacd-compatible player ( like the pioneer dv-563a , or one of the really expensive players if you 've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your cds ) . even if you do n't , the stereo cd layer still sounds truly excellent
0	neither the amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact . i have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'songs for swinging lovers ' - frank sinatra or beethoven 's opera fidelio - conductor otto klemperer ( testament label ) . the material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings . i did not hear anything outstanding on this cd to make me overlook the 'mono ' factor . is this some great jazz masterpiece , recorded live in carnegie hall by two giants of jazz ? i personally do n't think so . somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old . with small jazz bands , i like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis . examples : 'sunday at the village vanguard - bill evans trio ' or 'new york reunion - mccoy tyner quartet ' . i wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording . this material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados . it may have been hasty but after one listen i decided to sell this cd and i have no regrets other than buying it in the first place .
1	only 2 words can describe this great cd and they are ( simply incerdible ) im only 17 but i know great oldschool when i hear it and this is fantastic musi
0	oh , this is pure adult garbage all right . i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this , then again the movie was garbage also
1	martina mcbride 's `` emotion '' album contains many pop country elements , but is still nonetheless a great album . here 's how i rate each song . ( out of a 5 star scale ) 1 ) do what you do- good song , but takes a little to get used to . ( 4 stars ) 2 ) anything 's better than feeling the blues- good songs , good lyrics . ( 4 stars ) 3 ) i love you- great song , martina 's most successful song on the country charts , spending 5 weeks in the top spot . ( 5 stars ) 4 ) make me believe- great song about whether one 's love is true or not ... . i love the lyric `` but it 's hard to start a fire without a spark ( 5 stars ) 5 ) love 's the only house- this song will draw a strong connection to your heart . the song is spectacular and speaks the truth ... love is truly the only house big enough for all the world 's pain . the video to this song is very touching as well . go martina ! ( 5 stars ) 6 ) there you are- a perfect wedding song ... she hold the `` are '' note for at least 12+ seconds near the end . ( 5 stars ) if you hear this song live , she holds the note 15 seconds ! ! ! ! ( so live this song will be 6 stars/5 stars ! ! ! ! ) 7 ) it 's my time- the first song that i ever heard martina perform live in the ama awards ... she rocked the house down with this song ... she also holds a 10 second note at this song . love that range of hers . ( 5 stars ) 8 ) i ai n't goin ' nowhere- i like this song and its message about being there for a significant other . ( 5 stars ) 9 ) anything and everything- the lyrics and martina 's gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection . ( 5 stars ) 10 ) from the ashes- another standout song on this album . she holds some high notes in this one too . ( 5 stars ) 11 ) goodbye- a solid performance , i llike how martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song . ( 4 stars ) 12 ) this uncivil war- the best song on the album ! ! ! ! amazing ! ! ! ! written by gretchen , the writer of martina 's career hit `` indepedence day . '' a very emotional song , which defines the title of the album . the ending is a real treat as well . ( 6 stars ! ) this album is definitely worth purchasing ! ! ! it helps complete my collection of martina 's albums
0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song , people will keep getting them for free in internet . nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop , pop , commercial , elevator music . if you like that kind of music , buy this cd , otherwise buy hubert laws , or dave valentin among others . if you want to listen to good nestor music , buy `` morning ride '' , `` dance of the phoenix '' , `` talk to me '' , `` mi alma latina '' or the charanga album `` mis canciones primeras '' . sorry nestor , i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff . when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album
1	her voice takes my breath away , i fell in love with her . i highly reccomend it
1	linkin park are still together and they are making their next album , it is due out eairly next year . mike just did this for fun . look into things a little more buddy before you start saying things . oh yeah , and if you like good hip-hop , you 'll like this album . give it a shot . you dont have to be a linkin park fan to enjoy this record , since its nothing like lp . peace
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop ... the format of the album the presence of rakim ... .his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86 ' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south
1	i ca n't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album . not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless . very hurtful . lousy counterpoint to her warmth . i do n't think they understand that she does n't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching . take her as an original instead of as a mimic . what do i hear ? i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch 's brilliant piano accompaniment . bill frisell is very good , too . i love jazz pop as well as opera . ren ? e fleming can make it any of these genres . these songs are very much her own interpretation . they are 'deeper ' than what you 've heard before . even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing `` you 've changed , '' ren ? e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully , in her own style , and very touching , too . she 's not carried by full orchestration , mostly just fred and her . i was going to write that `` my one and only love '' was especially good , but as the cd kept playing , i must say that they are all especially good . enjoy
1	i do not own this cd , but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away . he had a good sense of humor and was very worldly . he would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club 's heart rate had spead up 100 notches ... and boom ... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie . at the break i met him , and got an autograph . he was very insightful musical and with spoken words.i would reccomend seeing him live , aswell as buying his album
0	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music , singing sucks ... this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock ... if you think i 'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice , he ca n't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush , he sucked at country and has no place in rock ... home boy go back to texas and get back to branded some cows cause you suck
0	this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to . it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock . if you 're a fan of this type of music , i recommend this cd , but if not , do n't buy it . there are only a few good tracks . all star , bad reputation , i 'm a believer , stay home . and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1/3 of it is good . so , i would n't buy it , if i were you .
0	if you have children that are five years younger , this would be a good album to put in your child 's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player . but if your children are six and up . your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs . this album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but can not afford it . this ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in rwanda , sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap . parents , if you buy this album , after your children turn 6 years old . pack this cd and other ki8dz bop cd 's and send them to africa . this is pop music for impoverished folks
1	having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band ! while the singer ( conor oberst ) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands , he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout ( unlike a band like taking back sunday ) the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental , the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and do n't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit . if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes , if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album . it dies today rip off the former bands style , but they are still a very good band . in the over-crowded metalcore market of today , that is a rarity . my only complaint , is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice ( as heard on `` the radiance ) , but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music . still 5/5 material though . favorite songs : `` the radiance , '' `` freak gasoline fight , '' `` our disintigration , '' and : the caitliff choir : defeatism
1	a very proud and highly recommended production , it 's a real pitty this cd is not available , i still have this one as a precious thing , i hear it all the time as well as i want . nobody will forget jeff lynne as an excellent musician , ever
0	rob touches on so much with this cd . my favorite song is one that has n't got any airplay and , in my opinion , the public missed out a great hit ! `` streetcorner symphony '' is about people coming together . it 's what i call my happy song . each day as i go to work i play the song as loud as i can get it ! we , my daughters and i , saw him live and he also called it a happy song ! i ca n't wait for his live albulm to come out ! there are fast and slow songs on this cd and will be worth every penny you spend to buy it ! incredible voice and songwritting
1	its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words . suffice to say , level 1 is a timeless classic , in fact , it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b . logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads & amp ; music lovers in general . demon 's theme , western , danny 's song & amp ; horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre . bukem 's level 1 displays his flawless production & amp ; track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline & amp ; ambient bliss
1	what has happened to the song `` lives in the balance '' on this set ? if you go to his website it sounds really great ! ! ! on this set it sounds awfull ! ! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with . the packaging if you could call it that is really lame . foam dots for holders ? what do you do when those fall off ? i suppose you put the cd 's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up . not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work ! true you do get alot of songs for the money but , there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it . if you own an i-pod i suggest you go to apples i-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less
0	i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff ... play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this ... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen ... i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gon na be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds
0	forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today 's `` music '' too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them , `` hollaback girl '' is the absolute dumbest `` song '' i 've ever had the displeasure to hear . there are two main parts to this travesty : 1 . where she says `` that 's my sh** '' no less than a million times , and 2 . she demonstrates that she 's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us . if this is supposed to be rap , stefani failed miserably . if it 's supposed to be dance , again , she failed miserably . to be honest , i do n't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure is n't music . the fact that it was number one for so long proves that perhaps people do n't have any requirements for their ears . - donna di giacom
0	if you want the original recordings , do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits . i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc . these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of `` the beverly hillbillies '' and `` the munsters '' that just do n't sound right to me . if the original recordings do n't matter to you , then you may like this cd
1	joan . you do n't love me . because i 'm a guy . but i have loved you since 1976 . ok so i 'm an old man ( age 43 ) . so what . she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet . i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett . this album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs . does n't mattar . i love it . and the video ... well it confirms what we have always known . not that it matters . the music matters
1	really nothing on this is bad . the best imho is rubyhorse , the brian jonestown massacre and the subways but a case could be made for any of the songs . the only problem is now i have 8 other cds i need to buy
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy , scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way , it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind . where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album , black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo . the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey , and , personally , like a lay 's potato chip , not able to listen to just one ... .yeah , i need the whole thing..
0	i wo n't go into a long diatribe . suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year , i was disappointed . i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great . this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit . there 's a point where baez messes up a song . ( i do n't have anything against baez . that being said , i do n't have much for her either . ) there 's joking and laughing , but really , i do n't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing . you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert . the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them . if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff , you should be pleased with this double-disc . i love dylan , but not enough to enjoy this over and over again . i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
0	generally harmless , except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents . the song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated , cynical adults . but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old . i would n't bring this cd into your house
1	i wore out my tape of cypress . afoot is great , but cypress is amazing . i bought this while stationed in the army . there were n't too many `` new wave '' tapes available at the px , and i was n't going to listen to def leppard or bon jovi . so i bought cypress . one of those rare tapes that i bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months ( the jam 's snap and setting sons , and the smith 's hatful of hollow are 3 other tapes i never tired of ) . get this cd . get it now ! it is great . thanks for reissuing it .
0	this soundtrack does not have all the songs in it from the movie . i was looking for two from the movie , and the soundtrack did not have them . like , a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there . bo
0	to much guitar , drowns out all the other instruments . survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums , not guitars . i was expecting another burning heart , is this love , high on you . no songs on this albums have that sound . the vocals by jamison are top notch , but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember . survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards , bass and drums , not drive the whole song . i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along . i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel , the rest are throw aways . ***recommended for die hards only*** i highly recommend 'when seconds count ' for anyone getting started with survivor
1	with all the recent praise heaped on smile , orange crate art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated . sure , smile was supposed to be this grand copelandesque landscape of america , from plymouth rock to the grand cooley dam . but for my money brian and van dyke parks did it so much better with orange crate art . having written , what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most california of all anthems , fun fun fun , i get around and california girls , brian turns his attention to a california not of hot rods and surf , but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine . here wilson and parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of jack london and john steinbeck . and if all this were not enough , we 're treated to my hobo heart , a latter day van dyke parks / michael hazelwood masterpiece . there 's also the lovely palm tree moon , a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach , territory not unfamiliar to brian . and summer in monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make clint eastwood blush . if you have n't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet , you really ca n't call yourself a brian wilson / van dyke parks fan until you give this one a fair shot . you might even find yourself humming sail away or hold back time while in the shower . i know i did
1	this is lovely stuff . the other reviews say why much better than i can , but i just had to add to the adoration
0	i got this cd because i loved their radio hits `` bring me to life '' and `` my immortal . '' while those songs are beautiful , they are not representative of the rest of the album . although i tried and tried to get into this cd , the hard rock teen goth style just is n't my cup of tea , and the lyrics are too depressing . if you are a fan of bands such as linkin park or seether , you might enjoy this . however , if you only like `` my immortal '' and `` bring me to life '' because of amy 's powerful vocals , you 'd be better off listening to tori amos or sarah mclachlan .
0	this disc is bad ! ! ! right at the 2 '' mark the sound of the `` rock water '' is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub . this sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour . other discs of this type that i 've heard do n't do this
1	like i said i would , i finally got around to purchasing this cd . i especially like tracks 9-12 . cheap trick is solid as always . i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases . if i do have any criticism at all , it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs . i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years . anyway , there are some great tunes on this . buy it like i did !
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time . oh my god , i am breathless . i was brought to tears as they sang `` mama '' . my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all . all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could . thank you for touching my heart . i really recommend that you give this cd a chance . all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score , obviously need a hearing aid and a heart . blessing
1	his playing on this album reminds me of that of bill evans . i am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought . comparison to bill evans is the best compliment i know how to give
1	i have only recently become a country music fan . i was n't sure i would like faith hill , but this was the first cd of hers i purchased . from the very first song `` this kiss , '' i was instantly drawn into her music . what i love about her songs is that they are so real . `` you give me love '' is so real and so strong . it 's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change . `` the secret of life '' has taken some getting used to . it is not my absolute favorite on the cd . `` me '' is the song that means the most to me since i have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship . and `` i love you '' is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar . she has a big voice , and she nails each song on this cd . give it a try
0	the most untalented producer in the business . honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit . the rest of this is trash . especially those chickenheads total . and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass . dont give this bum anymore money , just listen to biggies two gems and `` f '' the rest
1	once she has won your heart , you will want this collection to hear how she developed as a performer -- and came to be a great symbol of france in the 20th centur
0	i remember this album well ; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer ' , as it was released well before `` under the bridge '' made them the bandwagon band of the year , but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right -- they never had a good album . for every song worth listening to ( `` suck my kiss '' , `` give it away '' ) , there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded . this album was and remains a perfect example of why bands should n't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can . on top of that , the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief . some friends and i got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album , and kiedis was so off-key , it was n't funny . they drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals , but the damage was done . people were walking out in droves
1	this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts
0	the cd is great ! ! ! the legendary johnny cash comes thru loud and clear on this cd . however , it took amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them . their attitude of `` just wait a few more days and email us again '' was both insulting and annoying . thank goodness this was n't a christmas gift for someone .
1	del the funky homosapien has been my favorite mc for years , and this album does n't dissapoint . the dvd is raw , and packs in lots of live footage , interviews , and is well produced . if you are a fan of del , you know you have to pick this up .
1	i love this soundtrack ! it stands alone as beautiful , haunting , alluring , and innocent -- just as griet herself was in the film . desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story , enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar . scarlett johanssen 's acting is superb , as well as essie davis and colin firth . the story , though , was a bit tired -- pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband . its portrayal of vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people , even though it is a fictionalized account . the two best tracks on this album are 'griet 's theme ' and 'colours in the clouds ' . while i 'm not keen on seeing the film again , this soundtrack is a treasure . it 's a real work of art , second only to vermeer 's work
1	it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded ; i believe it is . but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , abbado , bernstein , chailly , haitink , horenstein , kubelik , nagano , olson [ colorado mahlerfest ] , solti , and tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , `` there . it 's out there . you ca n't see it , but you can divine it '' ( and call `` it '' what you will : `` god '' or `` love '' or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves ) . most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . the problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no longer a vision , it 's something mundane . in the closing pages of wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly begins to do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . you know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . and that 's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i 'm referring to here . so let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : the sound : spectacularly natural and all-encompassing . the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . the soloists : to a letter the finest group i have ever heard . there 's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler 's bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self-importance . no operatic grandstanding here . and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words ( no libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . they were n't going through the motions , making pretty sounds . they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . to be honest , part ii has often bored me to tears ( with chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . and throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . the choruses : easily the best i 've ever heard . the way they rip into `` hostem repellas longius '' with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the `` rabble '' section from the first movement of mahler 's third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . that 's nothing . i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated ! i have never experienced anything like that before . ever . and i do n't just mean while listening to music . the conductor : what can i say ? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . how ? i have no idea , but when the start of part ii does n't jar , as it usually does , you know you 're in for something special . maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing ) . the orchestra : while they do n't have the `` mahler sound '' that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler . to sum up , then , i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording , and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it , especially those radiant , visionary , and extraordinary closing pages . record of the year ; record of the century ! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music .
1	i heard this music on the excellent p b s documentary : `` liberty - the american revolution '' and i knew i had to have it ! it is the finest music i have heard , capturing the heart and soul of the american revolution . the documentary `` liberty '' was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving . so too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment . i love it ! i could hardly wait to get it in the mail . it framed the documentary ( which i also bought ) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting . superlatives fail me . this music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the american revolution and then by listening to it apart . this is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard . it reminds me of the genius of aaron copland who wrote the applachian spring and rodeo suites
1	this is one of my favorites of 2004 . you got a seasoned vet of an mc rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats ( madlib , j-zone , dangermouse ) and some pretty nice guest appearances . i have a couple of complaints on this album though , like the song `` love thang '' , the hook is wack and the beat is corny , another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got prince po sounding like tonto from lone ranger chanting some indian ish , and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like `` and if the girl farts then she 's a pooter '' ? ? ? thats dumb . one last complaint then i 'm done hatin , but the chorus on bump bump is terrible , and i 'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i 'm in my car because it sounds so wack , but raekwon 's verse takes me back to when wu tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90 's , which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus . aside from those complaints you got a dope album , j-zone hit this up with some of best beats i 've ever heard from him . so pick this up its definitely a good purchase
1	rock n ' roll history has many example of band/artists unlucky , that did n't get the recognition they deserve . here 's one . what is big star about ? a rock n ' roll , slightly psychodelic , most influenced by beatles and the byrds . the first record ( # 1 record - 1972 ) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop-rock tune after another . chilton gets the most rock stuff , chris the ballads , and also a contribution from hummel , the hippy `` india song '' . best moments : in the streets , thirteen , india song , when my baby 's beside me , my life is right . the second album - radio city - 1973 . chris left the band , claiming that chilton was getting too much control of everything . for this record , hummel contributes more , the band goes torward some stuff slightly different , like the soul intended o my soul ( maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere . chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction , the albm sounds not better or worse , but less laboured , sounding in some tracks , more like a rehearsal , with a great garage feeling . stevens goes great on drums , specally on back of a car . best tracks : way out west , life is white ( although the harmonica annoys me a little ) , mod lang ( very bowie mood ) , back of a car , september gurls . at a glance , big star reminds me backing home from school , playing my guitar , calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach . a feeling of youthness that does n't come back , just like those special moments in a band 's career that later , they ca n't catch anymore , no matter how hard they try . for big star , no differ , they would never do anything like these two records . and sadly after bell 's death , chances are zero to none . why did n't they succeeded . well , ego stuff , lack of stax knowledge to deal with rock n ' roll bands , and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n ' roll scene at the time : hard rock versus progressive rock . and what about big star ? neither hard rock , nor progressive . but , despite all that rubish , big star is pure rock n'roll , guitar band , 70 's style , recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world . big star is eternal .
0	if you are looking for boring , lifeless adult contemporary music , then this cd is for you . if you are looking for a great guitar cd , this is n't it . i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion , but all winning streaks must come to an end , and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this . of all the eric clapton cds that i like , this is n't one of them . i 'm glad clapton is now in a happy place ( and deservedly so ) , but this cd just does n't do it for me
0	i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that `` ... if you like sigur ros you will like mbv.. '' let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience . if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins , though i must be clear i do n't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser . it would be more palatable if the production value was higher ... .it sounds terrible . the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80 's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days ! ) .
0	great recording , but if you want to actually use it , like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm . meaning you ca n't . do n't buy sony products ! !
1	hayley westenra , at only 18 years old , is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come . this is an uplifting and at times , spiritual album that shows shades of greatness . throughout , westenra 's voice is captivating , though the musical scores are at times , sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent . there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated `` the female josh grobin '' , but i think a more accurate sentiment would be `` a young sarah brightman '' . odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes , all of which match up well with westenra 's abilities . bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet , dell amore non si sa . they pair up for that one song , but the rest is all westenra . this is smooth , soothing and easy listening . if you like brightman , you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra .
0	man , have i given this guy a chance . multiple chances . listened to the cds , saw the big hbo special . i mean , his career is red hot now . he clearly has lots of fans . mostly college age ( perhaps this should be a warning to some of you ) . all i can say is `` maybe they 'll grow out of it . '' he is not funny . his act has no bite , no point of view , no opinion/viewpoint at all . his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to ( the `` this is all happened to us '' or `` has this ever happened to you ? '' school of humor ) . he runs about manically , acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth ( for those in the audience that may not be so good with words ) . his fans acknowledge that , yes , they can relate . `` yeah ! that 's happened to me ! '' `` i know that reference ! ' they laugh , cheer , clap , and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit . he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent , interesting way . he has no edge . he 's not outraged by anything . he 's cute 'n ' cuddly . richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic . `` pryor ? the guy writing this must be old ! ' okay , try this on for size : chris rock is good comedy . same with dave chappelle . carlin . laura kightlinger . kinison . rodney dangerfield . bob saget . gilbert gottfried . dom irrera . lewis black . robert klein . the late mitch hedberg . jim norton . patton oswalt . brian posehn . degeneres . jon stewart . bob david . the ucb . i 'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman , but at least she 's trying to bring something different to the party . anything but this ! god help us . let 's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon ( do n't forget , cook fans , mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here )
1	i love `` fool for the city '' i have also always loved savoy brown `` looking in '' and did n't know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat . if you are a foghat fan you should check out `` looking in '' by savoy brown . if you 've heard other stuff by savoy brown and did n't like it , do n't be discouraged because `` looking in '' ( and only `` looking in '' ) is essentially foghat . there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best .
1	i heard the chairman dances and went right to amazon to order this . this ia a lovely little gem of a cd , and it is so pleasing to find john adams , another great modern american composer . i 'm also a fan of composers such as christopher rouse , for example , and joe leniado chira is my cousin . modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore , demand more of and nurture . we afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre . meanwhile , john adams has impressed me with this disc . the chairman dances is my favorite . i can just see chairman mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this , and tricky dick feeling jealous . this might be the music that opened china to the west
0	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations , but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak , the singing is weak , and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music -- the songs are not all the same , but for some reason they all sound the same -- and embarrassingly , you can sing most of them after one listen , they are so simplistic and cliched
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french . the music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing . steven halpern composes great music
