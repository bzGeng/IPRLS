It is an awesome CD with awesome songs. I recomend it to anyone who likes country music! I especially love his remake to Ty England's "I'll Take Today" very nicely done! hope to hear even more out of this great artist 
Out of all of his current albums he's released, easily Gary Allan's sophmore 1998 release IT WOULD BE YOU is my favorite. All his albums are great, but this one has so many great songs. The title track was a top 10 country hit, it's short but a great song overall with a killer chorus. The other singles included the ballad "I'll Take Today", which is touching and beautiful, and the bar romp on "No Man In His Wrong Heart". "Forgotten But Not Gone" is an excellent ballad, although sad, about a wife who is neglected and not appreciated. After there is a hidden bonus track titled "Judgement Day" which is another great song. There's some nice ballads like "Baby I Will", "I Ain't Runnin Yet", "She Loves Me, She Don't Love You", and more. There's also some great honky tonk real country songs like "Don't Leave Her Lonely Long", "Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies" and "I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket". A strong effort from the underrated Gary Allan 
This is a great cd like I said before, but I forgot to add one thing. The last song on this cd is listed as 11:'Forgotten, But Not Gone', but if you let it play there is a pause and another song comes on that's not listed on the cd. It's a great song. It made me cry when I heard it. Odd the title is not listed on the cd 
Love the songs on this cd. There's not one I don't like.My favorites are 'It Would Be You', 'Don't leave her lonely too long','I've got a quarter in my pocket', but like I said they're all great 
I really like this cd a lot, probably my second favorite of his only to Used Heart for Sale. It is great. Very catchy tunes, but also some great ballads. This man knows how to sing and be different from the standard country voice out there! A must-have for country fans 
Gary Allan skipped the sophomore slump with his second album, something that usually plagues new artists, but he seems comfortable on his 1998 album IT WOULD BE YOU. The album has the right balance between uptempo honky tonks and touching ballads. The album opens with the title track, one of his stronger singles. "No Man In His Right Heart" recounts a night where a man turns down a woman's offer, an offer no other man would refuse. "Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long" was co-written by Marty Stuart, its a fun honky tonk sure to please. "I'll Take Today" was another single from the album, a nice ballad about cherishing the time we spend in the present instead of relenting on the past. Other nice sentimental ballads include "I Ain't Runnin' Yet" and "Baby I Will", and he does honky tonk on "I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket" and "Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies". The album closes with "Forgotten But Not Gone", a beautiful ballad, one of the best on the CD. There's also a hidden track called "Judgement Day" which is worth listening to. Overall this is a nice album, I think better than his first, so give it a listen 
Gary Allan's sophomore effort is top notch material. IT WOULD BE YOU brings together all sorts of emotions together, into 12 cuts on the CD. I think Gary brings an element to country music which lacks in other male country singers, he's not afraid to be country, and he does it very well. There's some really top notch ballads here, such as "It Would Be You", "I'll Take Today", "Baby I Will", and more, as well as some honky tonks like "Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long", "Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies", "I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket" and more. Perhaps the most touching song is "Forgotten but Not Gone", which is just heartbreaking and delivered with every emotion it seems he has inside of him. There's also a hidden track called "Judgement Day". Overall IT WOULD BE YOU is a great album, a great follow up to USED HEART FOR SALE, just another great album in his growing collection 
I was on holiday in P.A.this September.Being British we dont listen to too much country and western and what we have is very commericial.So to sit and watch the counrty video channel was a new thing.When Gary Allen came on I was amazed at what a fantastic voice he has.As soon as i heard one song i went and got the CD "it would be you".I have played the CD over and over again.It just gets better everytime I hear it.The fact that he does it in a non commericial way and with feeling makes it so much better.This has to be the best album i have ever purchased and would recommend it to anyone that likes the songs written and performed with meaning and style 
Her voice is out of this world and will transport you to a complete peace of mind. Music to enjoy all the time 
I've reviewed a lot of new music, looking for something to put on my MP3 player for travel. I heard a song from this album on Pandora, and had to order it- Ms. Westenra is an excellent young singer, and I'll be looking for more from her 
Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent. There was an advertising tag on this CD that stated "The female Josh Grobin", but I think a more accurate sentiment would be "a young Sarah Brightman". ODYSSEY is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song, but the rest is all Westenra. This is smooth, soothing and easy listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the voice of Westenra. 
I was given Hayley Westnra's international debut CD "Pure" as a gift and though I immediately fell in love with her voice, I was not particularly fond of most of the songs. "Odyssey", however, is an amazing follow up. It's a wonderful mix of songs that run the gamut from older pop songs to classical music to a gospel tune! Prayer is a nice opening, but I love Both Sides Now, which was originally a Joni Mitchell song, and is an interesting choice for Hayley. It's great to see how she has matured as a singer-this song has such interesting lyrics and she does it so expressively. Never Saw Blue I absolutely ADORE, especially the first verse. It's so lovely to just hear her and the piano, and her voice is so moving throughout the song. Dell'Amore Non Si Sa is another great song with a really cool pulsing rythym. All three of these songs really show how she's grown in terms of emotional expression, and Dell'Amore... has the added bonus of being a duet with a very great singer, Andrea Bocelli. They sound wonderful together, and I love the instrumentals...though, to be fair, it's too bad that Hayley can be a little drowned out at the end of the song, under the instruments and Bocelli's amazingly powerful voice. What You Never Know is just a lovely song, as are May It Be and You Are Water. Quanta Qualia was a little odd...not my favorite. I loved She Moved Through the Fair: Hayley's voice and the pipe or flute that is the main instrument are a perfect match. I wish she would do more Celtic songs, since her voice is perfectly suited for them. My Heart Belongs To You is a little over the top for my taste, but the Ave Maria is beautiful and I love I Say Grace because it's just a really hopeful, happy song that Hayley does absolute justice to. It's funny because it has an almost gospel sound to it, and I would never have placed her as being able to do gospel really well, but it's perfect for her. This CD is just a joy to listen to and I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a really beautiful voice 
What's the point of packaging and repackaging a single album? Do these record execs think that us music buyers are so gullible that changing the album cover and adding a couple of 'new' tracks are going to make us buy a brand new cd? Well, I'm just not impressed with this girl's voice to buy 5 different Odyssey versions just for the sake of obtaining 5 extra songs. She has a pretty enough voice but it tends to be flat and far too pretty without real emotion behind it. Scarborough fair? What you never know? Sarah Brightman-esque much?? 
Since I live in south america, I didn't actually stumble across Hayley until a couple months ago, while surfing my recommendations at Amazon, and I'm glad I did. I was back then looking for something a l Sarah Brightman, and even when what I found wasnt actually like her, what I found happened to be excellent. Odyssey, Hayley's second international album comes in two versions, australian and US, and both are really great. The album generally has a really light feeling, which makes it really easy to get into it and helps it to grow on you. Though it doesnt follow a single style, like Mrs. Brightman's albums do, Odyssey becomes a single piece really easily and fast, and you'll find yourself easily listening to it over and over. Here is a track-by-track review, comparing both versions: 1-Prayer: A great opening, though it takes abit for it to grow into you. However, once it does you simply won't want to stop listening to it. Also, Hayley's angelical voice serves as a great intro to the album in this song. Not the best one in the album, but surely a really great one. 2-Both Sides Now: Really great song, talks about life and experience. I couldn't love this song any less even if I wanted to. 3-Never Saw Blue: Great song, a bit like Both Sides Now, Hayley shows her vocal strenght and beauty while singing sweet lyrics that could easily touch anyone's heart. 4-Dell'Amore Non Si Sa (Duet with Andrea Bocelli): Another excellent song, Hayley sings softly the verses while Bocelli enters with the chorus, a great great song featuring 2 of the greatest crossover singers. 5-What You Never Know (Won't Hurt you): An excellent song, a cover from Sarah Brightman's "What You Never Know" which indeed beats the original song. It has two versions, depending on the album you have. Though Hayley's voice is essencially the same in both, the arrangements are different: US: Nice composition, background music uses strings and soft music. AUS: Almost acapella, some echoes. I love them both, and personally couldnt choose only one of them. 6-May It Be (From "The Fellowship Of The Ring"): Another cover, this time from Enya, it does really well with some strenght, and delivers an unique feeling of duty to the listener. I won't compare it with the original recording by enya simply because I do not own enya's "May It Be" single or the LOTR album, so it would not be fair. However, the song lives up to the standars of the original one, and fits really well on the album. Hayley here prooves her voice is not only high-pitched soprano, but can also be turned down to an alto tone. 7-Quanta Qualia: I don't actually like this song, and it earns the price for the weakest song on the US album (Not on the AUS one). Its mainly a choir singing along with Hayley, and it becomes easily repetitive and boring. 8-You Are Water [Only on the US release]: Excellent song, infact the song why I think the US release is better than the US one. It starts with some quiet acoustic strings, and then Hayley comes in with a soft voice, giving a great vibe to the song. Beautiful love song, possibly one of the best songs in the album. The AUS version also had its proper song, which is reviewed in the end of this review. 9-She Moves Through The Fair: Beautiful song, originally an european folk song. It says a short tale, its pretty quiet yet its great, look for the bagpipes in it, they give a huge boost to the song. Not the best in the album, but worth it. 10-My Heart Belongs To You: AUS version's final song, this one is probably the strongest love song I've heard in quite a while. Quiet verses, quickly followed with a slightly upbeat chorus, all of it sung with a really emotional tone. The version of the song differs between US/AUS, though both are really worth it: US version: More orchestal, the violins bend almost perfectly with the music, constantly overlapping it. AUS version: Less orchestal, though still an excellent one. Its more vocal driven, just as all the AUS version. 11-Ave Maria: A classic song, not much to be said. Same in both versions of the album. Hayley does a great job, and the song has a great orchestation, but it simply can't stand against others in the album, specially since Hayley's voice isn't really classical-driven, in contrast to Sarah Brightman's. Not too good, not too bad, a song that simply exists. 12-I Say Grace: a mainly vocal composition, it isn't bad though its clearly not the strongest song on the album, and a dissapointing way to end the US album, so I'd stay with the AUS track order, which had allthe same tracks but one (and also added an extra one not on the US version), and ended beautifully with "My Heart Belongs To You". Not a particularly good song, but not a bad one. Listenable and pleasant, but I can't really get used to its general beat. - Bachianas Brasileiras No.5 Aria (Cantilena)[AUS Version only]: In my opinion, the weakest track in the AUS version of the album (Which would explain why it got replaced for "You Are Water", an infinitely better track, in the US version). I've never got used to it, so this track is infact the one that could render the AUS version inferior to the US one, along with the price (US one is, naturally, much cheaper, not being an import) 
You will not be disappointed! Once again Hayley holds true to her extraordinary gift. I have never heard any other artist with such perfect command of voice. From the first song of this CD through the last it's a listening state of bliss. The only disappointment is that there are not 20 more tracks!!!so we'll just have to wait for the next CD release.. 
My wife dragged me kicking and screaming to the Il Divo concert in San Francisco, but when Hayley Westenra opened with "She Moves Through the Fair," my resistance had completely melted away. That song resonated throughout my soul. She also sang "Both Sides Now" and "May It Be" at the concert, along with a number of songs which are not on Odyssey." This 18-year-old has the ability to make me weep and make my knees grow weak with her "voice of an angel," it is so soft and pure and technically perfect. As Hayley continues to mature, she will find the perfect genre for her voice. Odyssey mixes styles from traditional Irish to Gospel to Joni Mitchell, and she does them all to perfection. But as a suggestion - and this not a criticism of the album - I would love to hear an album that is totally focused on the Celtic theme. Those are the songs that "grabbed" me the most. Thank you, Hayley! 
Regarding Sting's latest release, I absolutely love it. Having listened to and performed music by John Dowland for nearly 20 years I was fully expecting to be disappointed. I stand corrected. Upon reading the CD booklet one understands that there is no pretense or hubris here at all. It is clear that it is presented with a great deal of humility and love. Criticism on this point is completely without warrant. As one reviewer wrote, this is clearly a labor of love and this listener believes the CD must be viewed as a whole work in itself. As a "musical soundtrack" to the composer's life this CD hits the mark squarely on the bullseye. While I am a huge fan of prior Dowland recordings of "legitimate" early music specialists, I love the rawness of Sting's voice on these songs and Karamazov's lute playing here is fantastic. Beautifully unpretentious. Personal taste varies widely and many fans of Sting's pop side surely will not appreciate it. While this CD is also not for the pretentious, condescending listener with little or no imagination, for those with an open mind, who are willing and able to put aside their presuppositions, it will not disappoint. The fact that this CD has evoked such strong opinions might perhaps speak volumes as to its artistic value. Sting and Edin Karamazov have succeeded not only in creating a wonderful recording, but also in artistically recreating an entire world. The songs, the letters, the ambience, this listener has no complaints. 
The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet. It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure. 
When I heard that Sting was coming out with a new collection of music, I tried to stop my giddy grin, and went on and preordered it. When I opened it up, I was hit with a bit of surprise. For one, it was released on the Deusche Grammophon label, which usually devote themselves to classical works. Looking closer I saw that it was not an array of pop songs, but rather a review of the works of John Dowland. Oh boy, am I in for an adventure! I thought and eager ripped off the packaging and into the cd player it goes. I was enchanted right from the start. The singing is wonderful, there was only one really bad track, and even Sting reading from one of Dowland's letters to an influential courtier at James I's court was interesting. There's a haunting quality to the songs, music written by a man who was an outsider in the land of his birth (Dowland was a catholic in a fiercely protestant England), and from what the letter tell us, a man who was living on the edge between being comfortable and poverty. Not all of the songs are great, and there are several real clunkers in this -- for me, I detested listening to Can she excuse my wrongs? but several others are haunting in their beauty and touch of melancholy. Slipped in between the musical selections is Sting reading from a letter of Dowland's, written in 1595, to an influential courtier in Queen Elizabeth's court, and Dowland is hoping that he can gain the patronage of Lord Robert so that he can gain employment and return to England. While at first, it feels odd to have the readings in there, but eventually you get a cohesiveness that makes Dowland's story all the more poignant. The liner notes contain the text of the letter, song lyrics, an extensive essay from Sting talking about how he came to the music of Dowland and his study of the lute, and its bigger brother, the archlute. Several photographs are included as well, and the design is very beautiful throughout. No, it's not a perfect album. Very few are, and there are always several clunkers it seems, and this one is no different. However, for sheer exhurberance, I give this one a solid five stars -- it's bold, it's something new, and I do have to applaud Sting for getting out there and stepping out of his role as a pop icon and trying something new. No, not everyone is going to like it. Quite a few will hate this one, but if you want to hear music of the Renaissance performed by a masterclass musician, go on and give this one a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. 
This is my first exposure to the Lute and the excellent song writing of John Dowland. I think Songs from the Labyrinth (Music by John Dowland) by Sting is a really exceptional CD. There is a sometimes eerie, often joyous, but always unique feel to this great CD. There are a few standout offerings, for me Come, heavy sleep, is one of the true highlights. Truth be told, I am only a casual Sting fan, however, my appreciation of him has grown with this outing. The experience is that of watching an educational movie, you learn while you enjoy. This is a great exposure to a different sound and instrument, as well as a harkening back to centuries past. I highly recommend this 4 star CD 
Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco 
Upon first hearing I wasn't sure I liked this CD, but after the second time, I was hooked! The only thing I'm not sure of is the spoken word sections by Sting. They seem to break the spell a bit, but I understand that Sting is trying to put things in context for us. Despite this, I really love the selections; the lute is fabulous and Sting's interpretations are quite lovely... he is such a romantic, so that they are really befitting of him. My favorite selection is "Come Again" and "Clear or Cloudy" is nice also. "In darkness let me dwell" is a bit dark but an appropriate ending to the disc. This is great listening for an elegant Christmas brunch, save the spoken sections. 
John Dowland's music is not something that the majority of people can easily digest. I do not say this in an effort to elevate elitism, or to make people flee from this album...but the cold truth is that most people are not ready to hear classically trained voices. This is no shame. The classically trained voice is an acquired taste; once acquired, however, it can be difficult to return to an enjoyment of the untrained voice. This album, then, seems an effort doomed to a failure of the "High jump, low ceiling" variety. However, those who are open are going to be surprised and pleased. First, to the pop/rock crowd. Sting is not singing Sting songs here. But if you love that smoky quality to Moon over Bourbon Street, if you love the late night feel of "Why should I cry for you?", if you are enchanted by his quieter moments, then this album is exactly for you. The above comparisons are not meant to imply that this is a jazzy or world beat album... just to imply that the same intimacy that you get from some of his previous songs is here in spades. The lute is a lovely instrument, not hard on the ears, similar enough to the classical guitar in tone to use it as a starting reference point. The music here is flexible and beautiful, and you just might find yourself addicted to the melancholy wonder that is John Dowland's poetry, and the lovely, decelptively simple melodies that he weaves in and out of the lute. TO the classical crowd--Sting has never claimed to be a great voice from a classical perspective. Nor do I think that his readings of these songs would stand up to a classical contest judge. What you get here, however, is a heart felt, lovely, raw interpretation of this complex material. THis is your John Dowland's best friend singing the songs to himself. This is a classical musician's brother who can't get the melodies and music out of his mind. And when you listen to it, there is a freshness and charm to his lack of training that make this a complete success in the same vein of "Weep ye No More, sad fountains" when it was sung by Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. Was Jane Eaglen's version of the song more perfect? Yes. Was it more lovely? That is debateable. If you know what I am talking about in that last comparison, and if you have spent years searching for Kate's version, then this album is for you. Listen to it with friends, without pretension, and watch them be surprised by it. Oh, but it looses the last star because of hte needless addition of the letter reading. Nothing is wrong with Sting's readings, but they don't add much to the album. 
Please, open your minds, cause Sting has done it on his latest work. Hear it with your souls, and let your spirits flow... After I've heard this album, I couldn't believe in all the beauty that I felt on the sound of Sting's voice and the lute, a precious instrument. I'm a 43 old brazilian woman and know a little bit of middle age music, and this cd is something new and magic: his voice [the voice of our times], and the work of Dowland just the way he wrote it. What's wrong with the people that gave just one star on the rate, and says "it's not the Sting we know"? Come on! I, myself, love the work of Sting as a whole, and must say that he really had the guts to do this beautiful work. We all know that probably it won't sell as much as the pop cds [it's a pity...], but I just LOVED IT. Congratulations Sting !! 
While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely. Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations. The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly "note-for-note" in its approach. To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close "pop" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible. Add to this Sting's hokey "Masterpiece Theatre"-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable. In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer. I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week 
This is simply embarrassing. Sting has recently taken to passing himself off as a classical musician, playing guitar and lute and singing. He can do none of these above the amateur student level. Only someone with an incredible lack of taste and a huge ego would attempt such a musical endeavor for anyone beyond his own edification. But then to place it on a disc and ask people to pay money for it just bursts the bounds of meretriciousness. He should have stuck to the same tired old reworkings of the one modal folk-new-age-trash song that he has based his solo career upon. And he should change his name to "Scat," for this more closely identifies with the brown, odoriferous material on this album 
I heard so many positive things from the other music lovers in my life, I finally had to sit down and listen to Beck's new album. I love it when a great artist not only puts out new music, but ensures that it is something fresh and exciting. 
Back when I was insane about Beck he was a folk-rap-punk-garage rocker, who in my ears did just about everything right up until about 1998. I think his last great album came out in X-mas of that year. It was Mutations, and little did we know, Beck was going en-route to being a staight up funkateer, electro music, space cadet.. (ok, maybe we knew a little... but he also went en-route to some sort of easy-elevator-dentist office sound that was a little too odd for me.) Well, he's come back to us, full circle. This time around on THE INFORMATION he has ensembled a band, that plays a few good old fashioned instruments, like the half fked up electric guitar, the half broken acoustic guitar, some cups and dishes, and a gameboy rigged to become a musical instrument. Now I have enjoyed Beck through pretty much every phase of his career, but I have gotsta say that I have missed his more gutsy tunes for some time. Theres a good chunk of raw, mind bending tunes in this package. There is still a few of the more sugary style tunes too, but all together they work pretty well. The top three for me are NASEAU (this song would have been much better though had it been expanded by a few more minutes of the crazy rhythm break down- instead it just ends out of nowhere) then theres CELLPHONES DEAD- funky... and 1000BPM, great garage sound on that one. The disc also contains alot od=f sixties pop rock numbers, that work well in some spots, and not so well in others. BUT- the kicker here, and the reason I award five stars, is the incredibly trippy, and visually brilliant DVD. We get a whole collage of colors, costumes, beautiful women (in costumes), and spacey images to blow the mind. I could watch that thing over and over-its wicked. Beck still is brilliant, and plenty of people seem to be on par with his material these days. I love the raw sounds that he made his name on back in the day-day, and I'm glad to say that theres plenty of rock and roll madness in this madness. Plus theres stickers 
Back after 6 years with a new album. Beck's kickin' us into the stratosphere with some flux-infused, funk inducing, space-age, freaky hi-fi freak jams! We needed this! The scientology and the depression fall to the back seat, makin' out with a dodo bird like that! Check! the videos are the most amazing spectacle since the Mellow Gold videos. Some fools come incorrect insisting that Beck sounds like Beck and that this is bad. But Beck has always sounded like Beck, in case you haven't noticed. Should he make a BB King record? no. And he already did that Kenny G thing. That's done, like 6 years ago. Sea Change was amazing, but it didn't fill the Beck related needs in those special ways. Guero couldn't hold the hype of the 8-bit remixes... this comes as the real deal. Better times are coming our way! And it'd plenty fun to make your collage artwork 
Awesome Beck CD Except for the single Nausea. The worst song on the CD was made a single, how awful. The CD slightly falls apart towards the end, but never gets as bad as that song. I've been saying for years (faith no more had a sticker placed in the King for a Day album) to do the sticker thing (but who am I?), to give the consumer a reason to buy a cd again. Aren't you sick of buying CD's and getting a one page booklet!?! Beck Fixed all that and I found myself entranced with his old school videos too. THANK YOU BECK 
I'll have to say, I find it odd that Beck's getting so much love from the Amazon reviewers about his latest dud, The Information. Some of it sounds alright, but NONE of it sounds fresh or inspired. If it was put out by anyone else, I'd give it three stars; but I expect more from Beck. There's not much to say about this boring, underwhelming platter. It almost seems like it was created by a focus group, cooked up to sound like a Beck CD. But Beck's longtime fans know that Beck's CDs never used to sound like Beck CDs -- in other words, he's become predictable and safe. What a Snoozer. Beck has clearly jumped the shark 
Beck returns with his shortest interval between albums and "The Information". Just 18 months after the excellent "Guero", "The Information" is seemingly a more muted affair. Long in terms of 15 tracks and 60 minutes of music, and rather less adventurous than "Guero". Still, Beck tends to get more things right than wrong and there are a plethora of songs that are above average with only one song truly standing out from the rest--"Cell Phone's Dead", which should be the next single. "Nausea" is also good, along with "Think I'm In Love", "Soldier Jane", "New Round", "Dark Star" and "The Information". After repeated listens, the album is better than it first seemed, but at 60 plus minutes it's a strain to make to the end in one sitting. The art concept consisting of stickers to make your own album art is brilliant. The extra dvd with videos for all the songs on "The Information" is an added bonus with hits and misses. Overall, "The Information" is informative, but not as useful as "Guero" or "Odelay" 
Beck might be the coolest and greatest creative musical genius of our generation. What's so cool about Beck is that his music is always different and interesting and so hard to pinpoint. It's rock, alternative, folk, hip-hop, jazz, lo-fi and so many other things with lyrics that make no sense but are just awesome. He travels through so many musical dimensions. Sometimes his music is serious and heartfelt (i.e. his 2002 album "Sea Change"), other times it's crazy and strange (i.e. his 1994 album "Stereopathic Soulmanure"). His new album "The Information" has a little of everything. Since Beck's breakthrough in 1994 with his hit single "Loser" and creating an amazing (major label) sophomore album "Odelay" (with his other radio staple "Where it's At (I got two turntables and a microphone)", a new Beck album is always something to look forward to. And "The Information" is definitely worth the wait I've been craving. It might not be his best album ("Odelay" will probably never be topped, (although some fans agree 2005's "Guero" is a close second)). But it is definitely an album which will spin my head for a month or two. Something very creative and cool about this CD is what it comes with. The album comes with 2 discs, one is a CD that has all the tracks on it and the other is a DVD with all the tracks which all have music videos. Although, all the videos are alike (basically Beck and bunch of people he knows (his son, wife, friends etc.) are behind a green screen with different effects). The CD also comes with a customizable album cover. Each CD has a set of stickers, you can place anywhere you want on the CD booklet which is a blank canvas. As for the music, most of the songs are a bit slow but all have a cool groove to them especially "Think I'm in Love," Strange Apparation," "Solider Jane," "Nausea," "We Dance Alone," and "The Information" . The 15 track hour long album has a vive most people can never get into, unless you're a Beck fan. Beck isn't an artist everyone can relate to (except for some of his hit singles (i.e. "Loser", "Where It's At", "E-pro") but for that small percentage of people in the world who love Beck, this album will groove your mind. There are a lot of weird but very cool little things throughout the album that only Beck would think of to include in his music. For example, in "Cellphone's dead", the chorus has Beck singing then you hear someone who sounds like a 12 year kid sing "One by one I'll knock you out." And of course, the lyrics are crazy but genius i.e. "No Complaints/But I wish I had my top of my brain/I'd like to walk/but the sun doesn't know we're awake). A lot of the tracks have a Mellow Goldness (Beck's debut album) to them. Others resemble Midnight Vultures (his 1999 album). And some tracks are like something Beck's never released before. There's two tracks that really stand out above the rest, track 2 "Think I'm in love" and his current single "Nausea. 
i have literally been listening to this work for a week straight. when i get in my car, i turn it on. when i'm at home, i put on the DVD and watch it over and over and over again. it's brilliant. it's sick. i'm wondering if there is some sort of Scientologist subliminal messaging going on or something. why can't i stop? how can one work be so addictive? since the second that i heard the first note, i knew that this was something incredible. EVERY song is amazing. who cares who invented what, or who did what first. sometimes it's the person who rediscovers something, and puts a new spin on it, that makes it more relevant and powerful than it might have been in its previous incarnation. Beck's translation and redefining of these genres brings rap, folk, and electronic music to a sublime level that has never been reached before, by any of their founding fathers. Beck is the pale horseman of the mundane music apocalypse; The Information is a product of music's re-evolution 
First of all, concerning the guy who said that Beck is ripping off rappers from 20 years ago, Well, It's like comparing a Model T with a new Lexus. They may have invented rap 20 years ago but it was in a raw form. (Actually, Rapper's Delight from 1979 was the start and that was quite good). Beck has refined with subtle nuances and sonic innovation the art of pop culture. Whether it's rap, rock, pop, Brazilian Tropicalia, folk etc., you can count on Beck never being boring. This album ranks up there with his best. I listened to it for the first time yesterday and came away with the idea that in 2025, this will probably sound like everyday music. Right now, I'm hearing snippets of that on some TV commercials. Even Barbara, my wife, sat up and took notice and said "How come we don't hear this on the radio, down here?" Every song on this CD is different and innovative. Beck is a production genius. Just buy it! You won't be dissapointed. 
i picked up JL's cd last friday. after get lifted, it was a no-brainer that i'd be getting the cd sight (and sound) unseen on 10/24...until i heard "save room". gotta admit, it threw me off a little. i'm going to his concert this friday, so i decided to go ahead and brush up on the new album anyway. first time i listened to it....UGGGGGGGHH! what happened to the JL we all knew and loved? but a funny thing happened. as i continued to listen to the cd, certain songs started to jump out at me. granted this wasn't til the end of the cd, so i didn't get to them til the next day, (i mean there's only so much frustration a person can take at once, i couldn't listen to the whole cd the first day). give it another listen and i think you'll appreciate the unique sound of this album. but first (!) remove your "get lifted" ears and dispose of all the preconceived notions that pop radio has instilled in us. this is definitely not r, but it's still great music and gifted songwriting. JL draws from a lot of different genres for this album ranging from soft rock, to old school soul and r, to some cabaret-type entries. songs like "slow dance", "each day gets better and "where did my baby go" are catchy enough although very different (even from each other). "stereo" has a kind of modern/slightly funky feel to it and "show me" is positively haunting with its hushed guitar and JL's floating falsetto. "again" (my fave and this album's "ordinary people"), "another again", and "coming home" are heartbreakingly real songs and have earned repeated spins on my player. ironically, the first two singles ("save room" and "heaven") although listen-able are not among my favorites on the cd, but you have to give it up to the artist for the gutsy departure from standard radio fare. it took a little while longer than normal, but by sunday night this album had taken over the #1 spot on my playlist. 
Wooow!!! I got no words to describe this amazing album, got nothing but respect for a young artist who dares to take too much risk by offering a uncommon style in an area where kids dictate what's good or bad music. Unlike Jamie Foxx who had to bring an entire group of Hip Hop stars on his album "Unpredictable", John Legend chose to take a different route and hence, he felt there was no need to call T.I, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z or G-Unit crew to succeed. Dude decided to drive innovative genre, and the result is GREAT. This less reliance on guests itself shows the level of maturity and confidence this artist has got. After the phenomenal success of his first album "Get Lifted" and the Grammies he took home, I thought he was going to bring back the same formula just to please the masses but instead of selling clichï¿½s, Mr. Soul took a risk and came up with this 60's music style vibe and people who were expecting another "Get lifted" were a bit surprised by the absence of up-tempo tracks like "Number One" or "I can change". Once Again sounds like it was released 20 years before "Get lifted" and this reflects in the 60s music style with acoustic guitars, the piano, the musical arrangement and the strong vocals especially with the following tracks: "Save Room", created by the producer ï¿½ la mode Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas, this lead single has got a touch of 70's R and the more I listen to it, the more I become addicted. "Show me": Produced by the undefeatable Raphael Saadiq (D'Angelo, Mary J Blige, Tony Toni Tonï¿½, Lucy Pearl). John begs and beseeches with such a soulful and smooth voice. This is the one of best tracks on the album and Legend's favorite. "Each Day Gets Better": Each kiss gets sweater... deeper and deeper. Enough said, guys buy this album and juslisen to the modern Shakespeare. "Again": Just another ordinary people! He's still one of the best songwriters of his generation. "Where Did My Baby Go": Amazing lyrics, superb song, outstanding performance. I can predict another Grammy for Best Male R Vocal Performance with such a melancholic and juicy voice. This is by far my favorite song. "Waiting on you": This has got some Hip hop touch. Waiting on you has a nice beat and some good raps. "Heaven": If you've heard Ordinary people then no need of further explanation... "We just don't care/PDA": always laugh whenever I listen to "let's get lifted" and with this track he just makes me laugh again ... "Ooh, we'll take a visit to your Mama's house, Creep to the bedroom while your Mama's out, Maybe she will hear it when we scream and shout, And we will keep it rocking until she comes knocking.... ". "Maxine": This another U remind me song with a jazzy flavor and wonderful lyrics: ....You should've seen the way she wore her dress, And her white stiletto shoes, you should've seen the way they looked on her, just like the ones that I bought you, I searched for days on end to no avail, 'Till I found them in Peru...Maxine, she looks just like you..." There is no doubt, Mr. Soul is reinventing R and the way he's pushed limits beyond the usual and familiar sounds and this without caring what people might think, shows he's really walking in the shoes of Marvin Gaye as Quincy Jones himself agreed. Bravo John, you're now undeniably a LEGEND 
To be honest, I was skeptical of this album when I heard about it and the first time I listened to it I didn't think as much of it as I do now. The reason I think I rejected it at first is because of how different it is to "Get Lifted" but when I began to listen to it more it shows its true worth. As a sophomore effort it is exactly what Legend needed in that it shows his maturation and growth as an artist. The singing is beautiful and the songs are much deeper than those on his first effort. This album advances John's career in a way that I very much appreciate. The music is more organic and more soulful than his earlier works. This isn't to take away from "Get Lifted" because it is also a must have. I just find this disc to be a good listen first track to last 
Plain and simple: this is a great album, get it! Its a waste of time analyzing it track for track, the only thing you can do is listen through and enjoy A fun, mature, and soulful collection of songs -- John wasn't dubbed 'Legend' for nothin 
This CD is easy to like because it is tastefully done. Mix Motown, The 5 Stairsteps and Jimi Hendrix and what you get is a collection of songs that will stand the test of time. My favorite track is #5. Track #1 could use a little umph, but other than that, this is a very solid piece of work. 
I have his first cd, which I got earlier this year. I was interested in how he sounded since he is from the town I lived in for several years, Springfield, Ohio. I liked it, but like this one better. I am going to only center this on my favorite song, Coming Home. I am a musician, having a college degree in music. I am 62, don't get emotional over very many songs. But, Coming Home really hit me to the point I thought my breathe heart were stopping. I cried have with each hearing of it. It is beautiful, in my opinion. It's good to hear something that is new so good. 
In 2005 John Legend won 3 Grammy Awards. He won for Best New Artist, Best Male R Vocal Performance on his song "Ordinary People" and Best R Album for Get Lifted. Both of Legend's albums have been released under Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label. Get Lifted was a great album, but I think Once Again is better. 01. Save Room As the music starts, don't be startled. You are still sitting on your couch, or driving your car. You have not been physically transported to inside an elevator, it is just the song and it will pass. But before you know it you'll want to be sure you have someone in your life into whose eyes you may gaze while you sing along. 02. Heaven There is comfort in John Legend's voice and it comes through in this song. I am not a huge fan of the hollow, tin sounding female support singing "Heaven only knows," but it works well enough. 03. Stereo My guess is that you will be hard-pressed to find a song where you can feel the singer's passion like you can in this song. Listening to this song and this album you, too, will fall in love with your stereo. 04. Show Me While pleading for someone to show him that they love him, Legend shows us how comfortable he is in his upper vocal range. 05. Each Day Gets Better This is the track you will want to take not of on this album. This should be the new relationship anthem. Guys, if you don't get a copy of the album, at least get this song. If your girl has out grown the legend Barry White, try this Legend's "Each Day Gets Better." 06. P.D.A. (We Just Don't Care) This is really the first track on the album where we see the rusty sound in Legend's voice that delighted so many in the Grammy winning "Ordinary People," though it is in short supply. It comes out more later in the album. Gents, this is another track with which to woo your special lady friend. 07. Slow Dance Smooth. Let's drop everything so our arms are free for each other. It's a great message and a great song. 08. Again This song slows the album; it changes the pace and the tone. The first song with conflict in the lyrics is just another way for John Legend to show his versatility on the album. 09. Maxine The jazzier sound here could make this a song you would hear in a more up-scale bar/club/restaurant. It's a good song with a slower tempo. 10. Where Did My Baby Go This is probably my favorite song on the album. It is not the most up-beat subject matter, but it is one of the higher-energy songs. Probably the highest compliment I could pay John Legend is saying that this song is reminiscent of Sam Cooke. It also brings back that rusty, off-key singing that Legend does so well. I love this song. 11. Maxine's Interlude I am not sure why this was added to the album, except for dramatic feel to this story-told-in-an-album. At under 2 minutes, it is not too obtrusive, but I still usually skip this track when I listen to the album. 12. Another Again This is a good song. It is a shame that is on this album because it is overshadowed by so many of the other songs. And maybe if you haven't heard "Prototype," from OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, you won't mind how similar the music is. 13. Coming Home This is a beautiful song with which to end this story. There is more emotion here than in most of the other tracks, which makes sense as the album/story comes to its grand conclusion. 
this new disc gets a 4 because this cd apeases the more older crowd. where as, his first cd, all ages could relate to it. though this cd is good the first was and is bette 
This album is like the gift that keeps on giving or a fine wine that continues to mature, revealing further layers of texture and beauty over time. The only reason I can understand any disappointment is because Mr. Legend bravely departed from straight up, hook driven, hip hop tracks like "Used to Love You", the absence of which will disappoint "the kids" (mid thirties over here). I actually adore the aforementioned song, but with "Once Again" we are witnessing the earliest evolutions of a once in a generation artist. Confident in his longevity, Mr. Legend forgoes any safe choices, challenging the convention of what is considered popular music. Moreover, it is all done with utter class, exemplified by sure handed execution. For someone who so boldly and successfully eschews conformity, there is not a single whiff of self-congratulatory muck. There is no end-zone celebration necessary; Legend has been there before, and he'll be back again many times in the future. Thank you for this, JL 
John's second effort is more than just G.O.O.D. its GREAT! When I first heard Once Again I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as "Each Day Gets Better", "Slow Dance" and "Where Did My Baby Go", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like "Stereo", "Again" and "Another Again". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with "Heaven" and "Show Me". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won't soon forget 
Many songs could be singles hits. I listen from beginning to end almost every time 
I had asked a few people about the album, and was told that "Dirty Little Secret" and "Move Along" were the only real highlights of the album, so I was a little skeptical. Eventually, I figured I would give it a try and I bought it. I found that all the songs were just as good as the singles, and I don't regret my purchase. If you were intrigued by the singles, then you'll probably be satisfied with the rest of the album 
I bought this CD for two main reasons - "Dirty Little Secret" and "Move Along." After sampling the tunes I found myself liking a few others and so I took the plunge and bought this CD. This album has been getting lots of play on my CD player these days. The songs are totally addicting! I'm especially hooked on the following tracks: Dirty Little Secret (full of energy, loads of fun) Move Along (love it!! I repeat it over and over again, it's insane! My kids also love it because of its excellent beat. It is also featured in the "She's the Man" movie/dvd and "Bionicle" tv commercials so it's been getting lots of attention lately) It Ends Tonight (nice, soft, ballad) Straitjacket Feeling (has a strong 'emo' rock feel) I'm Waiting (another fast, energetic tune) Can't Take It (slower, more ballad-like) Most of tunes are full of energy and are a blast to listen to. A couple have a slower beat and feel more like 'emo' rock. There is not one song in this album that I dislike. Overall, it's an excellent CD. Many of the tunes will stick with you and you'll find yourself humming them over and over. I usually don't buy CDs unless I like several of the songs in the album and this one is definitely one of those rare ones. It's a keeper and one that my whole family actually enjoys 
This is a great recording which contains at least five of TEF's best western songs. I've always love western music. My favorites are Marty Robbins, Frankie Laine, TEF, and Tex Ritter 
It does not even sound like Ford and the socalled hits I never heard before and I am old enough to have heard all his hits 
Lovely Cd.Excellent songs.Shame it does not have The watermelon song/one suit.Got hold of these songs recently.The watermelon song especially is excellent. VK Oxford U 
Prince's 1980 album DIRTY MIND is one of his best albums from his decades long career. The album features a more stripped back production, but the music is still pure soul/funk. There are some really memorable, classic Prince jams here such as "When You Were Mine", "Head", "Uptown" and the title track. It's a brisk album at 8 songs, but all are integral to this album. Prince produced, arranged and composed the whole album. He found success starting with this cd, his third. Deservingly so, this is a classic album that may be his best album 
"Dirty Mind" shows how, even this early in his career, Prince was a genius when it came to straddling the line between the underground and the mainstream. On the cover Prince, clad in bikini underwear, trench coat and bandana, looks like he might have just left an S bar. But most of the songs on the album aren't nearly as outrageous as you'd expect from the cover. Musically, the album is a fairly straightforward blend of R, disco and synth-pop. Although the demo quality of the tracks does gives it a raw, unpolished edge. Maybe in 1980 the lyrics to tracks like "Do It All Night" and "Dirty Mind" were shocking, but they seem downright tame today. Lyrically, only the incestuous "Sister" still has the power to raise eyebrows. Overall, I'd say "Dirty Mind" is an interesting album that shows the early stages of Prince's musical experimentation and evolution 
Dirty Mind is, without a doubt, the best album the little guy has ever put out. A 40 minute tour de force, to the uneducated elitist it sounds like a mess of shallow lyrics and Casio keyboard demos. However, open your heart to the album and you'll soon grow to love it and wonder why Prince doesn't sing in falsetto more. It's interesting that once of the most accessible and danceable albums I've ever heard is in fact an ode to perversion and just general sketchiness. With song topics from relations with his sister to coercing a virgin on her wedding day for fellatio, Prince is in full horn dog mode here, folks. However, the album seems to harness the power of that raging sexuality and put it to a beat, creating music that would be a guilty pleasure if it weren't so darn good. Instantly shifting into gear, the album starts with the title track, a robotic funk workout that might be the greatest song Prince has ever recorded, if you ask me. Slowly building upon itself, the song develops into layers and layers of pounding synthesizer beats, Prince crooning every note in his highest voice possible. The two other highlights of the album are 'Head' and 'When You Were Mine', the former an infectious disco funk beat, the latter a new wave/bubblegum rocker. As Prince's production values grew along with his fanbase, he will probably never record anything else like Dirty Mind. Almost brilliant in it's minimalist nature, the album has a stripped down nature that no popoular musician would have the guts to make today. A short, yet sweet collection of 8 songs, it is essential that any fan of Prince, nay, fan of contemporary music in general has it in their collection 
Do you like Foucault? Do you like James Brown? If you don't own a Prince album, get this now!!!! "When You Were Mine" has to be the coolest breakup song every recorded, and all the rest of the songs are as good. THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THIS ALBUM! The sort of aesthetic Prince is preaching here isn't heard too much nowadays, which is sad. Every zeitgeist has its prophet, and Prince definitely saw the 80s in all its glory and perversity 
Whne I was in High school in the late 70s and early 80s, we eagerly awaited the yearly release of new Prince Albums (as the overall state of R was so dismal at the time). This was one of his most, er.."interesting" ones. Quite shocking for 1980-81. He actually sings of the "joys" of incest with "Sister" and "Head," well, that speaks for itself. The title tune and "Do It All Night" were not so hot. "Party Up" was quite raw for it's antiwar chant near the end (considering that the US was not actually involved in any war at the time). The original album had a nice poster of Prince's original band that would be later known as the Revolution. It's interesting also to consider that while the kids who listened to this in 1980-81 upset their parents by listening to "Dirty Mind", these very same kids are now upset over THEIR kids' rap cds. Go figure 
Prince's first two albums are good, but they don't exactly sound like the Prince that we all know. There's something kind of generic about them. With his third album, Dirty Mind, Prince finds his sound and ability to shock. The album is legendary for its shocking songs about oral sex incest, but the most shocking thing is how the music must have sounded at the time. A blend of rock funk Dirty Mind was the most exciting of each of those types of music. Dirty Mind is actually the demo tapes of the album. Prince was told by Warner Brothers that they should release them as is. This gave the album a raw sound that Prince himself has never matched. He effortlessly plays every instrument, drums, bass, keyboards vocals like a tight band. It's a no nonsense collection of fast, fun, and danceable music that presents Prince for the first time as most of us would always picture him. Many Prince fans await his return to this style of music 
Let's face it... Prince's albums up through Sign 'O the Times are brilliant. Dirty Mind in particular ranks as one of his very best (some would say his very best). Unlike many pop albums this is not merely a collection of songs, i.e. some radio hits and a bunch of filler. This album works organically as a whole, i.e. each track is integral to the album. Every track is excellent and the production and sound is very stripped back and "raw". This is pure pop/funk genius. Probably my favorite Prince album after Purple Rain and just above Controversy. Essential= Get it 
Dirty Mind from 1980 was Prince's third album in 3 years after "For You" and the second eponymous Prince album, they both had their moments but as a whole they hadn't been "complete" from beginning to end and Prince hadn't fully found his future sound nor had the big commercial success either. On this third album however, Prince goes from promising Soul-Funk artist to full grown pop star. He also goes fully out when it comes to sexual explicit material. Songs about Oral Sex, Incest and "just" normal sex on a few occasions made this album one of the most explicit albums of it's time, the one that parents would stop their children from listening to and the one that nowadays would get the "warning explicit lyrics" on it's cover. Simply put, Prince was a trendsetter that shaped the sound of the 80's and led the way to others. Apart from it's lyrics "Dirty Mind" is a perfectly well put album that mixes diffrent genre's without any rules. Pop, Funk, Rock, Psychedelia, you name it. On this album there's also considerably better melodies on the songs, all of them easily get into your head after a few listenings. Prince became a overnight celebrity and pop/rock star of class after "Dirty Mind", A real 80's classic. The album starts with the title track, that is one of the most catchiest Prince songs on the disc with it's funky melody and great hook. The song is all about sex, the lyrics speak for itself "I may not be your kind of man, I may not be your style, But honey all I wanna do,Is just love you for a little while". "When You Were Mine" follows the trend of good songs, it was later covered by Cyndi Lauper. Prince's version is better though. It's about unfaithfulness. "Do it All Night" is not hard to understand what's it all about. The song starts with some amazing synthesizer sounds that follows the whole song, It's indeed a funky song. "Gotta Broke Heart Again" is a classis breakup ballad. We had seen simular songs on previous albums. "Uptown", is about a man being accused of being gay by a girl he responds "No are you?", I suppose the songs meaning is about insecurity of being diffrent "Uptown" was also a suburb of Minneapolis where Prince grew up. Very catchy sound too. "Head" is what you think it's about "Sister" discusses incest. It's the rockiest songs here, with some good riffs. Only 1'30 minutes though. "Party Up" is the closer, it's a anti-war song, yeah Prince made a few of them too. It got a funky disco feeling all over it. Overall, The album that made Prince a star. Explicit, confessional and above all very complete, all of the 8 songs are catchy as hell and the lyrics will catchy you attention for sure. This was in 1980 so it defenitely was before it's time. Either way it remains a 80's classic and one of Prince's finest albums. Must have 
Man, what can I say about this album but CLASSIC!! Prince was 23 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as we had known it at that time was going in HIS direction! Never one to conform or confine himself to any one particular musical genre, he delves into new wave punk (Dirty Mind, When You Were Mine), then grooves us with the nasty but infectious "Do It All Night"... Then he goes into the album's only slow jam, the lamenting "Gotta Broken Heart Again", which is a classic to true Prince fans who go all the way back with him! Then Side 2 opens with the punk-funky "Uptown", which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids, experimental, ambisexual, free-lovin' late 70's / early 80's america!-- Which is the world that I came of age in! (I was 16 when this album came out and it seemed that Prince was reading my mind!) Then at the end of "Uptown" there's a cool synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into the classic gut-bucket synth funk of "Head", which is self- explanatory! Then, at the end of that, the same synth swoosh takes us into Prince's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid of 16 who lives (albeit antagonistically!) with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach him her warped view of the facts of life or else "Put him on the street again!"-- A punked-out, rockin', fast-moving piece that caused quite a stir back then! Then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my all-time fave Prince "Party Til' You Pass Out!" jams.... "Party Up"!! This song sends this classic album out with a bang! The "Dirty Mind Tour" of late '80 and early '81 was quite a spectacle to behold! Prince broke all the taboos of sexuality, fashion, staging and just brought a whole new energy to the game that just caught you on fire! He was the opening act (at that time!) for then "supposedly" notorious Rick James (RIP), whose "Fire It Up" tour was all the rage! But to those of us who were lucky enough to see it, it soon became apparent that Prince's flame made poor Rick's look like a bic lighter! After about 3 months of what was supposed to be a 6 month tour as Rick's opening act, tired of being upstaged, Rick James fired Prince from the tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004 when he had to finally acknowledge that Prince Rogers Nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature! If you don't have this album in your collection, you're short-changed 4-real! 
With his first two albums, Prince had yet to develop into a serious or lucrative artist. That all changed when he released his third album, 1980's Dirty Mind. The production was a landmark in new-wave pop, R, and urban funk. It also broke new ground in its explicit sexual and personal content. Nobody before the album's release has bared so much. Nearly every aspect of sexuality is discussed here: Homosexuality, excessive libido, threesomes, oral sex, incest, sexual freedom: everything Prince could think of. The album was recorded at his home studio with Prince playing nearly every instrument, with the exception of Dr Fink playing synthesizers on some of the tracks and Lisa Coleman doing some of the backup vocals. The album opens with the title track, a four minute robotic funk jam that sums up the whole album. When you here lyrics about laying down a woman in your daddy's car you know your entering some interesting subjects and lyrical themes. The most notorious subjects are explained in tracks six and seven. Track six titled,"Head", is the most explicit number about oral sex ever written. "Sister," is one and a half minutes of incest, lost of virginity, oral sex, nudity, and graphic language. Threesomes are discussed in track two and four while homosexuality and sexual freedom are discussed in tracks three and five. The closing track titled,"Partyup", is a relentless dance jam about dancing and partying as opossed to fighting in a war. To sum it up, 1999 and Purple Rain might not have come around if this album wasn't made. At only a half-hour long this album makes for a nice, short easy listen. Get this album and see what most pop and hip-hop has been built upon 
In the entire history of American cinema, Michael Moore's Bushwhacking expose FAHRENHEIT 9/11 has a special place--right up there with other ultra-controversial, politically-themed films like DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, JFK, THE CHINA SYNDROME, and MISSING. A lot of that has to do with the choices of music he made to accompany this crazy and highly charged creation of his. For instance, there are the original pieces of music supplied by composer Jeff Gibbs that make extensive use of keyboards and synthesizers: "The Un-President"; "Bush Waits...And Waits"; "Weapons Of Deceit"; "Deserter"; "Afghan Victory Dance"; and "All They Ask." These are brilliantly designed space-age pieces that make very clear the irony and the ire behind Moore's evidence, as well as allowing us to imagine an Orwellian world, Dubya style. Then there's his uses of once-forgotten 80s hits like the Go-Go's "Vacation" (heard during the segment showing Bush spending 42% of the first seven and a half months of his presidency vacationing in Crawford, Texas), and Joey Scarbury's "Theme From 'The Greatest American Hero'" (during that now-infamous "Mission Accomplished" photo-op on a navy ship off the California coast during the first months of the Iraq war). Jethro Tull's "Aqualung" is heard briefly in the film during an interview with a soldier in Iraq, but heard here in its entirety, while Neil Young's 1989 anti-George H.W. Bush missive "Rockin' In The Free World" blasts over the closing credits. But where Moore truly makes the most is in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with Estonian composer Arvo Part's 1976 composition "Cantus In Memory Of Benjamin Britten" for bell and full string orchestra. In the key of A Minor, it plays over the horrifying aftermath of the attacks in New York, with papers, ash, and smoke making a pall over the Big Apple. It is performed here by members of the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra, led by Paavo Jarvi. Rounded out by tracks from R.E.M., J.J. Cale, Bloodhound Gang, Eric Burdon, and Elmer Bernstein (a witty use of the composer's famous theme for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN), the FAHRENHEIT 9/11 soundtrack is a perfect companion to what is unquestionably one of the most incendiary and subversive movies, documentary or otherwise, ever unleashed into the world. It is a soundtrack full of irony, cynicism, anger, and remembrance, not only of 9/11, but of the Iraqi conflict, and the deceptions that led us to the place we are at now 
I have listened to this CD and find it a great collection of music, suiting the documentary perfectly. The most moving moment in the film is the recreation of the events on 9/11 in NY, together with 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten'. Mr Hamlow reports that this piece is by Paavo Jarvi, however it is actually written by the composer Arvo Prt. I just thought this should be pointed out... 
The bulk of the CD consists of instrumental music from Jeff Gibbs, which is mood-setting synth music. "The Un-President" was used in the opening of the movie, when Gore had justly won the 2000 election, only to have victory snatched from him. The stark grim piano track, "Bush Waits...and Waits" was used where the unpresident merely sat in his chair after getting news of the second plane hitting the WTC, and pondering who did this? There is some Philip Glass-style synth music in both "Weapons of Deceit" and "Deserter." Both have the same sound, except for the more techno electronica flavour of the latter. There are two other instrumentals aside from Gibbs'. One is Paarvo Jarvi's funereal and emotional rendition of Estonian composer Arvo Part's "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten" used during the 11 September segment, the sight of ash and debris floating down like gray snowflakes from the sky. The other is Elmer Bernstein's theme to the Magnificent Seven, used to depict Afghanistan as an example of U.S. cowboy diplomacy, starring Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, and Tony Blair. "All They Ask" is taken during the final segments of the movie, where Moore praises the young men serving in the military. "All they ask is that we don't put them in harm's way," he says in the voice-over. "Will they ever trust us again?" Now for the pop/rock songs. The Go-Go's' "Vacation," the title from their second album, was used to show what Dubya did after his poll numbers went down. Cue scenes at the ranch. Eric Burdon's "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place" from the 1960's was used in the scene describing how the Bin Laden family were the only ones allowed to leave by plane during 12-13 September 2001 while millions of Americans were stranded. The relationship between the Bushes and the rich Saudi oilmen shows them to be "Shiny Happy People," sung by R.E.M. and Katie Pierson of the B-52's. This was played where Poppie is shaking hands with the Saudis and saying how it's a happy reunion with good friends. The point being how the rich are shiny and happy, but what about the rest of us? I wonder how Jimmy Pop feels about young American soldiers using his group the Bloodhound Gang's song "Fire Water Burn" while they are destroying Baghdad. The part the young soldier quotes is "we don't need no water, let the MF burn. Burn MF Burn." Later in the movie, this song is used when the Iraqis take to the streets, dragging and later displaying the mutilated corpses of US soldiers. J.J. Cale's "Cocaine" only got used for a few seconds, but that was during the segment where Moore discusses Dubya's altered air force records. "If you wanna get down on the ground" can have connotations of how Bush was grounded along with James R. Bath for not reporting for their physicals while in the Texas Air National Guard. However, I cannot recall when Jethro Tull's "Aqualung" was used. Using Joey Scarbury's bubbly pop of "Believe It Or Not," during the scene of Bush proclaiming victory over Iraq aboard the aircraft carrier is clearly meant to evoke anger among those of us lefties. This is the theme song to the short-lived TV series The Greatest American Hero. The Greatest American Hero? Him? A joke surely, yes? I thought so. Played over the credits is Neil Young's jamming rocker "Rockin' In The Free World." A great song yes, but given the finale, using the Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again" would've been more appropriate, but Pete Townshend's refusal made that impossible. Not a complete soundtrack as the themes from Dragnet and Peter Gunn aren't included, but it's for a worthy cause and movie. This CD should have been reviewed before Election Day, for which I apologize, but maybe this will serve as a reminder of the importance of voter participation. 
Good, but not great soundtrack, but infinitely worth it for Joey Scarbury's immortal "Believe It Or Not" alone. You can't put a price tag on things like that.. 
It is so typical for soundtracks lately to leave out the best songs or scores of the film. This one is no exception! I very much wanted to hear the song that plays over the opening credits and the "Congressional Recruitment" scene. It is omitted from this otherwise great soundtrack. Studios need to start including all major works from films to make whole a "soundtrack. 
This soundtrack is the perfect compliment to Fahrenheit 9/11. It stands well on its own, meshing such pop-culture hits as the GoGo's "Vacation," and REM's "Shiny Happy People," as well as the numerous instrumental tracks that made this film so memorable. Highlights no doubt include "Weapons of Deceit," "All They Ask," and the timid (and telling) "Bush Waits... And Waits." Regardless of whether you agree with the film, this soundtrack gives the listener a veritable two-fer, mixing emotional and somber instrumentals with invigorating vocal pop tracks. "Rockin' in the Free World" indeed 
One of my morning jacket's most inconsistent and weird recordings to date, "Chocolate and Ice" runs as long as a strokes album. The unfortunate thing is Jim James' muse led him to record a 24 minute "Cobra" that could have been sliced up into at least three or four tracks by itself. But, that's the thing with this band. They are very creative. Therefore they will follow their many muses down long winding paths that can lead to weird places; some incredibly beautiful, others weird, but they always manage to make it interesting. That goes for track 5, "Holy" where James voice switches from reverb and non-reverb, I guess, just for the experimental fun of it all. If you're interested in that kind of weird experimental stuff then this album is for you. Because there is not only weird stuff but there's also some of the most beautiful tracks they have ever recorded (a major feat with this group). Two tracks that standout are "sooner" and "sweetheart." The former being a crowd favorite at concerts and for good reason. It's a slower song where James lyrical and prodigious singing ability are on fine showcase. It's not really a groundbreaking song musically with the same three chords played over again. But, the combination of a pretty spanish-sounding guitar riff, gorgeous pedal steel guitar, and James resonating high tenor laced with reverb that make the song unforgettable. When you think that a pretty slow song couldn't be topped on one short ep, James offers "Sweetheart" as the closer and what a closer it is. A singer such as James who has been in this game for so long knows his own talents and he knows how to use them to create chills down your spine. That's what he does on "Sweetheart." It combines a pretty little piano riff, bongos for percussion, a nice little guitar solo in the middle that builds the drama, and the best harmonizing since the beach boys. As to why this song isn't played in concert more often, I've know idea. One of my favorite and one of the most romantic songs the Jacket has done. The line "sweetheart, lover, I wanted you before, but when the heart beats next to me I want it even more" is unexpectedly disarming. Did I mention James manages to somehow sound like Alice in Chains with his harmonizing on this one? I would say that the "good songs" on this one are tracks 1,2, the first song in track 3, and track 6. Buy this if you're interested in the Jacket's experimental stuff. But, a better bet would be the "Sweetbees" import from Australia. It has the two best tracks I mentioned above, and a slew of other brilliant tracks from other albums. 
If you are trying to decide between the two studio recordings of Norma with Callas, I offer some advice. Get them both. The later recording is quite beautiful and better recorded. The earlier has a fresher sounding Callas but she does have more dramatic insight in that later recording. Ludwig is a nice treat in a bel-canto role. Overall, I highly recommend 
This is a strange recording for me. It features three all time favorite singers of mine, Callas, Ludwig and Corelli, and yet I had very mixed feelings about it. Some have called Callas's performance here more refined than the earlier recording and the famous live performances. I would characterize her performance as slightly cautious. Her Norma is older, wiser and a bit on the weathered side. I wonder how much of the refinement was her own sense of having to compensate for her voice which was in the final stages of decline. I expected a certain degree of the recklessness that she displayed in her second Tosca recording that was made a few years later. Here she seems to be carefully phrasing at times as to not hurt something. But, despite the vocal decline, not just the high notes but the tone, her mastery of the style and ease with which she handles the coloratura passages, is still a miraculous listening experience. I'm glad I have the recording and the current edition is warmer than the original CD release. This was the only opportunity for Callas, Corelli and Ludwig to make a commercial recording together, and Corelli and Ludwig are wonderful, although too bad EMI was unable to get Simionatto. But if you're familiar with the earlier recording (which by the way is only available at the moment in an awful GROTC edition) and the live performances, you might miss the broad strokes, I do, but it is still a worthy listening experience. When is Callas not? Never as far as I'm concerned. I would have loved to have rated this 5 stars, but 4 seems more appropriate. It's a fine but not a great recording. 
Well, I think there are two roles in the history of opera that after the interpretation of Maria Callas it would not be unwise to claim that they should not be performed again: Norma by Bellini (all recordings she ever made) and la Traviata by Verdi (the definition of the role lies in the London 1958 Traviata- unfortunately, her 1953 studio recording with Cetra is almost unacceptable considering how she developed the role of Violetta after 1955). Although I very rarely sit down to write a review at Amazon, after having read so much on Mme Callas, I feel it is my responsibility as a fan of this great art named opera to make the following points: a)Maria Callas was not an interpreter. She was a creator herself to be placed at the same rank as Donizzeti, Bellini and Verdi. Had it not been for her I doubt that opera would exist today and if it did it would be a sad, boring musuem exhibit. She recreated the whole of Italian Opera -not just bel canto- and modernised it in a way that will make it last for another 100 years aftet her death. I remind you that opera in the 50's meant German Opera. Italian opera before Mme Callas was something of a joke. Terribly abused by singers and a bad tradition of horrendus vocalising, the music of Italian composers had lost its drama, its sense, its meaning. b)why do people spend so much time judging the voice of this great artist? Why can they not just relax and enjoy this great artistry? No-one says that there no other great singers! But no matter how great, they are unfortunately just that:"singers". Caballe, Sutherland, Sills, Price, Fleming, Dessay all have amazing voices and great carreers. But, comparing them with a phenomenon that was for the opera what Mozart was for classical music simply does not do them justice. c)Whether we like it or not Norma is a dramatic soprano role! A very difficult one as well and it should be treated with some respect. Caballe and Sutherland, because they had these amazing voices, did manage to sing it and they sang it well. But, as they were not dramatic sopranos they conveyed a lyricism in their interpretation that simply does not suit the role and Bellini's intentions. Other attempts however (Sills and -alas- Gruberova recently)should really remain as textbook examples of how inflated egos can ridicule both theselves and a work of art. I repeat that Norma is a dramatic soprano role. In this sense the only singers that approached the Callas perfection are Elena Suliotis (Decca for reason of expediency or stupidity is not reissuing her marvellous 1968 recording with Del Monaco) and Jane Eaglen in the Sony Muti recording. The only singer that seems to have been taught by the Callas Legacy in Bel Canto is Mme Renata Scotto but she was as well inadequate as Norma and wasted much of her talent singing (for commercial reasons, I suppose) Puccini. d)Callas has been very unlucky as far as supporting cast is concerned. The 1960 Norma recording is the only exception. It features the amazing Franco Corelli. What a voice this man had! Pefect voice, perfect dramatic conviction, beautiful and clear italian diction. Can we imagine a Callas -Corelli partnership in Aida, Pirata, Manon Lescaut? e)Callas did not lose her voice even though she overworked it in the 50s. The 1964 Tosca recording is the best proof of that. But she did lose her confidence and emotional stability. This fact led her quit her carreer in 1965 and that is the real tragedy of opera. Had she managed to work as hard in the 60-68 period when all her worry was Ar. Onassis we would have been left with at least 10 amazing stereo recordings. And I say 68 because someone like Callas simply would refuse to play young soprano roles after the age of 45. She believed that opera singers are like ballet dansers or athletes (and they are!), they should retire early. Mme Sutherland had a voice till the age of 60. And so? Is it not ridiculous singing La Sonnambula at the age of 59? If Callas did that she would not be the legend she is! This is all I wanted to note on a woman that achieved a fame in the world of opera (and beyond!!!) in a way that noone else had before and I am afraid no one else will do so in the future. People had to sleep on pavements for three days and three nights to get a ticket for this lady! 
Reading through the online reviews, it is obvious that Maria created great controversy because her approach to classical singing and acting was so very different. She was everything, extraordinary singer with a rare vocal technique of endless colors and shades, from the video footage we have now we can see that she was truly the charismatic actress described in previous years, and above all . . . she was one of the great musicians of the last century. No singer classical or popular has been without vocal problems, and it is important to remember that Maria began her stage career at the age of 17 with the Athens Opera as a professional opera singer. Her last stage performances were in 1965 in Tosca and Norma . . . a stage and recording career of almost 25 years! No small achievement, and she performed her great roles, Violetta, Lucia, Medea, and of course Norma . . . all over the world "live" for over a decade, Norma for almost 15 years. It would be difficult to say of such an artist that "one" role was her best, since her vast repertory ranged from Wagner and Beethoven to Bellini, Puccini, Bizet and so many other composers. She single handedly with the help of her great vocal and musical mentor Tullio Serafin, resurrected the great belcanto works of Donizetti and Bellini and transformed them in integrated vocal and dramatic experiences . . . fortunately for us, there are quite a few studio and live recordings available of this repertoire which she loved so much. Personally, I never found Bellini's Norma to be a very interesting opera until I heard the 1960 recording with Maria. All previous recordings were lovely, with various singers singing 'Casta Diva' beautifully, but disengaged from the dramatic impact of the words and this complex woman, this figure out of a Greek tragedy! Maria's 1960 performance I feel remains a rare experience, in which all the artists seem riveted by the dramatic power of her by then mesmerizing interpretation of Norma. Every subtlety of this conflicted woman's story is expresssed, even down to just single words. Like many of her recordings and her career in general, I feel this recording is for the ages . . . unforgettable and deeply, deeply moving. 
A wonderful recording with a stellar cast and magnificient sound quality. Callas's voice does show signs of decline-some uneven coloratura, some long melodic lines that have to be split because she can't fit everything in one breath, some high notes that sound shrill; but the portrayal of the character has never been more convincing: pure and noble in the 1st act, full of remorse at the beginning of the 2nd, full of compassion and very human at the beginning of the scene with Adalgisa, turning into fury and indignance at the sight of Pollione. Norma's aria as she readies to kill her children is a wonderful performance from Callas, every single word being so vividly colored to convey the torture and struggle within Norma. By the end of the opera, with the final duet with Pollione, one believes that Callas has become Norma herself-ardent, loving and very noble. Ludwig's Adalgisa is a young but also very passionate one. Corelli's awesome, his 2 arias in the 1st act are handled just perfectly. Serafin's conducting is outstanding, bringing the endless melodic inspirations of Bellini's opera to life. 
With so many of Maria Callas's performances, I find myself saying, "Callas IS Tosca", "Callas IS Armida", "Callas IS Elvira", "Callas IS Amina" - and it's not because I lack the ability to turn a phrase (at least, so I think). It's simply and solely because there has not been another singer who has Callas's ability to become the character she is singing. Yes, there are wonderful opera singers who are very good actresses/actors, but there is an endless and uncrossable desert between "very good actress" and what Callas achieved. It was remarkable - one sees it very vividly in her concert performances captured now on DVD. At one instant she is busy being Maria Callas the gracious (not a performance I admire), and the next instant, as the music starts, mon Dieu, she has become the character of the aria. BECOME it. She is as far beyond good acting as pink is beyond red. The difference is not just in quantity, but in quality. That this is at least in part due to her voice is undeniable. Callas sang as though her voice were a servant to each persona she sang, and each time it must have been an incredible feat of wrestling to achieve what she did. Blessed by very high intelligence and a remarkable standard of musicianship, she had no problems with the demands of the music - and for such a dark and powerful voice, what a superb coloratura technique she had! But over and above the technical abilities she possessed, and the voice of unique and spellbinding quality that she had, was her ability to pour all the emotions she experienced right into that voice. It never became ham; it was never over the top; it was never over-subtle; it was never anything but exactly there, right there - the character as perfectly conceived and perfectly conveyed as anything in the world. Norma is a fiendish role to sing. One admires those proponents who have brought something special to the role - Sutherland for that majestic coolness and absolute ease of coloratura, Caballe for a quite amazing affinity (and that exquisite voice before it escaped her control), and Callas - well, I am sorry. What can I say? I am driven again to saying... Callas WAS Norma. If one expects to hear flawless singing, one can hear singers whose recorded voices have been tweaked by sound engineers. Or one can hear a pretty voice never extending itself and finding less meaning within Norma than one would find within a sock. But what has an unflawed performance to do with a superb performance? The greatest singers of all are those who make their flaws work for them rather than hide them at all costs at the expense of meaning and the love of art itself. There was no Norma like Callas... and in this live performance, she gives unstintingly. As though this were not enough, we have an absolutely SPLENDID Pollione in Franco Correlli, and the best Adalgisa I've ever heard in Christa Ludwig's delicious performance. One is often let down by these two key roles - but not here. The duet work between Callas and Ludwig is sublime. In fact, this entire opera recording is so exciting that I feel galvanised just remembering it. Whenever I wish to hear "Norma" again, it is to this recording that I most often turn. (I possess five recordings of this beautiful opera, plus the magnificent DVD of Caballe's live performance.) Utterly, utterly superb 
When I first heard this recording I was spellbounded. It was my second time that I heard Callas, the first being "La Gioconda". What a difference in her two portrayals! Here, Norma is presented as being a woman of a noble nature, presented first in the aria "Casta Diva". The voice here is more eloquent and more subtle, if one can use such a term, than in the "Norma" recording of 1953. There the Callas' voice was purerer, but it lacked the subltelty of the voice in this recording. Also, by this time Callas had grasped the dramatic nuances of the role. In my judgement, Callas sounds better here than in her earlier recording 
Yes, her voice may be experiencing more of those undesirable qualities now, and yes it was probably not at its freshest at this point of her career, but nevertheless her Norma is still unmatched in terms of vocal beauty and moreover, dramatic beauty. Never in the history of opera has there been a Norma more human, more honest, more down-to-earth, and more of a woman than the Norma in this studio recording. One cannot say that she will ignore the wincing high notes for the sake of fanhood, but if one were to look more deeply into is beauties, while accepting those faults as well, he can acknowledge the magnificent tonal qualities juxtaposed upon this ever so complex role. You have to admit that in her 1954 recording, her voice was found in a much more stable form than it is in this one, but with the powers of a super cast, plus the creative forces of Tullio Serafin and the great tenor Franco Corelli, how can someone ignore this Norma for the mere fact that Callas' voice was not what it used to be? Her middle and low registers are more refined here, and if you listen to her duet with Adalgisa, you will hear the voice of a mentor, a mother, and a friend. I love this Norma, and I truly respect Maria Callas for this. Thank you Madame Callas for making such a great impact on opera. 
During my fifty years of enjoying opera, I never "got" Callas---or Bellini, for that matter---until now. (I found his music too pretty and her voice too unpretty for my taste.) This evening I turned on my local NPR station and heard this NORMA in progress. It stopped me in my tracks. Here is "opera as drama" in spades! Serafin's taut conducting perfectly sets off Callas's intense, riveting vocal performance. Corelli and Ludwig are in splendid form as well. As soon as I heard the credits at the opera's end, I came online to buy it. If you want "pretty," there are other recordings. If you want "breathtaking," try this one 
What a compilation. White-boy boogie blues with a funky swagger. For those of you being introduced to the Feat, this is the place to start. From here you will want to go through their entire catalogue with Lowell George singing (Rock/blues lost a treasure when he passed on...)Don't bother with the stuff put out after his departure. This compilation has a few live songs, outtake versions of original album songs, and other odds and sods. Rock in Roll Doctor,Skin it Back,Easy to Slip,Red Steamliner,Lonesome Whistle,Gringo,Over the Edge,Two Trains are essential Feat. Best of...compilation...whatever you call it, 'Hoy Hoy' is great music 
This is one great collection. Almost a story or scrapbook of sorts of that wild 70s outfit, Little Feat. Hear two versions of "Teenage Nervous Breakdown" side by side! Hear unreleased gems ("Framed" and "Gringo")! Hear a New Orleansified "Rock And Roll Doctor!" Hear a touching tribute to Lowell George by Linda Rondstadt! Marvel at the chilling "China White!" And Roll on Through the Night while it ends... A must have 
A grab bag of tasty goodies for all Feat fans. Several live tracks which never made it onto Waiting for Columbus and a deep well of out-takes, alternate versions and curios. Plus a hilarious explanation of Lowell's slide of choice (because you can go just about anywhere and find one). If you love the Feat, you'll love this collection

This is a nice collection of old Feat standards in different settings. The Live Versions of Teenage Nervous Breakdown and Skin It Back just rock and groove. Also there is an interesting mix of Two Trains with some mesmerizing percussion/drum beats. China White is the show stopper with Lowell wailing the blues like the pro he was. Anyway, this is a super compilation that should not be ignored by any means

I'll keep it short, but I grew up with the Feats. Riding across the HHH bridge in Duluth, MN in 1976. Lowell was the man. I cried when I read the Rolling Stones article. Feats, Keep it rollin, and don't fail me now. I love YO 
Awesome CD and its a great start. To me not his strongest but hey, its his first CD. The CD progresses perfectly and shows him to be strong lyrically and bringing the heat and also the ho's. Ludacris is big into the ho's. Over time he has let the whole Ho thing slowly fade away. I think thats a plus because it shows him to be a respectable artists instead of putting down women. Especially with his new cd where he brings props to women and his Mom. If you wanna grab this I suggest it because you can see where Ludacris came from. He has gotten more creative beats and gotten better at being...well just Luda 
After bursting out in the scene with his debut single, "What's Your Fantasy", Ludacris brings new hope to the south. With his sinister voice along with his catchy punchlines and lyrics, he is out to prove why he was the first rapper signed to Def Jam South. 1. U Got a Problem? - 4/5 2.

there are some great songs and some terrible songs from Ludacris but overall it is pretty good. there are some songs like "Whats your fantasy" and "Southern Hospitality". It has great production from Chaka Zulu. Ludacris isn't a great lyricist but knows some good comedy 
Being one of my favorite artists in the game today, i have to say that Luda is at his best with his debut album. Full of amusing lyrics and his unique rhyme style, he puts together an album with outstanding songs. Listen to hsi freestyle 'mouthing off'. He is one of the best freestylers out there. Basically if your a fan of Ludacris or southern rap then this is a must have album. 4.5/5 Top 5: Stick 'Em Up Phat Rabbit Southern Hospitality Ho U Got A Proble 
I bought this cd in Febuary of this year because I wanted a good cd to listen to on a long car trip that I was going on. I purchased this and Word of Mouf. This cd is amazing. The beats are awesome, but that is not even the best part. In every song, Luda is off the freaking chain. He flows so well throughout the whole album that it is almost unbelievable. He also has an instantly recognizable voice and he has tons of punchlines in every song. Each song has a great hook (something that Luda has become known for) and has funny lyrics. My favorite song would have to be Game Got Switched, Phat Rabbit, or Southern Hospitality. I highly recommend this cd to everyone because it is a dirty south classic 
this album wuz really hot when it first came out n his first single Whats Ur Fantasy is still hot I love it Top 5: U Got a Problem? Game Got Switched Whats Your Fantasy Whats Your Fantasy (Remix) Southern Hospitalit 
What an amazing CD. An awesome combination of instrumentals and vocals. The title track is my absolute favorite !! 
There are a lot more vocals on this disc than his previous works. Some of the songs work well without the voices, though. Brickman has a gift for transforming musical notes into beautiful arrangements. However, the voices detract from teh talent 
As a long-time lover of piano music, maybe it was destiny that my introduction to Jim Brickman should be his "Destiny" album. From the first song, "Part Of My Heart" I was hooked. The album gently builds with "Bittersweet" (a personal favorite) and "Meant To Be", followed by the delightful and lively collaboration with Herb Alpert on "Rendevous". Unfortunately the mood is broken by the jarring introduction of "Hush Li'L Baby" (a collaboration with Carly Simon). I skip this track automatically. "Crooked River" follows. The soft meandering notes of this song effectively restore the album's equilibrium. "Crossroads" livens the pace a tad, its smooth cresendo the perfect prelude to the rich vocals sung by Michael W. Smith on "Love Of My Life". With "Freedom", "By Chance" (another personal favorite) and "Rememberance" Jim so eloquently draws the listener into a symbiotic-like state with himself by simply playing solo. He follows this with a seamless return to vocal accompaniment with "Your Love" sung by Michelle Wright and the album's title cut "Destiny", a duet featuring Jordan Hill and Billy Porter. The final track of the album depends on which version you purchased--there are two. One features "What We Believe In" sung by Pam Tillis. The other (and the album I purchased) ends with the song "A Rainbow Connection" sung by Jim after a short personal introduction. If you don't have this version--get it! You will treasure it for life 
This was my first taste of Jim Brickman and I can't get enough. Treat yourself! 
This was a fabulous CD. I loved every song on the album 
Sometimes you just want to get away from the World.You don't want to hear Rock and Roll,you just want to take it easy after a Hard Day at work.I bought this tape because I knew Carly Simon was featured on one of the cuts,"Hush Li'l Baby." Carly's vocals are fantastic,along with her Children,Sally and Ben.The hit single's,"Love of my Life," with Michael W.Smith,and "Destiny,"with Jordan Hill and Billy Porter, are wonderfull,but my favorite vocal is "Your Love," featuring Michelle Wright.The greatest Instumental is the Herb Alpert duet,"Rendezvous." The production on this cut is very different from Jim's other recordings.Its has a latin fill. Jim even sings one song ,"The Rainbow Connection." Brickman has a honest,nice singing voice that makes you fill good inside.If you are a Jim Brickman fan,you will enjoy"Destiny. 
I love listening to this album. Every track with the exception of "Hush little baby" (sorry.. I just don't like it)is worth the price of the CD alone!! I originally bought this album for the song "Love of my Life" with Michael W. Smith. I discovered two more 'favorites' in "Destiny" and "Your Love". I'm hoping to use some of the instrumental music as part of a wedding ceremony in the future! 
This is a great soundtrack that weaves the story of Tristan and Isolde perfectly with the various scores 
I went to see this movie b/c I love historic drama's. I loved the movie and thought the music was pretty interesting. Before reading other reviews I honestly never heard of Wagner nor had I seen the opera. I just love good soundtracks and I bought this cd b/c I thought it would be one of them.....so I obviously can't compare the music from the opera to this soundtrack. Although I found the soundtrack a little slow I think the music fits the movie very well. My only dislike is I thought the music for the big actions scenes could have been approached differently (#8 was a bit like fingernails on a chalkboard...but to each their own). All in all a very good soundtrack and I would definitely recommend. 
Most motion picture musical score composers would find the task of writing music for the current TRISTAN ISOLDE a daunting assignment. Who in their right mind would want to be set up as a comparison to the time-honored, exquisitely beautiful music from Wagner's opera of the same name? Well, Anne Dudley steps fully into the spotlight as a fine composer with this score for an altogether different version of the ancient tale of thwarted lovers. She has no reason to bow her head. Dudley stirs the background of the scenic settings with subtle music than tastefully blends Celtic instruments and sounds with the regular orchestral instrumentation. She is able to cross back and forth across the water that divides Britain and Ireland, no mean feat but one of paramount importance in underlining the disparity of the two kingdoms that separate the love of Isolde and Tristan. The music is always supportive of the film's mood and storyline (it takes listening to this CD to actually hear some of the very fine episodes that rightly provided matrix to the action without calling attention to the tunes). For this different version of a multifaceted and varying forms of an old Celtic legend, Dudley has provided music more redolent of the Dark Ages than of the soul-shattering eroticism of Wagner's version of the tale. For this listener her choices are exactly appropriate. Grady Harp, May 0 
Once again we have a bunch of music snobs attacking the music from this film not because it is not good but because it doesn't pay homage to Wagner. There are upwards of 100 folk variations of this tale and most of those did not even incorporate a musical score....but we owe Wagner a walk on because of his opera? Please..... The music in this movie is breathtaking and poignant. It mirrors the tale wonderfully, which if it were Wagner the other music Snobs would be saying "germanic music for a celtic storry???????" This score is not good to fall asleep by. The arguments of music snobs will perform that task just fine grimm_celt@yahoo.co 
I saw the movie twice and knew right away that I would have to have the soundtrack. I'm glad that I invested the money and bought it! The score is absolutely gorgeous, despite some comparisons to "elevator music" by other reviewers. Don't let the naysayers fool you. "Tristan Isolde" is fantastic, a great CD to put on while you're having dinner with a sweetheart or just relaxing - it will both calm your jangled nerves after a long day and inspire you. It is very well composed. As to the mutterings that a nod to Wagner should have been included, this is the soundtrack to the movie, not the opera. It does a fine job of standing on its own. Don't miss out on this one 
This soundtrack is so awesome. It's great music to drive to or just hang out and listen. The music fits the movie so well 
On one of the trailors to the movie there is a song sung by a woman. I have heard rumors that the song is by Amy Lee. If anyone knows the song or the artist who sings it please email me at sweetchik8806@aol.co 
Yes, Tristan and Isolde the Opera is much different than Tristan and Isolde the movie. However the differences are paralleled in music also. While both are epic, sweeping, and deeply emotional, one appeals to a more conscious experience, the other satiates a more escapist notion - the notion that appeals to most movie-goers. I enjoy celtic music intertwined with new age and a smattering of emotion. If you find yourself drawn to similar genres, then you will find yourself enjoying the Soundtrack of Tristan Isolde. Although if you are looking for a truly engaging emotional experience whereby you have allowed yourself little distraction, the Operatic version will offer more of a wholistic experience. Thus the two are two very different interpretations of one quite beautiful love story 
*Newsflash* This is not a Wagner opera CD, I don't know why people would expect it to be either, Wagner didn't invent the story- and of course it would be totally out of place in this film.... So, as a soundtrack it is lovely music with a celtic influence .(which is more true to the story than a German composer's music 
I can respect that the composer for the motion picture wanted to create her own musical adaptation for the epic, but it's almost ignorant to not even acknowledge Wagner in a simple thematic context. It's not to say works shouldn't be reinvented, but it's also hard to say anyone stands up in comparison to Wagner when it comes to opera. I believe it was Ad Girl that didn't know what she was talking about, considering the reviewer below her was simply making some observations for people who listen to actual music. Not people who assume all instrumentals are great works of art 
Standout tracks: GOING HARD, BACK UP OFFA ME, BROKEN GLASS, WE KNOW, I TRY, AROUND MY WAY, WE GOT THE BEAT,GHETTO SHOW and THE BEAUTIFUL STRUGGLE. Filler: A Game(what this son sounds like),Work it out(Talib rappin offbeat big nono!), Black girl pain(why didnt this collabo work?), Never been in love(too R for a Talib song). This album might not be better than QUALITY but it is not a bad follow up. As for you reviewers that nominated this album as the worst album in 2003 I hope your opinions arent heavily influenced by cheap ragazines like The Sauce, XXLAME, Jive and GQ(gayqueer). Because as far as they are concerned anything that comes out of slavery records/aftermath is hip hop in its truest form. 
Kweli is hot he raps about life with amazing flows and lyrics he speaks the truth unlike the mainly overated rappers in the game top albu 
This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I loved all the songs on this CD except one. My favorite is "Black Girl Pain" and it should be an anthem and inspriration for Black women all over the globe. I had the pleasure of seeing Talib in concert a few months ago in Atlanta and his live show was even better than his CD. True Hip-hop lives 
I first heard Talib on the track Get Em High off of the College Dropout, and then again on Wack N*ggas off of the Take Em To The Cleaner's Mixtape by Consequence. He was hott on both of those tracks and then I saw this cd on sale at a store recently. The first thing to say is that this cd is absolutely amazing when it comes to lyrics. In my opinion, Kweli is one of the best lyricists out there, and there have been a lot of good ones. Every song is good lyrically, but the beats could've been better. I like some of the beats, but a few more Hi-Tek beats would have been nice and so would the appearence of Mos Def on a couple of songs. My favorite song is I Try, just because I like the lyrics and I like Kanye's beat. I know it sounds like Get By, but I still love it. I highly recommend this cd because there are not many people that can match Talib Kweli lyrically and he is just very impressive 
Having Quality and Right About Now, this is his weakest overall album but it is still great. The production lags a little on the weak cuts but the good cuts are superb. If your looking for something that you don't listen to everyday on the radio and a breathe of fresh air in this rap mess I would advice you to pick up all of Talib's cd because he is the BK MC. TOP 3 Going Hard I Try Black Girl Pai 
if you want some polite, well behaved, entirely house-brocken hiphop cop this. the album, much like Quality, is a polished, groomed, made up and dressed up corpse: lifeless and soul-less. loved Blackstar, but this is a waste of time. 
I honestly can't review the whole CD because I have only heard Step Up. It was on the The Late Show with Jay Leno.... I whole song was terrible. The dancing was awful. I am not a pop fan by anymeans but this was a joke. In fact I thought this was a joke - a play off of The Pussy Cat Dolls - until I realized that this is a "real legitement" band.... This does nothing but deteriorate the music scene as a whole. It floods the market with crap. yuck - no thank you, even the teenie boppers could find something better to listen to 
I highly recommend this cd - whether your 6 or 60, it will have your toes tapping! My daughter and I BOTH love this cd, and jam to it almost daily. You won't go wrong with this cd 
Anyone who's a fan of The Cheetah Girls will love this CD. Filled with the tunes from the recent Cheetah Girls 2 movie on The Disney Channel, this CD had my 11-year-old daughter and her friends rockin'. It's a must have for the 8-12-years set 
After listening to the first Cheetah Girls soundtrack, I couldn't wait to purchase this one for my 9 year old daughter. The Cheetah Girl's songs have such a positive message for girls of all ages. The only thing better is hearing them in concert. All I have to say is WOW! These girls (minus Raven since she doesn't perform with them on stage) can really sing. They sound great live, so you know their voices aren't played with on their cds. My daughter and I listen to both Cheetah girls cd's in our van and it takes us right back to the concert. 
In only 6 weeks, this CD has been certified Gold by RIAA!!!!! I really love this CD, my favorite songs are: Step Up The Party's Just Begun Strut Cherish The Moment Amigas Cheetahs and the others are cool, too 
If you enjoyed Disneys "High School Musical" and/or "The Cheetah Girls" movies you just might want to check out The Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack. It has fast, upbeat songs, that just make you want to get up and dance. The songs also include a message hidden within them. For example "Do Your Own Thing" which could be viewed as it's okay to be different from others, and individuality is a good thing. Music like this is a lot better than some songs that are released these days. And it's not just set for a certain age group. Don't feel guilty if your older than 14 or so and enjoy this music. Do Your Own Thing 
A brilliant CD for children, and adults alike. I got this CD, because one of the kids I babysit LOVES singing along with the sesame street videos, so I figured he would enjjoy dancing and singing along to the CD aswell. I was right! He loves singing along to all the classic sesame songs, and I love singing along too! Makes me remember my days as a little girl when I sang the same songs! Very cute. Kids of all ages will get a kick out of this CD. = 
I nearly cried as I listened to some of the samples of this great cd. I had forgotten some of the beautiful sesame street classic tunes like "Me" sung by Grover and "Imagination" sung by Kermit. This is a great album to give to your kids if you want them to develop a healthy self image and a good imagination. I think preschool and kindergarten teachers would do their students a favor by purchasing and playing any classic Sesame St. music. I am so grateful my parents let my siblings and I watch only positive tv shows and listen to positive music 
Where would Platinum be without Platinum Too? This cd is great fun for the whole family. It is so easy to be silly when one of the Sesame Street cds is on. It is great at home, but really great in the car on long road trips. A great buy, [for any age :)] Highly recommended by "torri'smom" who once was a Sesame Street kid herself. 
As part of the first generation of Sesame Street kids (and I'm almost 40), this CD is for all of us who know deep in our hearts that C IS for Cookie and that Mr Whipple's store is right around the corner. I grew up with this music and had the privilege of growing up all over agin with my kids, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and my personal favorite, Grover. If you were ever a kid that sat in front of the TV after school and laughed at Bert and Ernie, then this CD is for you. We are never to old to find our way back to Sesame Street. We love you, Jim Henson, wherever you are 
Me and my Peanut both enjoyed "Mah Na Mah Na". It is good for the entire family. Well done, Bert. This is our very first review 
This is a no-brainer... it's Sesame Street songs... every kid loves 'em. Nothing bad to say at all... your kids like Big Bird? Get 'em this CD 
Ohhh c'mon, admit it--sometimes you've got a sweet tooth for cute boys singing cute songs about girls. If that describes you, The Lashes' "Get It" should feed your addiction nicely! Granted, The Lashes' main appeal is to the young, estrogen-fuelled crowd. But as an "adult", I can say that they've even found a spot in MY heart. I saw them open for The Living End and they really do put on a great live show. Tons of energy, very tightly organized--which is impressive for a band that has so many members! Ben is a very engaging frontman; totally works the crowd and clearly has fun doing it. The occasional banter between Ben and keyboard/vox Jacob demonstrates further that these guys have fun, don't take s#% too seriously, and love what they're doing. Sure, they're poppy, but these guys are talented! The album has great melodies, fun call-and-response hooks, heartfelt vocals, and "Pretty Girl..." has been stuck in my head for a week (which is kinda ironic--did they mean do to that? I wouldn't doubt it!). I guarantee that you'll be singing along in no time. Bottom line: if you take yourself too seriously, you may not like these guys. If you want an album that you can put on and dance around in your room while singing into a hairbrush? Get "Get It" and have fun. "Cause a pretty girl is like a melody It hits you when you're awake gets you when you're asleep And I can't get this song out of my head..." timelybrussels[at]hotmai 
Do Ben Clark's teenage fans realize that he's pushing thirty? The dude is OLD. He's not a young jackass, he's an OLD jackass. And isn't it a bit creepy that an OLD dude like Ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds? Check out the Lashes MySpace profile. Creeeeepy! 
so i have heard this being described as new wave-powerpop. new wave i hear, but i dont like the word pop cause that makes me think boy band... which its not.. but it is rockin i know that much. I cannot stop listening to this cd. this is my new favorite band. i have been in a music slump because i am so picky about what im listening to and everything that heard sounded the same but this band actually excites me... if that makes sense. 
I first heard The Lashes on the internet, and I've loved them ever since. Their songs are catchy and fun, and the band's energy is contagious. This is one of the few cd's that I listen to all the way through, and I can't help but dance and sing along. A few of the highlights on the cd are "New Best Friend", "Sometimes The Sun", "Yesterday Feels Like A Year", and "Nate's Song", although in my opinion, every song is great in it's own way. The Lashes aren't trying to be the next great songwriters, they're just trying to have fun, and I for one am happy to go along for the ride. By the way, if you've never read an interview with the lead singer, Ben Clark, aka Ben Lashes, you should look him up right away. There's a reason he's know as the BEST INTERVIEW EVER 
this review is pretty funny you have to admit..... "This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - "Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Huh?? Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!! The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons. "I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Which one? Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two. Whatever. Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair. Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat. How lame is that? And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes? They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro. I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer "pep-talking" his band. So embarassing. "Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural. You never know who might be in the audience. And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later." Cool guys." 
With so many excellent unsigned bands in the world, you really have to wonder when you stumble across a major label debut from a band as terminally boring as The Lashes. Get It provides around 40 minutes of straight-ahead rock that is far too by the numbers. Straight-ahead rock can be fun when played with blistering emotion; however, The Lashes are going through the motions. Bringing absolutely nothing fresh to the table musically, the compact songs seem to drone on well past three minutes. Occasionally slipping into a faux-European accent, lead singer Ben Clark sounds about as pretentious as a rock star can get without actually being a member of Spinal Tap. The album features mind-blowing elementary lyrics such as: "Sometimes the sun goes down/Sometimes it comes back up/I'm wondering which one you're watching now" on "Sometimes The Sun". In an attempt to wake up the band on "Safe To Say", the Seattle sextet ends up making more noise than music. The Lashes' laughable hook on the song consists of repeating: "I guess it's safe to say it's over" about 10 times. Unfortunately for the listener, it isn't over at that point - the album still has another seven attempts to bore you into submission. Rock music should be dangerous and fresh. Listening to it should give the image of a runaway freight train that might fly off the tracks at any moment. You know exactly where all 11 of these songs are going, and don't care. There is nothing fresh, new, exciting, or emotional on this album. Do not follow the album title's advice. 
If you heard The Lashes' single "Sometimes the Sun" on the radio and dismissed them as another indie-pop band, you were wrong. This is pure powerpop bliss, catchy enough to keep your attention without being a ripoff of Weezer, and consistent enough to sound like the same band but not the same song, a feat which most artists either can't or don't want to achieve. When people blast bands like this for sounding like a bad version of Weezer, they usually forget that Weezer, the best band to ever walk the face of they earth, owes as much to Nirvana as they do Big Star. The Lashes, however, are much more pop than grunge. In conclusion, buy the album, put it on, and rock out 
I'd only heard a few songs from online, but as soon as I downloaded and heard the first 10 seconds of "Dear Hollywood" there was no question that I needed to go out and "Get It" (ooh, bad pun) immediately. If you don't like this cd, you probably just don't have good taste in music, and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you that. Every song on this album is good. These guys have great harmonies and hooks and everything that makes a fun rock and roll pop song. I only wish regular radio stations would wake up and stop playing crap and start playing bands like this. Seriously, "Dear Hollywood" is one of the best songs I've heard in a great while, and everyone I've played it for agrees with me. ALL the other tracks are catchy and fun to dance to and /or sing along with. I guarantee if you listen to the album twice you will have at least one of the songs playing on repeat in your head, whether you want it there or not. 
Get It was long awaited by many patient...and in my case, impatient...fans. Now that its finally out, we can all party. This album is worth its weight in powerpop gold. Each song has something unique about it - for example, Nate's solo in Daddy's Little Girl. All of the twelve songs transition perfectly into one another; New Best Friend is an energetic opening to the album, and Wanna Girl is a satisfying finish. To clarify: there will be a lot of people who wont like this album. You can't take it too seriously, its just a slew of super fun, dancable pop songs 
I have good news for the guys in Rooney and Hot Hot Heat: you'll have plenty of free time on your hands these next few months, as Seattle's the Lashes have taken the liberty of recording your new albums for you. Be sure to send them a thank-you card from the beach. I'm only half-joking. Get It, the Lashes' full-length debut, sounds exactly like the aforementioned bands. (Maybe instead of thank-you notes, those bands should be sending cease-and-desist letters.) And while plenty of bands sound like plenty of other bands -- hell, a good chunk of CD reviewing is merely pointing that out -- what's most distressing is that, as a result, the Lashes have no personality of their own. One minor aside: A buddy of mine teased me earlier this summer during a trip to the beach when I popped in Rooney's self-titled debut for a little driving music. "What is this? Inoffensive pop rock mix #1?" he cracked. My friend has a point, and it extends to the Lashes: the music cranked out by these acts is sunny, hooky and instantly disposable pop that works best when used as, well, driving music en route to the beach. Granted, this is not a crime, but it's hard to get too eager about such ephemeral music. Every track on Get It -- with the exception of the mid-tempo, string-section aided "Dear Hollywood" -- is upbeat and interchangeable-with-every-other-track-on-the-disc power pop, from the jangly single "Sometimes the Sun", the New Wavy flourishes of "The World Needs More Love Letters", and the bouncy keyboards of "Nate's Song". Trying to differentiate between these songs is like trying to pinpoint the differences between brands of toothbrushes -- they all do about the same thing, with very little variation. I mentioned that there are no actual crimes against music on Get It, but the Lashes are guilty of playing it too safe. 
christina aguilera is arguably one of the best vocalists of our time. This girl effortlessly belts out keys that can make the hairs on your arm stand up(not the annoying shrill dog whistle that mariah constantly unnecessarily throws in songs)Her talent can not be denied...her choices..well..lol Ms. Aguilera has definitely come a long way from the bubblegum sound of her first cd(which she is forgiven for). I really fell in love with her on Stripped, which in my opinion, was a brutally personal album. Her vocal were incredible, and all of her songs felt raw and uncensored. So i was definitely counting down the days to her new release. i won't say i don't like Back 2 Basics, but it was a bit of a disappointment. i understand and even appreciate her decision to do something different, but a whole "vintage" cd got a little tiring after awhile. At times (Slow Down Baby, Makes Me Wanna Pray) christina seemed to let the great music eclipse her awesome voice and that was a bit of a let down. She also had a few filler songs(Still Dirty) that seemed like an afterthought. Christina shines when plays the diva that she is...she absolutely delivers on Ain't No Other Man(think Amerie's One Thing...but by someone that can sing)and her mournful wails on Hurt are enough to make you forgive her for whatever she did. My favorite, and by far the standout track is Save Me From Myself, where Christina's gentle voice intertwines beautifully with the wistful strings of the violoin and guitar. This track is actually one of my favortie songs EVER. So while the album had material that could have been left on the cutting floor, it also offers truly beautiful music. 
I love how Christina takes on a completely persona every time she releases an album. Some might be irritated by her constantly shifting musical style, but I think it's good that she experiments. She's gotta find her groove! Even though some of the songs weren't really early 20th century inspired, like she said, they're still good. There are only a couple of songs I don't like too much on the whole album, which is pretty amazing. I also was happy to find a dedication from Christina to her fans, entitled "Thank You." I wish I could have participated in that song. Overall, Christina can no longer be shoved into that corner with Britney, Lindsay, and all the other crappy female singers out there. She has true talent, and she isn't afraid to show it! Go Christina 
It's shameful but must admit for a long time Miss Aguilera wasn't even on my radar screen but over the years her unmistakable voice has become to prevalent to ignore. Once I got hip I have to say that I have been impressed ever since. This is a classic example of a young woman taking charge of her image, career, and destiny. Interestingly enough, there is no appearance from Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am, who seems to pop up everywhere these days, but thats not a bad thing. See, in is absence, Christina has sought the powers of Gangstarr's DJ Premier (found on the intro 'Back to Basics', 'Back in the Day', 'Ain't No Other Man', 'Still Dirrty', and the fan appreciative dedication 'Thank You'), who is in top form here. This time out she has fused Hip-Hop with Pop with a liberal sprinkling of soul. This is a bona-fide hit and a nice addition to the collections of fans and newcomers alike 
These two CD's were a good combination. Her new style is really unique and awesome. She has some good meaningful songs with some of her old "dirty" ones too 
I love that this one two Disk CD. The songs were great also. 
I've never been a real big Christina fan. I remember her from the Mickey Mouse Club. She's always been a great vocalist. I've thought her music was a little bubble gum to me. She kind of caught my attention with her Stripped album. I thought two of the hits from the album were pretty good. But now... I must say that I have enjoyed this entire album!! She's all grown up. If you like Christina, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan, I recommend you give her another chance. I really liked her swing style on some of the songs. Again, A+ for this album. Hey, I might even go see her in concert now. :- 
First time I reviewed a disc here. I am a fan of rock , prog rock and jazz fusion. I love seeing bands live so lately I have been strong into the neo - hippie"jam" genre. I love strong female vocalists and always new Christina was one of the better ones . With this cds nod to early influences her abilities are channeled in the right direction. I saw the video and took a chance that there would be more like it on the disc. Hearing her sing about artists like Coltrane is so appropriate. It is a shame she broke into the scene w/ Brittany Spears and people did not know what to do w/ her. I hope she stays in this direction . I reccommend to anyone and many of my friends find it strange that I listen to this( I tell them to trust me I know what s*cks and this certainly does not) but true music fans already had a copy when I recommended. Variety is the spice of life. Enjoy-I do over and over again 
I am a big Christina fan and feel very let down by this album 
This one of the best cd's I've ever heard! I love the way Christina has taken the "40's" sound and has blended it with her unique style. A definite treasure 
After her much-praised segue into co-writing on "The Girl In the Other Room", the jazz world's favourite poster girl re-embraces the songbook with a big, British Columbia bear hug. With her trusty A-team, co-producer Tommy LiPuma, engineer Al Schmitt and arranger/bandleader John Clayton, on hand to keep interpretations fresh, Krall takes palpable delight in delivering 11 of her favourite tunes, most of which she's been singing and playing since childhood. It shows: tracks such as "Day In, Day Out", "Come Dance With Me" and "It Could Happen To You" have been reworked with obvious knowledge. Krall's skills as a pianist have never been in doubt but here her voice seems richer, her phrasing more natural, her timing very often inspired - particularly on an unhurried, soon-come version of Irving Berlin's "Isn't It A Lovely Day". It's the ensemble playing, though, which really marks this out as a good one - the thoughtful guitar of Anthony Wilson on "Exactly Like You"; Terrell Stafford's trumpet solo on "Isn't This A Lovely Day", the musical empathy throughout. Sure, it would be nice to have more Krall originals. But for the time being, here's the gal at her best. Diana Krall ( vocals, piano ), Terrell Strafford ( trumpet ), Gil Castellanos ( trumpet ), Sal Cracchiolo ( trumpet, flugelhorn), Jeff Clayton (alto sax), Rickey Woodard (tenor sax), Gerald Clayton ( piano), Tamir Hendelman ( piano), Anthony Wilson ( acoustic guitar), John Clayton ( bass ), Jeff Hamilton (drums) and the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. 
Diana Krall is simply the best contemporary singer to interpret this collection of great standards. From her throaty, torchy renditions to her supurb piano playing she represents a much welcome return to the way it should have always be done. It is getting difficult to find good jazz in the classic mode. For the purists, this is your disc 
I consider myself a Diana Krall fan...and I'm a huge Elvis Costello fan - somehow I was hoping that this union would produce some incredible music...a merging of their styles...maybe some terrific covers... I don't know - something exciting, fun, inspired. Instead I must say I find this cd pretty boring - where was Elvis? Who picked the song selection? I was hoping for so much more! 
The above title for my review reflects my feelings about Diana Krall's enjoyable talent. F.S. is my long, long, time favorite 
It took me a while to warm up to Diana Krall but once I did I was hooked. Her Live in Paris CD and DVD were awesome and I now own her entire collection. As a big fan I expected to like this new work but I liked it even more than I anticipated. Her previous work has all been in a combo setting with Piano, Bass, Drums and Guitar, on this disc she sings and plays with a full band, the Hamilton-Clayton Jazz Orchestra and the result is fabulous. Her voice, phrasing and style come through in a new and very enjoyable way with the big band behind her. I hope she chooses to reprise this format soon. 
I loved every one of Diana Krall's releases until "The Girl in the Other Room." It was a departure from her usual kind of songs, and though I tried to like it, I could not. "From This Moment On" is far better, in my opinion, but I still don't think it comes up to the standard set by her earlier releases. See if you agree, but to me it seems to feature her piano playing much less. That was a big disappointment to me. She is a great singer, but I like to hear her play too. I really missed that on this CD 
It's good to see Diana recovering from the dark recording she did with her husband 
I have been a Diana Krall fan for years. Have all her albums and play them regularly. I felt however that her heart simply was not in this album. The album lacked energy. Just to be sure, I gave it to another DK afficianado and she agreed with me. I trust that this is a career hiccup and not a trend 
This album gives us what we have come to expect from Diana Krall. She combines a smooth, throaty, feminine jazz voice with a fine understanding of the blending of lyrics and music. I would not say this album is her best. But it is as good as any, and well worth the investment 
Yeah, the rumours are true. Hate to say it, since I'm such a huge Hedwig freak. So much that I'll admit to playing the 85-minute "making of" DVD feature in the mornings as I wake up to get me going... And yet... yeah, there's sadly no soul in this CD. I wish it weren't true, but it is. Just mail $10 to Harvey Milk School and buy the sheet music to play yourself. If you'd like to buy it because you MUST own everything Hedwig, go ahead. If you're looking for good music, just stick with the original soundtracks. I mean come on! Even "They Might Be Giants" was boring on this album 
I was SO MOVED when I first watched Hedwig that I bought the DVD, Soundtrack and Broadway Soundtrack. What a masterful bit of writing and performance; just astonishing. After I listened to this tribute, I just couldn't write a positive review. The magic and emotion is not there. The feeling is gone. I know this review is short, but not much really needs to be said other than: Save your money and buy the original 
I am actually surprised at how great this album is. I am a Hedwig fan and thought that this would be a huge flop, but I bought it anyway. Every song differs from the movie and off-Broadway version, yet retains the emotions of each song. I think that the majority of the reviewers here forgot about the importance of the emotions of songs, not just the way the song sounds. There is only one flop on this album and that is the techno version of "Nailed." It's the only song that is completely out of place and it shouldn't have been in the album. Also, the reprise of "The Origin of Love," though innovative, is not on par with the rest of the album. Yet, these are only two out sixteen songs. The Breeders' "Wicked Little Town" is eloquent and well executed, as is the 3 Bens' version of the reprise. Cyndi Lauper's "Midnight Radio" is fantastic and the Polyphonic Spree's "Wig in a Box" improves a song that I already thought was perfect. The biggest surprise for me was actually JCM's "Milford Lake," which is very catchy and very deep. These songs make up for the rest of the album and this worth getting just for these songs. Overall, this album is fantastic and should be purchased 
Stephen Trask and John Cameron Mitchell's gender-bending Hedwig has gathered a cult following among film- and theater-goers and the music, as evidenced by this collection, has quickly become greatly beloved by musicians as diverse as Yoko Ono, Imperial Teen, and Fred Schneider. The passion for these songs espoused by the artists is readily apparent in all of the tracks, but unfortunately their love of the material does not always produce the greatest results. The album's highlights: Sleater-Kinney Fred Schneider's "Angry Inch" -- Sleater-Kinney's intense guitar and drum work, Corin Tucker's half-singing/half-bellowing vocals, and Fred Schneider's snide delivery perfectly capture Hedwig's angry yet tongue-in-cheek narrative of his botched sex-change operation. Frank Black's "Sugar Daddy" -- One of the albums most energetic moments, Frank Black truly embraces Hedwig's spirit of challenging notions of both sex and gender with his gravelly-almost-snarling delivery of lines like, "I'll be more woman than a man like you can stand." The Breeders' "Wicked Little Town" -- The subtle guitar work and Kim Deal's quiet, raspy vocals make this song a very beautiful, intimate encounter with The Breeders. The Polyphonic Spree's "Wig in a Box" -- This track is probably the best match of material to artist. The theatrics and ostentation of the lyrics perfectly complement The Spree's grandiose musical arrangements. Honorable mentions: Rufus Wainwright's "The Origin of Love", Spoon's "Tear Me Down," Yoko Ono Yo La Tengo's "Hedwig's Lament/Exquisite Corpse," Ben Kweller Ben Folds' "Wicked Little Town (Tommy Gnosis version)," and Cyndi Lauper The Minus 5's "Midnight Radio" The biggest disappointments: the new material (Robyn Hitchcock John Cameron Mitchell) and Bob Mould's clubby, dance take on "Nailed," which is a fun enough cover but completely strips the song of its eroticism. More of this album works than doesn't work and is a must-buy for "Hedwig" fans and indie-music lovers alike 
if you're new to Hedwig, sure, get the soundtrack. if you're stuck on the performances on the soundtrack and not the songs/spirit of it..then stick with the soundtrack. this album of covers, however, is pretty great. the choices of bands/artists are appropriate and interesting for each song. They all add their own signatures to the covers...so...I guess it helps if you're familiar with the bands on the album, but nonetheless it's a great companion to the soundtrack 
A lot of these covers are pretty good. Though, nowhere as good as John Cameron Mitchell's singing, but still worth listening. The Origin of Love - Rufus Wainwright - 8/10 Angry Inch - Fred Schneider and Sleater-Kinney - 7/10 The Long Grift - They Might Be Giants - 7/10 Sugar Daddy - Frank Black - 6/10 City of Women - Robyn Hitchcock - 8/10 Freaks - Imperial Teens - 7/10 Wicked Little Town (Hedwig's Version) - The Breeders - 9/10 Nailed (Loudbomb Remix) - Bob Mould - 8/10 Wig in A Box - The Polyphonic Spree - 9/10 Milford Lake - John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask - 10/10 Ladies Gentlemen - Stephen Colbert - 6/10 Tear Me Down - Spoon - 7/10 Hedwig's Lament/Exquisite Corpse - Yoko Ono Yo La Tengo - 5/10 - This one is HILARIOUS. Wicked Little Town (Tommy Gnosis Version) - Ben Kweller, Ben Folds, and Ben Lee - 8/10 Midnight Radio - Cyndi Lauper and Minus 5 - 10/10 The Origin of Love (reprise) - Jonathan Richman - 4/10 119/160 - B- The best tracks on this recording is Milford Lake and Midnight Radio(which was sung AMAZINGLY by Cyndi Lauper) 
While I love the music of Hedwig. I don't think these artists can't quite capture the magic of John Cameron Mitchell and Stephan Trask. Some are ok. But for the most part. It's just bad. The artists who contribute are excellent artists but their attempts to recreate the Hedwig magic is either mediorce or just plain bad 
This is a great cd to buy if you never listened to AFi. it will make you buy the other ones. if you have listened to AFI before, you definatly buy this. it is one of those CDS that you could listen to over and over agian and never get tired of i 
Is it punk? Is it goth? Alternative? Metal? Play this CD for 10 different people and I bet few of them will agree on how to categorize it. And that's one of the things that makes it great. If you were an AFI fan from their early days of three-chord songs on Answer That and Stay Fashionable, then this likely wouldn't appeal to you. This is not punk in the sense that their earlier CDs were (and yes, I have heard them). But the punk influence is still there, particularly in the vocals on "but home is nowhere" and "Bleed Black." To someone who only listens to pop on the radio, they would think this is punk. To someone who thinks Crass is real punk, they obviously wouldn't. If you look through the one-star reviews, a lot of them are from people who are mad that AFI "sold out" to sign to a major label and no longer sounds like they did when they were writing about breakfast cereal. Nor is this goth, per se, but if you only read the lyric sheet and looked at a photo of the band in this era, you might assume they are goth. Okay, on with the review: this CD is amazing. I grew up listening to old punk and goth, and yet my days of wanting to listen to those exclusively are mostly over. Life has gotten too complicated for me to invest time and energy into being concerned with categorization or "selling out." AFI appeals to that part of me that liked those styles of music, because I can still hear those influences. My favorite songs on this CD vary almost by the day, and I love each of them best at different times. From the atmospheric call to arms of "Miseria Cantare" to the incredibly energizing and almost bouncy "This Celluloid Dream," there's enough variety here to keep it interesting. It's not like listening to the same song over and over. "...but home is nowhere" is positively epic. The lyrics are worthwhile to read and commit to memory, dark and almost poetic at times. If, like me, you grew up listening to The Cure, Bauhaus, Joy Division, etc. you might just love this CD. Davey Havok and the guys in AFI are combining varied influences in an interesting, complex way. The passion in this music is undeniable. After I got this CD, it was almost three weeks before I even wanted to listen to anything else, just because I kept discovering something new with subsequent listens. All of AFI's CDs have something to offer, and I really like all of them for different reasons. But this one is a true masterpiece and a great introduction for anyone considering checking out AFI. 
Sing the Sorrow was my first introduction to AFI. Which is probably why I like it so much. I honestly find this album to be breathtaking. Its a true work of art, and a great sign of maturity from the band. The Art of Drowning is a great record, but this is really a step in a new direction for AFI. Have the sold out? Not at all. They just refined and have built off their old sound. While not abandoning the old sound completly, you can still tell that this is AFI, and there a few songs on this record that should please old AFI fans. But most the album is a step in a new direction, and I personally welcome that direction. A band can't keep creating the same album, it will get old. So no, this is not Black Sails, or Art of Drowning. But its a dang good record, and based off the number of copies it sold, alot of people think its dang good as well. Is Sing the Sorrow a masterpiece? That's probably a toss up. I personally feel that it is, but many would disagree with me. Regardless, this was a very influential album for many people,it brought AFI legions of new fans; and with good reason. I honestly don't have one single problem with this record, its fantastic from begining to end. I know a number of people who are old AFI fans don't like this album, but your missing out if you feel that way. Much like decemberunderground, its different, but different doesn't mean bad. I will admitt that I'm much more a fan of the new AFI than older AFI, although I do really dig the Art of Drowning. Onto the songs. The Leaving Song part 2 is fantastic song, and its actually the song that got me interested in AFI in the first place. I love Daveys vocals on this track, they are strong and powerful. Bleed Black is great song as well, maybe not as strong as The Leaving Song, but its great nonetheless, with some great riffs. Silver and Cold may be one of the best tracks on the album. Its a beautiful and haunting song. Davey does a fantastic job on this song, he sounds amazing. Next up is Dancing Through Sunday, and it is much faster and harder than Silver and Cold, more a old school AFI song than anything else on the album so far. Great track and chorus. Girls Not Grey follows up next, and while its certainly is a great track, its not as strong as Leaving Song or Silver and Cold. Up next is probably my favorite track, Death of Seasons. Incredible song. Its by far the hardest song on the album so far, with Davey doing more screaming. I love the feeling that this song gives you, it even has a little electronica portion to it. It has some great hooks to it, and it's some of the strongest riffs and bass lines in the whole album. The Great Disappointment is next, and its another strong addition, with a great chorus. On the UK version of this album, there is 2 extra tracks, and one of them is entitled, Synesthesia. If you havnt heard that song you need to check it out. It has quickly become one of my favorite AFI tracks, its very well done. Its a shame it wasnt included in the US release. Anyways, give this album a chance, go into with a open mind. This is a powerful,moving and addictive album. Alot of value can be found here if you dig into it a little bit 
This is a song by song breakdown of AFI's sing the sorrow. Miseria Cantare-An appropriate beginning to a suitably dark mainstream album. That said, for all the claims to Davey Havok's voice being clear, it sounds as though he's hiccuping throughout the song. The leaving song part 2-Catchy, though after many repeated listens, the song will feel incomplete Bleed black-Odd intro, though the song picks up after a few seconds on what is likely the second most beautiful riff on the album, rivalled only by the great dissapointment. Unfortunately, they break into a less-than-sensical 3/4 time change seemingly aimed at ADD-addled kids. Silver and cold-Another pointless intro, save for the piano. A nice break from the loud guitars and cellos that occupy the rest of the record. Not particularly concise lyrics, though. "Light/like the flutter of wings/feel your hollow bones rushing/into me/as you're longing to say.../now/I will bet you in silver... Dancing through sunday-Unmemorable solo. And there are only so many times you can mention the word "misery" within a two minute-song. Otherwise solid. Girl's not grey-This one is rather slight, as if geared for radio play. Also, it seems mixed differently from the others. Otherwise fairly catchy. Death of seasons-Awesome intro. Sadly, the techno break before the second verse goes nowhere. Also changed tempos, making the song longer than it probably should be. The great disappointment-Including lyrics, which are almost cynical in their whining misery. Luckily, the best bass riff, along with programming and cellos(i think)help this overwrought bus stop anthem turn into a dark masterpiece. Paper airplanes(makeshift wings)-The usual lyrics about Hollywood fasion models, even more cynical than the great dissapointment. It sounds urgent, though, and may evoke images of the 80's. This celluloid dream-By now it is generally understood that the band is not big on taking solos, but this is one of the catchier pieces. The leaving song-Finally, the band write in something other than a sharp or flat. Acoustics work well. ...But home is nowhere-Suitably epic closer, complete with laughably overwrought spoken interlude("in our cancer of passion, you said'Death is a midnight runner'")and crowd-pleasing ballad. There are some annoyances to be stated, such as pointless seconds of silence before songs begin(bleed black has snoring noises that make me forget that bleed black is awesome)davey's thin high-register voice, and even thinner lyrics. But overall, a satisfying liste 
The album Sing the Sorrow by A.F.I is a great CD which has many different songs that are great lyrically and musicly. They have three great hits on one CD. Becuse the CD follows one theme, so if you like one song than you will like the entire CD. So i reccomend this CD to any Punk Rocker out there who likes a little screaming 
My AFI knowledge before this cd was limited to a few songs such as Days Of The Phoenix, Total Immortal, Wester, and Dream Of Waking which are all great songs. But this album blew me away because it was so unique and every song kicks my a**. Every track is done masterfully from the lyrics and Davies voice, the ravaging guitar riffs, and the pounding drums. Through and through a solid cd no song sounds the same and each brings its own knockout punch. Easily one of my favorite cds, and one of few I can listen to start to finish without skipping a song. Miseria Cantare (The Beginning) 8/10 Powerfull opening track sets the mood, builds and climaxes to all out chanting. The Leaving Song Pt. 2 10/10 Davey's yelling and Jades guitar rules on this song especially during the chorus and the bridge. Bleed Black 10/10 My second favorite track, stunning song all the way through. Silver and Cold 10/10 Builds slowly at the beginning to a melodic and amazing chorus, one of the more widely recognized songs from the cd. Dancing Through Sunday 9/10 Reminiscent of the AFI of old, a solid hi tempto song with a ripping guitar solo from Jade. Girl's Not Grey 10/10 Their first single from the album easily distinguishable as a radio song with catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Death of Season 9/10 Fast paced loud in your face track, with a very soft melodic ending. The Great Disappointment 10/10 A slow but great intro until about 1.5 minutes in then it kicks it up a notch. Lyrically amazing, (While I waited I was wasting away) one of the most overlooked songs on the cd. Paper Airplanes (Makeshift Wings) 10/10 Easily another stand out song which transitions in flow so well. A fast paced a**-kicker. The Celluloid Dream 10/10 In my opinion the best song on the album, the intense guitar riffs make the song exceptionally elite. The Leaving Song 10/10 Who knew there would be a ballad! And that it would be so good, davey and the gang shows depth musically by pulling this off, emotionally a great softer song. ...But Home Is Nowhere 10/10 An amazing way to finish before the bonus tracks they end it on a high note, chanting and ripping on the guitar, definitely AFI at its best. This Time Imperfect 9/10 Meaningfull and emotional track. Synesthesia 10/10 Vintage AFI, unmistable quick paced pounding drums, vocals, and guitar. My first impression of Decemberunderground is that it falls short compared Sing The Sorrow, not because DU is bad, but rather that STS is that good. Many longtime fans appear to immediately dismiss this album and go as far to say they sold out with a major record label, but it is clearly a sign of evolution and a step in the right direction 
AFI-Sing The Sorrow **** While not totaly abandening their roots AFI managed to find a newer more commercial sound on their major label debut SIng The Sorrow. Instead of full blown hardcore punk they find a darker more emotional form of rock on most of their songs. THe guitar is played as well as it always has been and the ryhthm section is great as well. Davey Havoks vocals are better then before and at times so are his lyrics. Though as I said the band didnt totaly move away from their punk roots I am happy to report. They still keep that old Misfits influence alive and well here on Sing The Sorrow. Songs like 'Dancing Through Sunday' 'Death Of Seasons' and 'Paper Airplanes (Makeshift Wings)' keep the Punk fell alive. With chainsaw guitars and ferious vocals from Havok it's no wonder AFI reaceved such a following after the release of Sing The Sorrow. 'The Leaving Song Part 2' 'Girls Not Grey' and 'Silver and Cold' were all hit singles got the band especially 'Silver And Cold.' 'The Leaving Song Part 2' is easily the best song on the album and in my opinion is the best song the band ever made even better then most of the songs on Black Sails. This singles made this album the biggest rock/emo album the year it was released, everyone had it. The rest of the album is great as well. Songs like 'Bleed Black' and the techno-esq 'The Great Dissapointment' are great song that really add to teh albums feel and all around sound. So this more commercial sound for the band is not a band thing but really a pretty good thing. My only problem with this is I am a major fan of the AFI of old like Black Sails. So for me this album would have been much better if they had more material that sounded like their younger material. But it is still a great album that I would recomend to all fans of modern rock 
Overrated. Not as epic as it could be. "The Lion King" is Disney's true musical masterpiece. Most of the songs have nice tunes but get old after about the tenth time. There are only a few great ones: "If I Can't Love Her", "Human Again" and of course "Beauty and the Beast". Still a really great show and once more a great album. 
Beauty and the Beast is total family entertainment. The music is awesome and clever- great voices wonderful to watch. Teaches upstanding morals. Other classics not to forget about are: Mary Poppins My Fair Lady The Wizard of Oz Chitty Chitty Bang Band The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Sound of Music Oliver West Side Story Fiddler on the Roof Singing in the Rain The Wiz Little Mermaid Aladdin Beauty and the Beast Grease The King and I Oklahoma The Music Man South Pacific My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals 
In my opinion, "Beauty and the Beast" is the most romantic movie of Disney that I'll never forget. I have been eager to see the musical for a long time, but I haven't had a chance to see yet. Then I bought this record, in order to feel the liveliness of the stage, I really felt it and I'm eagerer to see the musical! Needless to say, all the songs in the movie were taken to the musical. But the difference is that the stage made all the songs performed more vigorously. Especially songs that performed by many performers, for example, "Be Our Guest" "Belle" "Human Again" and so on. The melody was almost the same with the original versions in the movie, but the musical instruments as if have been changed a little. I seem that I saw all the actors and actresses played the characters in "Beauty and the Beast", what a vigorous spectacle! And I felt that a miracle of love was taken into reality! There are many songs that were adapted from the scores in the movie. Then one I love best is "Home". It's very beautiful, and it has good lyric. It reflected Belle's emotion absolutely. The voice of the actress who played Belle is lovely, and it's very similar to Belle's dubber in the movie, Paige O'Hara's. The song "If I Can't Love Her" is wonderful too, I love the voice of the Beast very much. "Transformation" impressed me much, this plot in the movie hadn't got song to sing, but Belle sang the melody of "Home", it made this plot more impressive. And the last few sentences that Belle and the Beast sang together made us felt the great power of love, a miracle which occurred just because of true love! I think this broadway musical recording is one of the best, it's even better than The Lion King's. I really want to see this musical. I was told that this musical has been taken to Shanghai several years ago, but I missed it! However, I would never miss it if this musical came to China again. And I have decided to see the musical of The Lion King in Shanghai this summer vocation 
Well, what can I say. "Beauty and the Beast," was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was growing up. I was 10 when I saw it in the theatres. I'm 24 now, and my girlfriend and I have tickets to see this show done as a musical at Mill Mountain Theatre in Roanoke. She and I are both very young at heart, so when I bought this recording, I had to share it with her. This wonderful recording contains virtually all the songs from the film, plus some additional new gems. "Something There," makes me cry every time I hear that cut. This CD is well worth owning 
I bought this CD when I went to see the musical when I was 6 (I'm 16 now). It was burried in my closet for the longest time, and I found it in the summer. Since then, I have not been able to stop listening to it! The music is so beautiful. All of the voices match the characters perfectly, and they sing so wonderfully! The orchestra is amazing, and they compliment the singers perfectly. The tunes are so catchy, and the lyrics are so perfect and witty! This CD can take you away to a different world, and make you believe that you are living in a dark castle in a French provincial town. My favourite songs include Belle, No Matter What, Home, Be Our Guest (of course!), If I Can't Love Her, the Entr'acte (that orchestra is wonderful!), and the End Transformation. I know it sounds like a lot, but they're all so wonderful! If I had to choose just one favourite, it would be "Home." Susan Egan is the perfect Belle, and I get goosebumps every time I listen to it. I've lent this CD to all my friends, and we all love it. I hope you love this CD as much as I do 
Susan is amazing - simply put. The rest of the cast shines as well. Everytime i listen to this CD "home" gives me chills. 
I had the fortune of seeing this wonderful show performed twice. Each time I felt more amazed and enchanted then the time I first saw it. The sets, the costumes, make the show visually appealling but, the true magic of the show lasts in the newly added songs. Susan Egan is the perfect choice as the strong willed Belle- totally emboding her spirit in this recording. Terrance Mann made a breakthrough performance his version of "If I Can't Love Her"is beautiful and added new depth to the character of the Beast. The music and the show will never be forgotten- the hits such as "Tale As Old As Time" and "Something There" are just as beautiful as they were in theaters and make you love the show even more. With a great cast of unknowns at the time, beautiful music, and simply magical sets/costumes. "Beauty and the Beast" is not a show you should miss if your visiting New York. But, if you like myself don't have the chance to see that show as often as you like or to ever see it the C.D. is a good subsitute. Grown-ups will LOVE the newly added "Me" which is one of my personal favorites, and "If I Can't Love Her." Once again fitting in well with the orginal movie. The show only ENHANCES the qualities you enjoyed in the movie and the story. The story being altered slightly to make it more enjoyable for adults. After you listen to the C.D. you'll be amazed at Disney's first attempt at Broadway and how magical the show is... this is definately a C.D. I would own wether your a Broadway fan, music lover, Disney fan, or simply a fan of the movie. This C.D. is simply magical 
I just saw the show on saturday and I fell in love with the music. I have been a fan of this story for many many years, since I saw the movie when I was four years old when it first came into theaters. I am now 17 years old and I am listening to this cd or the movie cd 15 times a day, even during school. This cd is by far the best recording of the disney music that we all know and love. If you don't have this soundtrack, GET IT ASAP!!!!!!!! It will be worth the money you pay for it. Trust me, your whole family will love it so much, they will make you take them to New York City to see the show. And you will love that even more 
I have listened samples of 5 Callas CDs before buying this one. This one has a very beautiful collection of songs on just 2 CDs. he sings with so much expression. Most the recordings are from the fifties and early sixties when her voice was very young and lovely. I'll try to get her on DVD so I can see her sing 
I would just like to refer to an article that was published by a German Newspaper in 1959, mentioned on the Callas Edition (CED:100342) '...her voice is of unparalleled beauty, having an inimitable, completely own timbre of sopranos and altos...a performance of superior musical quality..a phenomenon amongst contemporary singers' ' ...One of the most spectacular Verdi arias, of Elizabeth from Don Carlo, and one, In Germany tottaly unknown, terrific scene from Bellini's opera Il Pirata were enough to enchant huge numers of television viewers, who can say at her next performance: 'we have seen La Callas''(Hamburg concert 1959) '- from the contra-alt-f to the f - thats Callas' voice range, spanning over 37 half-tones. Callas herself has drawn the range of her voice. In her concert repertoire the contra-alt-f can be found in e.g. the aria from I Vespri Siciliani. In an aria from Rossini's opera Armida she reaches the 'F'. five half-tones above the high C. Normal voices couldnt possibly even whistle this high F. Though there are other singers, whose voices contain these three octaves - Erna Sack with her coloratura soprano, the lyrical singer Ema Berger and the dramatical singer Zinka Milanov from the New York Metropolitan Opera - simple fact is that the phenomenon Meneghini-Callas lies in her fabulous vocal versatility. She is a coloratura singer, drama-player and lyrist in one person - and an exceptionally talented ac-tress at that.' Excuse from a journalist of the German Newspaper for the Diva : Article Title : 'I am sorry!' 'I owe Maria Callas an apology. She is a unique vocal talent, a great artist. She is a primadonna. And she has her moods. Moods for which i ask her to forgive me. Because i misunderstood them - and many others too. That much i gathered from her latest television concert. Even in the flickering of the screen this woman's nervousness and enormous effort were visible. La Callas is a fragile, rather shy person. Her moods are fear of failure. The moloch audience expects her to always go to any lenght, show the brilliance others just dont have. She is not allowed to get weak. Decent country singers are not decapitated for a false note. La Callas, on the other hand, is the identifying mark of the extraordinary. Even the slightest hint of a mistake would cost her her uniqueness, her stardom....a perverse triumph for all bathtube singers. That explains her inhibitation to perform when she isnt well, her cancellations when she is not in the right mood. I understand them now. If she werent moody, she wouldnt be a primadonna, would not be La Callas. Stars like her do not fit in our world of standards and programmed data. They pay dearly for their moods, have to put up fights and, undoubtedly, shed many a tear. So one more, my apologies, Maria Callas' (Hans im Bild) That's all folks!: 
My goodness, what is a non-musical person like Holly Mathews doing in this board? Do you know what other album she has reviewed? Hayley Westenra! And she's not even an opera singer! She obviously doesn't know her business! Disgraceful review! Ignore it! It obviously was not based on good judgement. I'm sure she is a pop fan who just likes tender music. Oh, her insulting language! What an ignorant Maria basher! Anyway, this is an excellent compilation of SOME of Maria Callas' greatest arias. Although I do wish some arias like Pace Pace Mio Dio were included here, I do think it is a very good compilation all in all. Although she has many detractors, they still have to admit that Callas is the sheer embodiment of singing and drama. She was an actress...a panther on the stage. Listen to her La Mamma Morta and her Suicidio...those brought chills to my spine when I listened to them. Maria is the only singer in the history of opera besides the great Caruso-tenor Franco Corelli who touched me, moved me even. This is probably the reason why I love Maria Callas' music so much. If you want to hear Medea's anger and Norma's anguish and Butterfly's hopeful blindness, listen to Maria Callas. If you just want a golden voice, then go to Renata Tebaldi or Joan Sutherland. And don't even compare her with Charlotte Church or Hayley Westenra! The distaste of some people 
THIS WAS THE FIRST ALBUM I EVER BOUGHT FEATURING ANY OPERATIC SOPRANO. I WAS 15 AND WAS GIVEN MY VERY FIRST CLASSICAL PIECE "CARO MIO BEN" WHICH WAS NOT AN OPERA ARIA BUT DUE TOTHIS SONG I WAS SUDDENLY IN LOVE WITH OPERA. I HAD HEAR OF HER A FEW TIMES IN THE PAST BUT MY IDEA OF A GOOD SOPRANO AT THE TIME WAS SARAH BIRGHTMAN (YES I KNOW I KNOW!!!BUT I WAS YOUNG!)BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO REALIZE HOW WRONG I WAS!! THIS CALLAS RECORDING HAD THE MOST PROFOUND EFFECT ON ME WHICH LED TO MY OBSESSION WITH MY OWN OPERATIC ASPIRATIONS. IT WAS STRANGE AS SHE DID NOT SOUND LIKE A FAT WOMAN SCREAMING HER HEAD OFF IN FULL BODY ARMOR. YES YES...I AND MANY MANY SAD AMERICANS HAVE THOUGH OF THIS WHEN GIVEN THE WORD OPERA. (NOW NOW, WE ALL FELT LIKE THAT AT SOME POINT) I NEVER REALIZED THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH PASSION. HER NORMA WAS IS SO BEAUTIFUL IN IT'S SIMPLICITY AND UNDERLINING STRENGTH. HER TAKE ON "COME OER ME SERENO" AND "UNA VOCE POCO FA" WERE SWEET AND APPROPRIATELY INNOCENT. HER BEL CANTO ROLES WHICH INCLUDED HER FANTASTIC LUCIA (ALTHOUGH LATER I WOULD PREFER SUTHERLAND) AND GILDA JUST THRILLED ME. I HAD NO IDEA SOMEONE COULD ACTUALLY SING THOSE PIECES! OF COURSE UP UNTIL THIS POINT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OPERA COULD SOUND LIKE THAT!! (SILLY ME!) I WAS SURPRISED TO REALIZED I KNEW THE ARIAS SHE SUNG FROM LA BOHEME, LA TRAVIATA, AND MADAME BUTTERFLY. THEY DIDN'T MAKE A HUGE IMPRESSION BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THE FIREWORKS I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT I STILL FOUND THEM TO BE BEAUTIFUL. AFTER ALL OF THIS I LANDED ON CALLAS' TAKE OF TOSCA'S "VISSI D'ARTE". IT WAS AND HAS BEEN THE ONLY TIME I'VE BEEN SO MOVED BY A PERFORMER THAT I CRIED. IT WAS SO PURE BUT THE PAIN WAS SO EVIDENT THAT IT JUST CHILLED ME. I MUST HAVE LISTENED TO IT THOUSANDS OF TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND STILL HAVE YET TO HEAR A MORE STIRRING RENDITION. DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING FIRST CD I MUST ADMIT I KIND OF IGNORED THE SECOND HALF. EVENTUALLY I DID GET TO IT AND FOUND WHAT I FELT WAS THE GREATEST SONG EVER WRITTEN. MY WHOLE BEING LIVED FOR LAKME'S BELL SONG. AFTER LISTENING TO HER I WAS CONVINCED THIS WOMAN WAS MAGICAL BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW SHE OR ANY HUMAN COULD SING LIKE THAT! HER SECOND DISC WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT WENT FROM WHITE HOT COLORATURA TO MEZZO? AAHHH BUT YES SHE WENT THERE. INTO THE INTENSITY OF SAMSON ET DELILA. I THOUGHT THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL!!! OF COURSE I KNOW PREFER MARILYN HORNE TO CALLAS ON THOSE SONGS....BUT IT SHOWED ME THAT NOT EVERY SONG HAS TO BE HIGH TO BE BEAUTIFUL. I LOVED AND STILL DUE LOVE THIS COLLECTION....IN FACT I HAVE BOUGHT IT THREE TIMES AS MINE DETERIORATED QUICKLY 'CAS I PLAYED THEM SO MUCH! AND I'VE GIVEN THIS COLLECTION TO COUNTLESS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION OF CALLAS' WORK AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE! VIVA LA DIVA 
Maria Callas was never an artist one could understand or "get" as one could an can some vanilla-voices or light artists. Yet, if one listens with an open heart everything about her is revealed in her singing, a gift to art and a gift to her audience. The first CD starts with her signature piece, Norma's "Casta Diva", an aria she like no other Norma sang to ultimate perfection, both vocally and as a performer. She sang it as Bellini wrote it for his beloved muse Giuditta Pasta. Glorious coloratura, awesome glissandi and a myriad of vocal colours that shames all other Normas and especially those that are "merely" showing off how pretty their voices are. Yes, I am absolutely convinced that not even a handful in the catalogue does Bellini's masterpiece true justice. The next track is the other famous Pasta-role as written by Bellini (This is one reason why I think that lyric coloraturas like Dessay shouldn't do Amina, it was written for a dramatic coloratura). Amina's first aria is exquisitely sung, beautifully innocent and sweet. Rossini's Rosina sounds wicked and funny, Verdi's Gilda innocently in love, the same maestro's Violetta deliriously in love with life and fun, Puccini's Mimi is beautifully tender... Disc 2 features her in French repertoire, some of these even in mezzo-roles (Carmen, Dalilah) Her Carmen and Dalilah sound sexy and smoky but COMPLETELY different colour-wise as they're different characters (You won't get that from any other singer!), her Alceste and Lakme a gorgeous to say the least. Then there's Chimene's lament from "Le Cid".... ANYONE who doesn't "get" the Callas-miracle only needs to listen to this and if she won't touch your heart here then you've got none, trust me! Her "Pleurez mes yeux" is chilling, moving and gripping. Her singing Orpheus' lament isn't easy listening, it's a lament after all and her pitieful cries for Euridice are absolute tear-jerkers. It end with an unusually marked "Depuis le jour", a compilation every operafan needs as it is a great testimony of the opera-genius Maria La Divinissima Callas 
Maria Callas had an amazing voice. I find it to be very beautiful and moving. She had the ability of becoming the character she was portraying and combined with an exquisite technique we get what is called "The voice of the century". Viva La Callas, she is amazing 
If there is, the title goes to the Prima Donna del Mondo, Maria Callas. I never understood the bashers saying her voice wasn't beautiful. It's like always eating vanilla icecream and because that tastes good, one never gives other flavors a chance. And Callas had all those flavours in her voice. Innocent light colours, jealousy, love, hatred, madness, fear, anguish... It's all there. She's not a singing machine but a human being. Art is human, not mechanic science. Why isn't she forgotten her last performance being about 40 years ago? I'll tell you why with a quote: "She, more than others, gave opera its truest meaning!" Having a nice voice isn't enough, how many pretty voices have come and gone? This compilation is a timeless masterpiece and belongs in every Opera-Collection 
Callas is the voice of the century! PERIOD! Anyone comparing a lyric coloratura to Callas' powerful soprano sfogato should check the facts again. Callas rules my world 
Nothing like a bunch of multi-millionaires telling the saps who buy their CDs what a sorry state the nation is in. There are a few promising tunes on the CD but it's mostly the usual bilge being spewed by today's wannabe-activist musical acts. Save your money and download the songs you like from iTunes. As for Moveon.org -- their relevance has come and gone. Most of the kids buying this CD probably don't even know the original purpose of this passe, discredited organization. In summary, this is true bleeding heart feel good junk. Shut up and sing 
Political issues aside, this is one great album, period. I had an opportunity to listen to it when the dust from the 2004 Presidential Election had settled, and was floored by the quality of the contributions of the diverse artists, many of which are alternate or live versions of other songs you may have heard before. When you think of the many acts that joined in to make the "Future Soundtrack..." a reality, it's tough to choose any favorites. Whether you know the bands or not, my guess is you will enjoy most of the tracks. This is something rare in this type of recording (a typical case that comes to mind about how these tend to sound is a triple-CD album that was released to help Tibet, most of which was terrible). In the "Future Soundtrack for America" there's the veterans: R.E.M., Tom Waits, The Flaming Lips, David Byrne; as well as several younger acts coming up strong. All of them give themselves into this album "like there's no tomorrow" and the result is one solid album from end to end, with 20 great tracks bound to stick around. You could have bought it for the cause it stood for, back in 2004. The truth is today it is still great music, and it will continue to be so for a good while. And if you think I am doing this for political reasons, let me share a little bit with you: I normally listen to the music in an album first, and only after many, many times, do I sit down to pay attention to the lyrics. That hasn't yet happened with this album, and I already love it 
I really enjoyed this record and the proceeds go to a great cause. (Moveon.org is the best thing to happen to politics in a long time.) It's got 22 tracks so its a good value for your money. I particularly enjoyed the David Byrne, Flaming Lips, and Old 97 tracks. 
I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else. Though primarily focused on "indie" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies "This Will Be Our Year", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's "Move On", Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic "Sam Stone", and the late Elliott Smith's "A Distorted Reality...", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the "acoustic" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's "Everything's Ruined" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of "Date With The Night" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause. 
I absolutely love this CD. The songs while *very* diverse in style, are consistently strong. I think that the producers did a great job assembling the songs for this CD, 22 in all. Each of your penny worth... Great 
While I like about half of these bands music, it is just another spasm of moronic idiocy. Any college kid can get this palp form their professors. They don't need some know it all musician telling them the way it is! I mean, get a real job and see how it is. If you challenged any one of these guys to a debate I guarentee you would be dissapointed, if not a little emberassed for them. But hey, if you want to follow along like just antoher lemming, be my guest 
This really is an amazing collection of artists/songs. Praise the advent of the protest CD because I don't see how these band would otherwise all come together. There are a few songs that are so-so, but by-in-large this CD is amazing 
"A Mighty Wind" is an absolute hoot, especially if you've watched this troupe of actors through their progression of mockumentaries in "This is Spinal Tap," "Waiting for Guffman", and "Best in Show." The movie manages to be both touching and hysterical, no small feat. I always think that soundtracks are a hit or miss thing, and this soundtrack is definitely a hit. The songs from the movie are basically all included, with the special perk that we get to hear several entire songs that were only in the film in segments. The amazing thing about this album is that the songs were written and performed by the actors, and this is no simplistic, ho-hum stuff. The intricacy of the harmonies and accompaniments to the great melodies make the album worth a lot in its own right, let alone as a movie soundtrack. My favorite two songs are "When You're Next to Me" and "The Good Book Song." The former, featuring the awesome talents of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, is such a beautiful duet. And I'm hoping to include the latter during a worship service at my church. What a fun way to explain the profound truth that we would be better off if we would just do what the good book says!! I'm not a particularly big fan of folk music, and I'm not a particularly big fan of movie soundtracks. And this is one of the best albums that we own! 
I saw "The Might Wind" on cable, by chance. I was taken in by it and could not turn it off. I had to watch it from the beginning when I saw it was on again! Now, every time I chance upon it when I am channel surfing, there it goes again... my inability to change the channel! I had to buy the CD. I got it from Amazon.com today and it has been in my CD player since. The songs are great - the performances in the movie were great. And I keep hearing songs that trigger memories from the movie and can't help but chuckle. WHAT TALENT THEY ALL HAVE!! 
While the movie A Mighty Wind may not be as funny as Christopher Guest's other movies (though I personally think it is), it might actually be a better movie, largely due to the music. Yes, it's supposed to be a parody, but the music is very enjoyable. The tunes by the Folksmen (Guest, McKean, Shearer) could almost be taken completely seriously, but they do throw in a couple of jokes in their songs. I love their sound. Blood on the Coal by the Folksmen doesn't appear in the movie, but it's one of their best songs. Loco Man and Old Joe's Place are also great. I would love to see full length releases from the Folksmen. I greatly prefer the Folksmen to Spinal Tap (featuring the same 3 actors/musicians). I'm really sad that all we have from this group are a few songs on this soundtrack. Mitch and Mickey (Levy and O'Hara) can be taken completely seriously. I don't find any jokes in their songs and they're all love songs. The harmony between Levy and O'Hara is beautiful. A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow is probably the best song on the CD and it was nominated for an Academy Award. That song and the situation in the movie creates a very poignant mood. The Ballad of Bobby and June is also particularly good, in which Bobby tries to make it back from the Civil War to his June. I believe this is another awesome song not featured in the film. I would also love to see real releases from Mitch and Mickey. The New Main Street singers are very goofy and their songs aren't as good. There's nothing serious about this group. I love Potato's in the Paddy Wagon, featuring Jane Lynch and Parker Posey sharing the verses. The Good Book Song, written and lead by John Michael Higgins, is also great due to its hilarious "what if" questions of the Bible. It could use one more verse, though. I don't care for their other songs very much. The title track performed by the entire cast is great. The Folksmen and Mitch and Mickey each sing one verse and the song is perfect because its a classic folk song that would have been a huge hit in the 60s until a subtle joke at the end. I love it! You've read the reviews and you know that everyone that has this CD loves it. These actors have more musical ability than most pop/rock musicians today and certainly more than actors turned musicians. The songs were all written or co-written by the actors. Do not hesitate to buy it. It will leave you wanting more from the groups. I understand that these groups went on a small tour when the movie came out and I'm very sorry that I missed it 
After renting the movie we liked it enough to get the DVD and the soundtrack album. If you grew up listening to the likes of the Kingston Trio, New Christy Minstrels, Rooftop Singers, and any of the other folk groups of the late 50s to mid sixties you'll appreciate this homage to their songs and styles. The songs on this CD, although somewhat tongue-in-cheek, are every bit as good as the popular folk songs of that era, which is what makes this album so listenable. The whole family loves it; even our teenagers ask us to listen to it on road trips. Note: this CD includes a version of the Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up" as performed by "The Folksmen", and it is NOT edited as was the Stones' recent performance of the song at the Super Bowl. "Kumbaya", indeed 
I enjoyed this CD quite a lot. I use a lot of music in my english as a second language classes. This music is perfect because it is clear and easy to follow. Personally I just like to listen to it. I have KISS AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW memorized. My kids like it too 
You've already heard the many wonderful comments about Mitch and Mickey and the truly, truly beautiful songs they've done. But, there's more. Some may not realize that except for "Kiss at the end of the rainbow" which was yet another beautiful song, which was written by McKean and O'toole, all the rest of the Mitch and Mickey songs were written by Eugene Levy! When you're next to me (my favorite), One more time (with Catherine O'hara) and The Ballad of Bobby and June. Now, I don't know about you, but this surprised the heck outta me. I've always considered Levy to be a hilarious guy and a talented actor, even a comic genius but he worte, played and sang these songs as did Ohara. And they were EXCELLENT songs! I too, want, nay demand a Mitch and Mickey album WITH these songs and many more on them! And I want Levy to be writing most of them! I can't speak highly enough about these tunes. They transcend the whole of what the movie was even trying to get out there. I'd give this CD TEN stars if they let me. -Rick Lundee 
Don't get me wrong, Robben Ford is one of my favorite players, but to my ears, his playing on this is boxed in by the dated, slickly produced "LA" sound that, like a straightjacket, never lets the guitar parts breathe. Organic and soulful it ain't. If your taste runs to mainstream rather than fusion jazz-- that is, you prefer the sound of acoustic piano and Hammond B3 over synths and plastic -sounding "keyboards", you may prefer to smaple some other title such as "Handfull of Blues". If you like Yellowjackets, mid to late Steely Dan,Weather Report, etc., you'll probably love this. Call me a purist, but I don't connect emotionally with this at all, and the guitar playing sure ain't to blame!!!!!! 
this album is unbelieveably great. i love every song which is a rare occurence. even the two tracks with vocals are very well done. i bought this about the same time i bought "jungle fever" by neil larson and they remain 2 of my very favorite albums 
More so even than Larry Carlton, Robben Ford blazed the guitar trail with a unique style in the late 1970's which became known as the "LA" sound. It was true jazz fusion: Really complex and innovative harmonic ideas fused with rock and blues power. If you want to know where it started, listen to this album. Robben plays so well, that if you're a guitar player, you'll be heading to the woodshed, fast! And to top it off, you get some great blues ("North Carolina") as well. This album is so good, I'd give it ten stars 
Except for a couple import hard to find albums, this marked guitarist Robben Fords 1979 debut. Here he serves notic that no prisoners will be taken. Simply put, this is one of the greatest jazz/fusion releases ever! Robben and band simmer and smoke, all the while playing from the heart. I would be hard pressed to name another guitar album where jazz and rock so wonderfully coexist. Only Larry Carltons 1977 debut self titled album comes to mind, and Larry is usually honest enough to admit he stole Robben Fords trip! Buy this cd immediately and you will not be sorry. If you like this, search out Buzz Feiten, Mike Landau, Dann Huff, Larry Carlton, and Tim Pierce 
Anyone with a taste for blues/jazz done with some real creative approaches will love this first solo effort of Robben Ford! I've been carting around an old beat up cassette for years of this and now I have the CD! This early diversion by Robben into the jazz/fusion side of things is a treat made all the sweater by the Yellowjackets beginings. For my money, Robben Ford is one of the most inspiartional guitarists, singers, writers, I 've heard in a long time and this CD is amost for your collection. I love that groove on "North Carolina " !!! 
I bought this in vinyl in '79 or '80 having never heard of Robben Ford and was blown away. I jonesed through several years after my turntable broke, until I found this import CD. Now I can get my fix again, which I do quite regularly. Well worth the import price. And what did I do with the vinyl, you ask? I framed it 
This is my favorite Robben Ford recording. The tunes are invigorating, original, and the vocal cuts are incredible. This is the one CD I would take if stranded on an island 
I have played this CD more than any other in my many thousand CD collection in the last year. Amos sings in a clear honest voice that is a about half an octave higher than one expects to hear with this kind of music. As such he sounds both worldly-wise and earnest. The instumentation is simple and accomplished. While it's mentioned much, this is really classic Southern Blues music more than anything else. It is a deeply satisfying album 
I ordered this CD after seeing Amos Lee on Austin City Limits. I agree he is the next James Taylor and regret I missed his appearance in Atlanta. 
Amos Lee is by far someone you have to hear. His soulful voice, his beautiful melodies...a must have in your cd collection. It will be one of your best purchases 
NEW YORK (Blue Note Records) - Amos Lee has recently begun recording his sophomore release for Blue Note. The Philadelphia native is tracking in his home city with the assistance of producer Barrie Maguire. A prolific writer at 27, Lee is in the process of whittling down a wealth of great new material he's penned since his successful self-titled debut. The album will document the soulful stylings of this exciting young singer/songwriter who is growing artistically by leaps and bounds. Lee recorded the album in Los Angeles and his hometown Philadelphia after a prodigious writing period that yielded over 50 new songs. The New Album album is called 'Supply and Demand' and it will be released october 3rd! Amos Lee vocals, guitar; Nate Skiles guitar, mandolin, vocals; Chris Joyner piano, organ, Wurlitzer; Jaron Olevsky bass, piano, vocals; Fred Berman drums, percussion, vocals Produced by Barrie Maguire Blue Note Records 200 
Amos Lee has a voice like a new set of guitar strings. (You may quote me.) I saw him on Austin City Limits, same show as John Prine. Became instantly hooked on his soulful style. Enjoy 
I really am enjoying this album. It has a good mix of music to keep it interesting. Really nice for relaxing. Good soulful lyrics - very nice acoutic music for creating a mood. I definitely recommend this 
Amos is wonderful, steady, soulfull, emotional, raw, soothing...the list is endless...he is truly destined for big things. His music is pure, sweet, melodic, caressing to my soul. I saw him on Austin City Limits quite by accident and I haven't stopped listening to him daily since three weeks ago. He is going to take the country by storm with his talent. This is a wonderful compellation of orginals by a great talent. I wish there were more cds to buy 
I am quite taken with this new voice, Amos Lee. He speaks to me about life and the troubles of life. But he also sings of romance and family love that keep us all going and wishing for our childhood again. My favorite track is "Arms of a Woman," it is a beautiful love song about what it feels like to be in love with a woman. This feeling stays with you long after she is gone. I can listen to this track over and over because it is pretty. "Keep it Loose, Keep it Tight" is a song about trying to stay true to yourself while searching for what makes you happy. "Black River" is a great song that makes you forget all your problems. This song really puts your mind at ease. Some of these tracks sound like something you would hear during a jam session just playing and having fun especially the song "Give it Up." This song has a lively beat that will get your feet tapping. "All My Friends" is the best friendship song I've heard in years. It is a song about the influence friends can have on you. "Bottom of The Barrel" is a song that reminds us that we can overcome any hardship in life and rise. It is a very optimistic song about never giving up. I enjoyed this album very much. This album is to savor and listen to over and over again to pick up every nuance of the lyrics and the voice. Highly recommended. 
Listening to the radio these days means three things: commercials, annoying announcers, and lots of crappy music. Some say it's impossible for radio stations to make everyone happy, but I'd be surprised if they're making anybody happy. Amos Lee isn't the kind of artist you hear on Top 40 radio, at least where I'm from. And that's a shame. Amos Lee has talent. The producers and musicians associated with this project have talent as well. There's no sense of commercialization in this project. In fact, it feels very raw. Low key, earthy, calming, and very good. You'd be hard pressed to find another music experience like it. This is a CD that you will listen to again and again and again, the kind of music that the medium was made for. And here's hoping this is the shape of things to come 
I don't write reviews; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me. Still..."Amos Lee" stands the test of time. How long ago did I buy this CD? I played it to death when I got it. Had to go see Amos when he came to town. Talked my sister into going with me. "You'll like him, he's low key, kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music." Recently popped the CD back into the CD player. It's still soooo good for relaxing, slowing down, chillin'. My daughter surprised me when the music started. She said, "Is this Amos Lee?!! I love this CD." And she's a 13 year old (self-described)orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock: emo. If you haven't gotten this one yet, but you've been thinking about it, stop waiting. It's intellingent, sophisticated, difficult to classify, and won't get old 
It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s "heydays," including the crank-it-up "Gotcha" (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful "Shadows," among others. I was disappointed more from "Blow It Out" wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott. If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this. Certainly worth $.. 
The Ballyhoo collection was the first major effort to really improve and re-master some the Bunnymen's prior recordings. (Since then, there has been a Box Set and the first five albums have been re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks.) As a die hard fan,I would recommend this collecion to the uninitiated as well as the devoted follower. (Also, the Anton Corbin cover shot of the band is worth the increased import price in itself!)  
This import collection is far superior to their other "Songs To Learn And Sing" disc. It reminds me of how much better the Police import "Greatest Hits" is than the "Classics" album. "Ballyhoo" is 18 tracks, and includes songs like "Over The Wall", "The Game", and the cover of "People Are Strange" that the other collection missed. Plus it has "Lips Like Sugar", which I think is one of the best alternative songs of the 80's. If you hesitate to get this because of the price, I bought it used through Amazon for less than half that amount, and in perfect condition. A must for fans of The Cure, Smiths, etc 
Although this release is an import, thus, harder to find at a good price, it's a much better set than the widely available collection "Songs to Learn and Sing". [This c.d. is inexplicably described by Amazon as a "boxed set" which it's not.] With 18 songs vs 11 and great sequencing, this single disc anthology represents an ideal intro to the band or a great set for those who wants a quick fix periodically. For the committed fans, the 4 disc collection Crystal Days is, of course, essential. (update: As of 11/06 a new compilation, "More Songs to Learn and Sing" has been released which is also an excellent purchase as it significantly improves on the older hits collection. 
Echo and the Bunnymen. Better than the Smiths, the Cure, Depeche Mode, REM, etc. although all of those bands are great too. A great rythm section, one of the most inventive guitarists of the era, and arguably the genre's greatest frontman, perhaps one of rock's greatest. "The Killing Moon" is one of the best songs of the 1980s, up there with "Love Will Tear Us Apart" and "Just Like Honey" in the alternative/indie canon. This is a great collection of songs from the band's first five albums. It fails to include "The Puppet" which is on the "Songs to Learn and Sing" compilation, but it adds "Villiers Terrace, All That Jazz, Over the Wall, The Disease, People Are Strange, The Game, Lips Like Sugar," and "Bedbugs and Ballyhoo," making it the superior collection. Buy it 
A great band with an awful name. The material is worth a full 5 stars but we've kinda been there done that with their previous best of collection: Songs to Learn and Sing. Ballyhoo should have been a double CD collection to include missing tracks like Puppet and Ocean Rain, not to mention some of their better remixes like The Cutter. And Nick Hull needn't apologize for comparing them to Coldplay. Chris Martin is a self-admitted fan of Echo, and it definitely shows in Coldplay's second album. (Coldplay's b-side Crests of Waves is lyrically a sequel to Echo's Ocean Rain and stylistically classic Bunneymen). And let's not forget Coldplay's cover of Lips Like Sugar 
I first heard killing moon in the movie Donnie Darko and I investigated a bit and found it and many other great tracks, by a precursor to bands like the flaming lips... Some songs remind me of coldplay. (I mean no insult, i'm a Canadian teenager who knows no better.) Anyway... good compilation to get you hooked before digging deeper. Get it and enjoy.. 
but i liked them all. i went to schoool in san diego in the 1980s, and the local alternative radio station 91X used to play their biggest hit lips like sugar all the time. they played don't stop and bedbugs and ballyhoo as well, which were just as enjoyable in their own way. how great to find all three in one place 
I heard the song "monsters" on a TV show and had to get the CD. Great stuff 
Monsters Are Waiting may be one of the biggest bands to come out of Los Angeles this year. They have been touring heavily on the west coast. They have become regulars at Spaceland, the Troubadour, and Popscene in San Francisco. I recently saw them at Popscene and they totally wowed the audience. This record is an expanded version of a self-released EP from last year. There are three extra songs. This is a great album from a band that I expect to be really big very soon. Monsters Are Waiting are a combination of glamour, new wave, and intelligent pop music. They only have to do more tours of the East Coast and the UK, and let more people find out about them. If this band went to the UK, things would explode. Monsters Are Waiting are a band to get into 
Boy is this band lame or what? The songs are slow, not catchy and she can't even sing. Jon, go back to Eve 6 and make some real quality music again!! EVE 6 ROCKS! 
The music takes a little bit to grow on you, but boy, does it! It's wonderful, charming, romantic, funny--just like the play itself. I loved almost every song and I was really impressed with "Long As I'm Here With You"-- I thought it was an old song written back in the twenties, because it so sounded like one. The cast is absolutely energetic and endearing, and Sutton Foster just *rocks*. Definitely worth the money. 
If you like musicals, you will NOT REGRET purchasing this musical soundtrack. JUST DO IT. It's so great, you will be listening to it forever. I also saw the show at the Kennedy Center in D.C. and it's one of the best I've ever seen. (And I've seen A LOT.) Have Fun 
A sparkling Broadway lead debut from Sutton Foster (run, don't walk to any live performances given by Ms. Sutton) with superb comedic support given by Mark Kudisch and Harriet Harris (who won the Tony Award for this performance 
Although at first the prospect of a stage remake of the 1967 film which starred Julie Andrews as meager Kansas country bumpkin turned outgoing flapper girl and modern Milli Dillmount may sound absurd, in my opinion, the stage version exceeds all expectations and surpasses the film in many ways. This version includes only one song from the original (the catchy title song) however, the music is highly polished, improved and...breathtaking. It indeed must've been a hard job for fresh newcomer to the broadway stage Sutton Foster to take on the famous role created by Andrews all those years ago however, Foster sheds a whole new light onto Millie's bubbly and feisty character as well as keeping in a suitable amount of the Andrews character. Foster's vocals are second to none! There is nothing like a fresh, tuneful and not to mention powerful set of vocal chords. Of course, the re-vitalised score is all 1920's jazz and to me that is what makes it better- the album keeps in touch with the setting and times and the marvelous band makes it a pleasure to listen to- the overture is a treat with blazing brass and tinkling ivorys. Also another highlight is the raunchy and raucous rewrite of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite which is transformed into the murky and brassy "Nuttycracker suite". Foster's best songs being "Not for the life of me" (reprised several times throughout the show annoyingly but pleasuringly) which occurs post to the jazzy beginning title song which has beenleft as it is but also decadently vamped up with harmonies and an AMAZING ensemble who carry it all the way. We think at the beginning of her song that it'll purely be a typical musical theatre ballad, but do ont be decieved- it gets jazzier and jazzier and Foster's voice makes it so pleasurable. Another of Foster's great achievements is the stupendous "Gimme Gimme" which gradually builds to a crescendo and Foster's musical presence (even detectable on cd) and pelty wildness shines through. "Jimmy" is also a great showstoper which is not to be missed and Foster in fact exceeds Andrews portrayal of the 1920's "modern" who finds and seeks love as well as drifting in and out of it. Angela Chrstian's Miss Dorothy is amazing, her concertino style of voice appeals to me and comes across as being fragile but also belty making her numbers such as- "How the other half lives"- stupendous also with Sutton Foster, "Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life"- brilliant and "Im falling in love with someone"- great as it progresses into a soaring romantic ballad quartet. However, it is a shame that she never gets a full song to herself. One of the cd's highlights however is Harriet Harris' portrayal of Mrs Meers- the sinister hotel owner who is behind a chinese slave ring. Beatrice Lilli's portrayal was hard to beat but Harris is fantastic. "They Don't Know" is the best song on the cd with a smoky jazz melody to it. "Muqin"- a fabulously comic chinese rendition of "My Mammy" is also not to be missed and likewise with Harriet Harris, it is a shame that she is not more included in the cd. Sheryl Lee Ralph stuns as nichtclub entertainer and rich vamp Muzzy Van Hossmere and her two songs "Only in New York"- a fabulous blues melody which builds to an amazing crescendo made even better by the band. And also "Long as I'm here with you"- Muzzy's "cabaret-esque" nightclub song. The guys also are brilliant- Gavin Creel as broke playboy Jimmy dazzles in his numbers such as "What do I need with love" and Marc Kudisch also is stupendous as Trevor Graydon. Numbers such as "The Speed Test" and "Forget About the Bou" are great in the way they are recorded with the taps from the dancers included. In conclusion, the cd is an absolute buy and definitely not to be missed......BUT IT 
Very fun musical. Wish I could see it, but this is the next best thing. 
This is wonderful soundtrack. It is different from the film with Julie Andrews but exactly like the Broadway production. The characters are animated and their voices are perfect "broadway" style. I love this soundtrack - it is so uplifting, perfect for a bad mood or a sour day 
This CD is a great purchase! Sutton Foster's vocals are powerful and emotional while maintaining a very fresh and spontaneous attitude. Jeanine Tesori's orchestrations create a beautful atmosphere to the jolly tunes that flatter, but never overuse, their 1920's inspiration. A great recording with memorable songs that will keep you humming 
This their best cd, it rocks every song rules. They bring out the ramones in you 
the huntingtons are the best band around today... and this is their best release! they bring a certain element of songwriting that no other band can duplicate.. they are funny lyrics but they also mean something unlike many other bands. The guitars stick in your head all day and it doesnt even bother you! There should be 20 stars for High School Roc 
It's very rare these days to find artists daring to try something different. As a musician, Advokat seems to have a very special ability in doing away with the word genre yet at the same time inventing his own. However this isn't just about the music. Disparities brings together an urban realism in the midst of big city buildings and sprawling landscapes. Words don't do it justice, it is a feeling. Like walking through the streets of London on a rainy day. By all means you should be down, but there is such a comfort and sense of belonging in the air that you magically acquire a careering sense of energy and a big smile suddenly appears on your face. You just know. Great release. Great artwork too 
I first heard the song 'Intermation' played in a bar near my hometown, and I just had to get the CD. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere this music creates is just incredible! The artist obviously has great vision, and is able to create a unique 'space' with each track. All in all, an excellent release that deserves more exposure 
One of the premier songwriters who always delivers a tormented musical portrait is Greg Dulli, one-time leader of the criminally overlooked Afghan Whigs and current chief of The Twilight Singers. It's a wry album title for someone who's long battled a nose candy addiction, but Greg Dulli never ceases to turn in a staggering performance on record. Even 2004's covers album She Loves You - in hindsight an obvious stopgap while Dulli attempted to break free of drug addiction and rediscover his lyrical fire - offered an amazing retelling of divergent tracks made famous by everyone from Billie Holliday to Bjork. My Time Has Come is The Twilight Singers' take on Sympathy For The Devil, exhibiting the danger of The Rolling Stones of the late `60s. The song conjures visuals of Dulli walking hand in hand with the Prince Of Darkness as the songwriter documents his own demise. Where once Dulli found himself backed by soul singers and crooning his way through albums, Powder Burns finds the frontman relying more heavily on his alternative tattered style of vocal delivery. Fellow gnarled drug survivor Mark Lanegan again pops up on a Twilight Singers release, albeit in sampled form on Candy Cane Crawl, while Dulli's interest in Beatles (having previously worked on the Fab Four biopic Backbeat and performing John Lennon's Real Love) also rears its head on Forty Dollars, where he reprises their early smash She Loves You. Recorded in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Dulli still proves to be a rogue wave in a sea of listless rock performers 
There are people out there listening to the radio. They want to be rescued. Long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la, there are some that would argue that Y2K was really the day the music died. (If not even sooner, but those folks didn't like Nirvana, Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. Go figure.) Well, anyone who's heard "Gentlemen" or "Congregation" or any other record by the Afghan Whigs should be yelling "Rescue me, Dulli!" And on "Powder Burns," Greg's delivered the goods. Possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the Whigs' "Black Love," the new Twilight Singers record still shouldn't be construed as an Afghan Whigs album without the name. Despite Dulli wearing lead singer shoes, which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated, tunelessly-endearing sound, the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the Whigs. Sure, it's dirty, dirty, grungy blues-rock, but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there. "Bonnie Brae" is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze. Piano and violin pepper tracks like "There's Been An Accident," while rushing, watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there, most obviously on the intro piece "Toward the Waves"/"I'm Ready." Of course to think ahead, people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place. Dulli liked smashing Beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he's taken to purloining lyrics, too, reframing the timeless refrain of "She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah" with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din ("Forty Dollars"). Not every word on "Powder Burns" is an homage, however. Lyrically, Dulli has always struck me as a singing Charles Bukowski. Sometimes it's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you're too bleary-eyed to read 
Greg Dulli is the master of lustful, dreamy and dark rock and his new Twilight Singers endeavor, Powder Burns is a fervent roller-coaster ride. Opening with an industrial thrill, this collection of songs drips in an icy, cool and seductive vibe. Always keen on employing talented collaborators, Dulli includes exciting guest work from Joseph Arthur and Ani Difranco among others. Tinted with a graceful layer of hope and a great bit of that expected sophistication, Powder Burns smokes through haunting ballads and turbulent, bittersweet rock numbers with unshakable vigor. Standout Tracks: "There's Been An Accident", "Dead To Rights" -Antonia Santangelo 
I've been a huge fan of the Whigs/Singers for a long time, ever since their days of playing Bogart's in Mount Adams. The ensenble represented on Powder Burn really hits their stride in a very tight, very complete musical composition. I'll admit after the first two Twilight Singers albums came out, I was pleased with the sound, but it wasn't all there. The next slew of albums had poor production quality and didn't appease me. This album re-affirms Dulli's commitment to putting out a solid product. If you're a fan, this needs to be in your collection. If you're new to this sound, put this on the short list along with Gentlemen and Twilight as Played By The Twilight Singers 
This rocks. Best album he's had since Black love. Amber Headlights was a good indicator, but this is the finished article 
What a great album, considering the circumstances. Greg sounds as inspired as he did back in the Wig's area. Dulli really lets it loose. Great album 
Best ode to New Orleans I've heard so far. I miss it. we all miss it. especilally those who disappeared with it. There is a lot to this record. Listen and G. D. keep it up S 
Dark?!?!?! The recording of this album was interrupted by one of the worst catastrophes to occur in the US! A place the singer calls home. Do you think he was daydreaming about 5 foot waves, beach fires, Abercrombie and Fitch swimsuits and whistlin Beach Boy songs as he witnessed rotting corpses and his town in shambles upon his return? Do your research before your next impulse purchase. The TS cont to be one of the most underrated bands of our day and Powder Burns is another Strong recording. I love Dulli's return to rock on this album. The only reason I gave it 4/5 was b/c I thought Blackberry Belle was a little stronger. This could change after a few more listens to Powder Burns. And the live shows are where it's at. I see that Lanegan will be catching up with the tour soon and DiFranco will be joining in NOLA. Don't miss! Get there early for the openers. 
If Dennis O'Leary is a friend of theirs (after promoting this CD on Comedy Central) he should send them some new guitar strings so the band members can garrote themselves. Talk about a bunch of "songs from the darkside"...Jeez, all I can say is if you want to be depressed, go ahead and buy this. 
I have goosebumps. Honestly. Soul and rock return. I couldn't be happier. "I'm ready" will make you want to jump up in your cube and throw your head about.. Reminiscient of 1965 (Afghan Whigs(AW)). "There's been an accident".. sounds of early Twilight Singers (TS), more mellow. "Bonnie Brae", more Afghan feel, like songs found on Gentleman (AW)... "Forty Dollars", that lovely dirty sound that makes you want your lover... I could go on and on.. Just buy with this, you won't be disappointed... Essential if you are a AW/TS fan 
The music sounds like generic oldschool Eurobeats which is fine. But the vocals are terrible. He sounds like the biggest fag in the world. They're even worse than Eiffel 65 
Hi!!! I'm writing from Greece and I would like to tell everybody about the album "made in Sweden" that is a super album with great hits that will never be forgotten 
If you are looking for some origanal euro-dance/techno music, this is a must have album. I bought this album in 1996 and it has been one of favorites ever since. Unfortunately, E Type has not been able to repeat his debut success in his next albums, releasing only a few hit singles that are worth listening to. I like every song on "Made in Sweden" with the exception of "Me No Want Myseria". Highly recommend to eurodance fans 
This album is very good, and a lot of songs are very original (it's quite rarely in commercial-dance-music), like the famous 'Russian Lullaby', or 'When Religion comes to Town'. The other CDs of E-Type aren't imported in France, and the band has been forgotten. I will have to go to Germany to buy the second one 
This is kind of an embarassment to Jay Ferguson. Why? It is a total sell out to just make money. Jay was in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne. These were cool groups. He is far from cool on this album (what a fruity looking picture on the cover. Nice hair do Jay!). Setting that aside, Thunder Island was big in its time and totally reminiscent of the early 80's. Babylon is a re working of a far grittier Jo Jo Gunne tune. SOulin is ok This is trying to cash in on the Jimmy Buffet vibe. But Jay was a legit rocker so it is hard to take seriously. Its like if Richie Blackmore sang in a barbershop quartet or Keith Moon sang Brill Building songs. It is unnatural but definetly a guilty pleasure. Going from Run, run, run to Thunder Island...please 
Finally Jay or his record company is releasing his solo projects. Unlike Randy California's blistering solo album Kapt. Kopter, Jay has stayed on the mello side {not taking anything away from the late great Randy, because I love his work also}, but it's nice to get mello every once in awhile. The guitar work of Joe Walsh is is unquestionable some of his best, along with the work on the soon to be released All Alone in the End Zone. My good friend Leigh Crutchfield who has had the chance to meet and interview Jay, says All Alone was by Jay's on admission his best solo prodject. Cudos to both the albums and it's about time they were released 
I'm so glad to finally get this cd after being out of print for so long.THUNDER ISLAND is definately the best song on this cd,but there are several other good tunes to be heard on this cd such as LOVE IS COLD. Joe Walsh plays lead guitar on this album and does a great job. Ferguson lays down a very smooth style of an upbeat mixture of keyboard and electric guitar oriented rock and roll. I think this is Jay Ferguson second best cd behind 1979's REAL LIFE AIN'T THIS WAY 
If I could give this record 10 stars, I would do it on sound textures alone. Have thousands of records; have heard it all (go on ask me..oh yea I love that Diesel album too; love most of it, especially the '70s stuff: the Eagles and "Street Survivors," but if you put a gun to my head this album would be on my shortest list- maybe top three. It's what music is all about: escape, love, fun, heart, quirky melody, musical freedom. This guy not only played in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne, but also jammed in the Joe Walsh circle, showing up on one of my other favs, "But Seriously Folks" on keys. He is a Beatle in California clothing. The whimsical pop/rock weekend ditty right off of '70s Block Iland, a total fantasy where the nuts are one mile off the mainland with no shortage of beer, wine and tents, playing in a sort of musical vollyball sand. Hearing Thunder Island in sunny August will spell you like a California surfer hearing his first Beach Boys' song. The title cut opens with a Joe Walsh slide setting the tone. "Night Shift," "Happy Too" and "Magic Moment" are my other loves. If your looking for that jem, the diamond in the ruff, no doubt if you haven't got a copy of this, don't ever think twice. IT will change your life 
This nice miniboxset is a must for all you Weller fans and contains some bsides that are better than alot of his album tracks. Tracks like Fly on the wall- everything has a price to pay- a year late- the portishead remix of wildwood- and Heres a new thing are quality tunes that most artists would kill for. The covers album is solid but not great but the abundance of experimental tracks and remix material shows Weller isnt the "safe" musician some critics claim he is. Theres some acid jazz-techno- alittle triphop and ambient scattered on a few songs-something that he doesnt get credit for. The lower price makes this a good buy and a tidy way to collect all those expensive ebay oop singles. For the new or casual fan this may not be essential but you could do no harm by picking this up 
I was a huge fan of the jam , but Ive grown to despise Paul Weller and this CD strengthens my view. This is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.With paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations ,rarities, box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].This album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto 
Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with "I want Candy" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love "TV Savage", "Golly Golly Go Buddy!" and "Louis Qatorze", along with Annabella's Solo Turn "Fever"....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD "Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as "Sexy Effiel Tower" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and "Radio G String", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD.... 
...and not a "rip off" thereof. Adam "Ant" left the band...the band (Adam and the Ants) and their manager found a new singer, and a new direction, in Myant Myant Aye...er, Anabella Lwin. Just wanted to clear that "rip off/stolen" thing up...and add that I listen to this record often...C30,C60,C90 Go!...relevant for our times, even tho a lot of people don't know what a C30/60/90 even is anymore : 
...I must say it's nice to come back to after hearing the dreck that's out nowadays. The drums &amp; bass on this CD are far above what you hear these days. The bass player is very funky in a non-overkill-slapping way (e.g. Flea). He's sort of a cross between Rocco Prestia (Tower of Power) with a little bit of Mark King (another Brit, from Level 42) thrown in. Very rhythmic stuff and more power to them in pulling it off in a post-punk/new-wave pop era &amp; style. One thing the CD lacks is the naughty song "Sexy Eiffel Tower" which is sort of the 80's version of a Donna Summer album (a lot of heavy breathing). But overall this is an excellent CD for the money for an underrated and hard-to-find band 
ANNABELLA AND THE GROUP BOW WOW WOW--ONE OF THE BEST IN THE PUNK ROCK SCENE OF THE 80'S..A CD EVERYONE SHOULD OWN..I WANT CANDY--BABY OH NO!--DO YOU WANNA HOLD ME--22 HITS IN ALL,A MUST FOR ANY OF THIS GREAT ROCK BAND OF THE 80'S. 
Being a loyal lover of Annabella Lwin and Bow wow wow, I can attest that this album is a must have! Anyone who has only heard MTV's "I want candy" should play this album and really learn what a great band these guys were! At least half the songs here are great and will get your primal juices flowing! My favorite is "Where's my snake. 
Most of the songs are great; I didn't know I knew them, but when I heard them, they were amazing. A couple left something to be desired, however. Overall, though, it was a great CD 
If only the rating system could exceed 5 stars! This album has proved to be quite possibly the best-spent 15.00 of my life. I bought it back in 2005, having been a goo fan for years but never buying any albums. Many of the reviews on here rave about the obvious mega-hits on the album: slide, iris, black balloon, broadway, and dizzy. Don't get me wrong- these are amazing songs too! But I know that as an avid review reader, I like a breakdown of every song on an album, and not just the singles. Dizzy - - One of my favorite songs on the album. Among my friends and I, it's called the "bi-polar" song, because the chorus is so different from the rest of the song. Fast-paced and full of emotion, the melody is great and the overall song as a whole just has a great feel to it. 4.5/5 Slide - - Oh, the famous Slide. This song has become almost a staple in 90's pop/rock/alternative. The tune is catchy enough to reside in your head all day, but there's something about it I feel I can relate to on a deeper level. Something about how upbeat the music is in contrast with the sad theme of the lyrics. Timeless song. 5/5 Broadway - - What I like best about the Goo Goo Dolls is that they produce material that everyone can identify with. The lyrics are crafted from situations that we've all experienced, to some extent. I remember reading somewhere that John Rzeznik wrote this about his alcoholic father. Whatever the meaning, this is a great, solid song with a fun chorus. 4/5 January Friend - - First song by bassist/singer Robby Takac. I'm not the biggest fan of his voice; i prefer Rzeznik's. But Robby's lyrics have a different style to them, and I have to respect it. The song is a little harder to interpret, but overall great to just let loose to. Robby has this energy to him, it's pretty infectious. Not a bad song. 3/5 Black Balloon - - What a difference in style. This song is nothing like January Friend, but somehow the transition is fine. Probably my favorite song, black balloon illustrates a story of love complicated by drug abuse and a girl who Johnny Rzeznik just can't seem to reach. This song is so deep and beautiful, and Rzeznik really shines both lyrically and vocally. 5/5 Bullet Proof - - Not a song that initally popped out at me, to be honest. But after listening to this album for nearly two years, you develop a respect for all the tracks. The guitar is great! Rzeznik's voice seems a little strained, but it actually adds to the fast-paced, almost depserate attitude of the song. Very good. 3/5 Amigone - - Robby Takac's second song. Named after a Buffalo funeral home. I don't care much for this song, but it's not one that I skip over very often, either. Robby's voice again has that infectious, upbeat attitude. Lyrics seem a little repetitive, but not annoyingly so. Okay. 2.7/5 All Eyes On Me - - This song is one of two that, I believe, deserve more recognition. Many albums today are a collection of one to three singles, and the rest of the songs are "fillers", or so-so attempts that all sound the same. This is certainly not true with Dizzy Up the Girl, and All Eyes On Me is not a filler in the least! The chorus has this incredibly real chorus. You can feel the emotion in Rzeznik's voice. What an amazing track; I'd give it 10/5 if I could (: 5/5 Full Forever - - The third Robby Takac song. Despite a mild beginning, the song picks up tempo around the one minute mark, and becomes very catchy! The chorus is backed with great guitars and Robby's raspy voice adds to the diamond-in-the-rough feel of this song. 4/5 Acoustic #3 - - The album's shortest song times in at 1:56. I've seen many a review that complains about the length, and personally I think that adding any more to the song would ruin it. It's short and meaningful, with a simple acoustic guitar and violin in the background. Beautiful message, beautiful melody. 5/5 Iris - - Here it is, the song that everyone in America was singing when the movie City of Angels premiered. It's become less of a song and more of an anthem to every misunderstood person experiencing love. The lyrics are overquoted, but it does not make this any less of a song. I want this played at my wedding. Incredible track. 5/5 Extra Pale - - I find this a rather strange song to follow Iris, and I don't really care for it. Musically, it's a good song. Takac's vocals are strong and I really enjoy the drumline. I do like the lyrics, but I just don't care much for the song. 2/5 Hate This Place - - What a great way to seal the album. This is my second favorite under-represented song. "Hold on, dream away/You're my sweet charade." The chorus is so beautiful and strong. Really defied my expectations. 5/5 In summary, if you haven't yet purchased this album, get in your car and head to your nearest walmart/target/FYE. Or scroll up and add it to your Amazon Cart. You won't be dissapointed. 
I have to admit, I am very sceptical of some music and when I first heard of the Goo Goo Dolls I thought what a sissy name and laughed. Wow was I wrong for thinking that. I love the Goo Goo Dolls and their music. Dizzy Up The Girl is my favorite GGD Cd. My 3 favorite songs are Dizzy Up The Girl, what a great fast paced song that keeps you moving through the whole song, Slide and Iris, which is my favorite song on the whole Cd. Very mellow track and it is very relaxing. Give this Cd a try and you will not be dissapointed 
These guys are the worst. I wish they would crawl in a hole never come out. One of the worst bands of our era 
The Goo Goo Dolls finally released their breakthrough record: DIZZY UP THE GIRL in the fall of 1998. After struggling with writer's block, Johnny Rzeznik had been given a God-send with an oppurtunity to write a single for the film soundtrack: City of Angels. This event was what Rzeznik needed to get his writing flowing again, and his end product was phenomanal. For the band's first Mainstream record, their sound had taken on a significant change. The Goo Goo Dolls were far more pop oriented with a much lighter rock style than they had been performing on their first five records. The players had matured as musicians and were searching for a higher form of music with a lot more identifiable melody and harmony progressions. Rzeznik had taken a huge focous on his accoustic and clear tone guitar playing. His new skills were what had brought the Goo Goo Dolls their public stardom. The public responded dramaticlly to Rzeznik's guitar ballads and wanted more. Not all of the Goo Goo Dolls' originality is lost on this record. There are tracks where the band performs a heavier rock style than their most acclaimed singles. Robby Takac works to keep the band's original sound alive with his performances. Except, his end product are not what most of the public responded to. Its clear why; Takac's pieces are just not as well put together as Rzezniks and tend to be just "mindless rock." These pieces are what decreases the album's quality as a whole. Rzeznik's songs are what finally makes the Goo Goo Dolls stand out in their genre, where Takac's songs are just typical sounds to the rock scene. DIZZY UP THE GIRL is a great record for its aspect in being able to see the Goo Goo Dolls evolve into what they are now, and definately a must have. Stand out tracks include: "Dizzy" "Slide" "Broadway" "Black Balloon" "Iris 
Buffalo, New York band Goo Goo Dolls scored big with 1998's platinum selling album Dizzy Up The Girl. After all, the album featured their biggest selling Number 1 hit single to date Iris, a song made famous for its inclusion in the best selling soundtrack for the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan fiasco City Of Angels (the sountrack also featured songs by U2, Eric Clapton, and Alanis Morissette to name a few). Iris is not the only big hit on Dizzy. The album includes some of the best songs for the New England trio: the elusive hit singles Black Balloon, Broadway, and the hard rocking Slide, the Def Leppard inspired album opener Dizzy, the mellow Acoustic # 3, and the sharp Bullet Proof. Dizzy Up The Girl is the most successful album the Goo Goo Dolls have released so far. It is also one of the biggest rock albums of the past 10 years. Recommended B 
This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!! This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again 
I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene. I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store. Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days. Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now. It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco. It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this. 
Like a lot of people (possibly) I got this C.D. especially because of Iris, which was an amazing song I had orginally heard off of City of Angels. I absolutely fell in love with Johnny's vocals. I asked for this C.D for christmas and when I didn't get it, I went out and bought it anyway. I am so glad I did. Here's a break down by song: Dizzy 4/5: An excellent way to stat off the album with rocking guitars, a softer chorus, and unbelievable vocals Slide 5/5- This is personally one of my favorites on this album. It has great lyrics and it creates a perfect feel to it. Broadway 4/5- The greatest thing about this song is the lyrics which are really meaningful and convey a great message. But not one of my particular favorites January Friend: 4/5 One of the better Robby vocals, but personally I perfer Johnny's style. But it's an overall nice song Black Ballon 6/5: For me this one is off the scale!!! I LOVE this song. The vocals are the best on the album and I love the lyrics. I definetly recommend it Bullet Proof: 4/5 A very good song I esp. love the pre-chorus and the chorus. Great vocals. Amigone: 3.5/5: Another Robby song, still among the strong ones for him... but I really don't enjoy the lyrics on this one that much All Eyes On Me 5/5: The minimalist approach really works out for this simple yet brilliant song. For this songs it's not so much about the vocals, but the brilliantly crafted lyrics. Very good. Full Forever 2/5: I usually skip this song. Advice to the Goos: Robby's a good singer, true, but it's Johnny who has the really unique and appealing voice. Plus the lyrics aren't that good Acoustic #3 4/5: Soft, short, sweet, totally complete Iris 5/5: Probably one of the Goos most popular songs. For a good reason obviously. This song is so full of passion, Johnny's amazing pipes, and of course the guitar solo! The reason I got into the Goo Goo Dolls in the first place Extra Pale 2/5: the problem with this song is it's so forgetable! I've listened to this C.D so many time but it took me so long to remember this song. And then I remembered that I didn't like it. Oh well Hate This Place 4/5: This is an amazing song. A good way to end an overall amazing C.D I DEFINETLY recommend this C.D. It's probably one of my favorite C.D's in my collection. Excepting Full Forever and Extra Pale this C.D is off the hook. It's a must have for anyone who likes the softer sidfe of roc 
is because for the life of me, I cannot understand why the band collectively lets the other guy sing. Johnny's voice is the voice of the Goo Goo Dolls, his songs, his lyrics are what work, what sounds beautiful, and all his songs deserve 5 stars. They comprise about 3/4 the CD, therefore, the other songs that the other guy sings, which are all terrible compositions that just insult the sweet sound of the other songs don't fit on this CD, with this band, I'm perplexed. I don't get how they have this amazing CD, that is going on like one of the all-time classics, and then they interrupt it with his high school band-like crud that sounds worse than filler, it's just foolish souding. I think that they're old time friends, and that Johnny probable allows it because that's how the band keeps it's peace, but dang man, I think they should go. Just take the other songs and you have a 5 star CD. 
It's a good CD, but most of the songs were very very short, as if they didnt really put much effort into it. The quality is good though. 
This further demonstrates Ben Gibbard's excellence as a songwriter. The four songs shared by Gibbard on this EP showcase a more direct, warm, comfortable, yet tranquil artist that resonates in the classics "You Remind Me of Home" and "Carolina", two tracks that stand right up there with his work with Death Cab and the Postal Service. "Farmer Chords" aches in its own Gibbard-like fashion, just as the cover of Andrew Kenney of the band American Analog Set's "Choir Vandals" is of worth. However, the EP does alot the next four tracks to Andrew Kenney, whose songs are just as good in their own way, especially "Hometown Fantasy"...well, they're all great, especially if your an American Analog Set fan...which you should! I give this EP only 4 stars because it is great no doubt, a definite pick for Death Cab and AmAnSet fans alike, but the fact that Ben Gibbard works so well as an artist in this mold, I just wish the whole EP was his 
I'll have to second the opinion that it is the Kenny material that shines brightest on this disk. If it were a whole disk of his material I'd probably give this 5 stars 
This being an EP one really can't expect too much, but then again every now and then some bands put out their best work on EPs. I wouldn't say this EP is the best of either of Ben Gibbard or Andrew Kenny's work, but its not far from it. Starting off with the more upbeat Gibbard this EP starts of with a faster tempo. The songs Gibbard lays out are in his classic style, upbeat, melodic, and good. As i said I don't think it is his best work, but it is definitely good. Next comes Andrew Kenny. American Analog Set, or AmAnSet as the hipsters call them, is amongst my favorite bands. One of the major reasons for this is due to Kenny's soothing, soft, and able voice. He does not let me down by any means. For those of you who already listen to American Analog Set, this is a similar style music, but accoustic, so that means no xylophone, drums, or any of that complication. I'm going to have to disagree with many people and say that Andrew Kenny is the star of this E.P. And I'm not going to say he is the better artist, but purely because I believe the standout song on this CD is Kenny singing "Secrets of the Heart." Gibbard and Kenny are both in some of the best bands currently together, and it is somewhat refreshing hearing both of them doing their own thing. This EP is a great buy for either Death Cab for Cutie, Postal Service, etc. or American Analog Set fans. Their is nothing you should be unfamiliar with that these frontmen sing, but it is different just hearing them and their guitars 
Yes, we all know he showed his acoustic ability with All Time Quarterback a few years ago, and yeah, it was all right. The CD that was reissued by Barsuk proved that Gibbard can hold his own by himself. What this split proves is that the major songwriting force behind Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service is capable of great things with just an acoustic guitar and a simple chord progression. His songs (all 3 originals) are vibrant and full of life and emotion. "You Remind Me Of Home" could very well be Post Parlo's theme for the HOME series. It's a vivid ride through suburbia pointing out the summits and valleys of a small town. The song is double tracked vocally which gives it that extra kick that even further showcases Gibbard's strength and presence as a vocalist (a 'flaw' that has been pointed out by nay-sayers). "Carolina" is simply marvelous. "Farmer Chords" is an amazing piece of songwriting that is as happy as it is listless. The song begs you to hum along, and you will. Gibbard's cover of Kenny's "Choir Vandals" is superb. Though some reviewers bash Andrew Kenny's soft-spoken, quiet tunes, they have some redeeming qualities. If you are not a fan of American Analong Set or you have never heard them before, this is no place to start. If that is the case get "Promise Of Love", I assure you, you will enjoy it more than these three songs. Although "Secrets Of The Heart" and "Church Mouse" are not Kenny's best material, he is in top form on "Hometown Fantasy" which is equally fitting as a mission statement for the HOME series, in a much more somber way. Kenny delivers an honest, straightforward composition with a simple refrain that is as hum-able as "Farmer Chords". Kenny's cover of Gibbard's "Line Of Best Fit" is excellent. He does little to alter the chord progression or shape of the song, but he ultimately pulls it off better than most anyone could have (save, perhaps Gibbard himself) on an unaccompanioned acoustic guitar. Yes, I would agree that there is nothing technically amazing on these eight songs, but, if you want technicality, go listen to Rush. You aren't considering purchasing an acoustic Ben Gibbard/Andrew Kenny split for its technicality, you want it because it showcases both songwriters (particularly Gibbard) and proves that the best songwriters can create great songs with just a melody and a six string. A MUST for any real Death Cab or AmAnSet fan. Buy the Bright Eyes/Britt Daniel HOME split as well. Support Post Parlo, they are a great little label. 
This CD blends indie and folk together very nicely. I myself prefer the first half of it because I am more of a Death Cab fan. However, Andrew Kenny does his part well and even pulls off a cover of DCFC's "Line Of Best Fit." Although there's nothing mindblowingly original or complex here, this is very pleasant sounding music. The tunes are simple, sweet and gently rolling. A good addition to fans of either band 
I found this album a pleasure to listen to. It was a good idea for Ben Gibbard to team up with Andrew Kenny, as the two have similar singing styles. That is not to say that either's songs replicated the other's. The first half of the album, featuring Gibbard, is more upbeat; although the lyrics express a longing for home, the melodies are hopeful. It is hard not to sing along to "Farmer Chords," which is my favorite of Gibbard's four. Kenny's songs are of a different quality. Whereas Gibbard's guitar seems clunkingly friendly, Kenny's is often subdued, as in "Hometown Fantasy," where it plays lightly in the background--it is barely noticeable yet the song would be nothing without it. Kenny sings more softly and you may have to strain a bit to hear the words. His voice, though quiet, is powerful; it gives the songs a different emotion from that of Gibbard's. The same idea of home, which through Gibbard's songs seemed hopeful and like a fond memory, holds sadness, too, by the time the second half of the CD is through. All the songs are vocals with acoustic guitar, which adds to the album's homey feel. I loved this CD despite its short length. Good for when you're feeling a bit sad or lonesome 
This is honestly one of the best CD's I have ever purchased.... Every song is different in it's own way. My favorite songs are February, and Streetcar. I'm gonna keep it simple... GO BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW! ATFEH is KIND OF like The Early November, with screaming. They sound alittle like Before Yesterday, but much better in my opinion. So...um..what are ya waitin' for? 
After hearing the 30-second sample of "February," I immediately went and downloaded all the songs from this album. But then, I ordered a copy from Amazon because I felt that A Thorn For Every Heart certainly deserved my $10 for this excellent album. On this album, the band sets themselves apart from the typical screamo pack, a scene that's not exactly brimming with talent or originality. They are very adept at blending emo, post-hardcore and even a smattering of thrash. To me, they sound up the alley of Armor for Sleep and Thursday (both of whom I love). There's not much punk influence here, which I think is a good thing -- the lyrics are more mature and thoughtful than pop-punk, and as far as I can tell there are no references to high school. The songs also have tempo changes, which is not seen often enough in screamo, but is welcome here. What drew me in so strongly to "February" (which is the best song on the album and is simply brilliant) was the dual-vocal harmony in the chorus -- it's just amazing. Writing one set of lyrics with melody is hard enough, but these guys can double it up with great results, which shows how skilled they are as songwriters despite their young age. This song is so full of energy and genuine emotion (without screaming!), it's practically impossible for me to not hit "back" on my CD player and hear it again -- it's that good. "99 With An Anchor" is a fantastic opener, really setting the tone for the rest of the album. Usually singing/screaming combos in this genre get a little grating, but in this case it works like a charm. My favorite part of the song is when the boys sing, "We all have, we all have someone..." The melody is just awesome. "Streetcar" (with its great lyrics of "After what you did, why should I care?") and the final track (which features some great synth) are also standouts. There is no track on here that I skip, although I agree with the other reviewer that there is too often a single-mindedness in their approach to the songs -- which is apparently to beat the crap out of every track. Hopefully the band will progress and write songs that lull and meander in spots and build anticipation -- something that doesn't happen in any of these songs, which are generally full of full-tilt energy. Although, the energy is certainly infectious. And one reviewer remarked that the production is terrible -- it definitely isn't. The vocals (which sound awesome) were given so much attention that the guitars specifically suffer on the album. The guitars are mixed pretty weakly, which is a shame and a big no-no in my opinion. The guitars rest mostly in the background when they should have been huge in the mix with the gain cranked. The album would've sounded a lot different (and better) with the guitars sharp and chunky, but instead they're just warm and a bit muted. On a side note, the violins used on the album seem out of place and unnecessary -- the four instruments quite nicely stand on their own feet; anything extra is more or less a distraction. And I also wonder why the drummer on this album isn't a regular member in the band (they still don't have a regular drummer) -- he's very talented, and it's a shame they don't keep him around. Revolving drummers in a band doesn't usually help its sound solidify or progress. Despite a few flaws, this album definitely rocks and I would recommend it without hesitation. It's different, and that counts for a lot in my book 
i heard this cD from one of my good friends and loved it right from the start. They are a very talented band and they created something a little more original to be considered there own. I read over alot of the reviews and a lot of them are B@LL $H1T. one person said the recording was bad, well.. its not there fault u DL the cr@ppy versions. Buy the actual cD and it sounds good, just a little quieter, all the more reason to listen to them loudly! and alot of people are saying that they wanna see more slower and lovy duvy songs.. idk about you, but this album intreged me because of the fact that they created something emotional that wasnt your average pu$$y emo. they didn't ruin it with any MTV $H1T. For hard core listeners, this is a good ALBUM to broaden your taste and bring out that inner side of you W/O being a flamming PU$$Y! As for you ATFEH! Keep up the amazing work and please don't go mtv emo pu$$y on us! you have an amazing talent, keep up the exceleant work 
A Thorn For Every Heart was a band that I just recently started listening to. What really blew me away was the originality of their music. Someone in a previous review stated that "if they had put this cd on shuffle, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the songs" or something like that. This is somewhat true. Every single song has a different sound but they do mix different paced beats in EVERY SINGLE song. However, I think this gives them their originality, because they have a sound that is totally different from anyone else in their genre. I would recommend this cd to someone who is an avid emo/rock listener but wants to check out something different. *side-note* Someone else said this before, but you should really take the time to listen to the songs before you go out on a 'whim' and buy it because of the mixed paces 
how could anyone be so stupid as to compare ATFEH to senses fail. senses fail SUCK so bad it's not even funny. SF has no originality, and their music isn't layered in screaming/singing like ATFEH. senses fail and the used = suck. now that we've gotten all that out of the way, heres what I thought of the record... As someone who listens to many different types of rock, it's hard to find anything original anymore. I was turned off by ATFEH at first listen just because of my hatred for bands like Hawthorne heights, but ATFEH is actually totally different. their music is much more emotional, true emotion, not the faux stuff you hear on mtv, and their screaming vocals are placed at all the right moments. they incorporate tempo changes too, which make them comparable to thursday, but also, they have an underOath-esque agression in them that make their songs fly by at an unbelieveable pace. as another reviewer said, ATFEH are an exception in a world of phony "hardcore" acts. I usually don't buy too many records anymore just because of digital downloading being so much easier, but I felt I had to support the band and ordered the record today. it's short, but oh so sweet. long live A Thorn For Every Heart. 
I was very happy with my selection, it was sent in a fast manner, it came wrapped in new condition and I am enjoying the CD. I would highly recommend buying from this vendor!!!!!!!!!! thank you your prompt and courtesy attention to my order 
Anyone who listens to this artist and gives him less than 5 stars must be tone deaf! Frank Sinatra would be proud to know that someone as talented as Michael Buble' is carrying on his music to the next generation of the world. The younger generation of today (myself included) thought Sinatra was for our grandparents, but Buble' has proved us wrong. He always gets my feet tapping and my fingers snapping! Can't wait for his next album and tour. Until then, he'll continue to be the most played on my iPod 
I found myself squealing along with the crowd in the audience of the DVD. Remembering how I felt when I saw Michael at Berkley, CA. I love this DVD + CD set. I now have a sort of memento of the concert that I attended and Michael sounds and looks even better in person. SQUEAL! SQUEAL! SQUEAL! ; 
Who whould have thought that anybody could ever even come close to Sinatra - much less be his equal? Well, Ole Blue Eyes has met his match in Michael Buble. So rarely does a talent of Buble's caliber come along...he is this generation's answer to Sinatra. Now, if we could only entice him to record a duet(s) with Renee Olstead life would be ideal! Michael not only has an amazing voice but he is truly the best performer I've ever seen...what a wicked combination! 'Caught in the Act' is superb and a definite must have 
From the first moment I heard a Michael Buble tune I was hooked. Then I accidentally found the DVD along with the Caught in the Act CD. Amazing!!! I'm so glad DVD's don't wear out 
I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself... Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album "Songs For Suicidal Lovers", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: "...aural film noir...delve into the dark side... 
I only recently became familiar with Buble when I heard him sing as a guest on a Chris Botti album. I saw this DVD/CD available at the local library so I thought I'd check it out. I am very impressed with his abilities as a vocalist. He has a great stage presence and is reminiscent of Frank Sinatra. Some of the arrangements are the original arrangements by the artists who made the songs popular, and Buble does a great job following in their footsteps. Obviously, by the crowd reaction on this DVD, as well as by the fact that his albums are currently on the top of the jazz charts, he has a lot of supportive fans. I must admit, the only somewhat negative comment that I have to say about Buble's singing, that he has a slight lisp at times that is a little annoying. I noticed that it seemed to come and go from song to song, and was more prominent when he sang then when he talked. Besides that, he has a great voice. The band rocked out on here. Another thing I like about Buble is that he is very humble and always acknowledges the band members and their contributions. Michael Buble is on a ride right now towards fame, and he is enjoying every minute of it. He has solidified his position as the new male voice of jazz with this DVD/CD. I look forward to hearing other musical contributions by him. There is one more side note that I'd like to make. This was released as a CD + DVD set. In my opinion, the extra CD really doesn't need to be included. I think he should have just released it as a DVD. The CD is only 30 minutes long, and is not as exciting to listen to as the DVD is to watch. I have become kind of a sucker for music DVD's lately because they are just as compact as CD's yet they have visual as well as audio. I suppose that releasing it as a CD + DVD is a somewhat unique marketing strategy, which could be why it was released as a CD + DVD set 
Since I've been unable to see Mr. Buble perform in person, I was so excited to find this DVD presentation. From the his initial stage entrance to the final song its just fabulous!! His "bubbly" personality shines through each performace and the banter he carries on with the audience is funny/charming/very entertaining. I recommend this wonderful viewing experience to anyone who enjoys a great show with great songs that are timeless 
I have been a fan since the beginning and I LOVE the DVD that came with this CD. I have never seen a performance live, but now I can't wait to see him. He is adorable...and funny...and cute...and smart...and cute...and SOOO talented...and did I mention cute? His voice is wonderful and I actually find myself enjoying many of his versions more than the original standard performers. His music is in quite a few movies and many have heard him and not realized it was a young, fairly new singer, thinking it was one of the oldies instead. If you are a standards fan, you won't be disappointed. 
I bought this CD after buying a DVD called The Wedding Date. Most of the songs performed on this sound track are his, and I fell in love with Sway, and Home. He has a very mellow, dreamy, sound, much reminiscent of Frank Sinatra or more recently Harry Connick Jr. My nineteen yr old daughter is also a fan of his now and in the future. The CD itself is good but, if you purchase this item be sure to get the edition with the concert DVD also, as there are more selections on this, but only 8 to 10 selections on the CD itself. 
If you love to dance, if you love guitar, if you love witnessing (in this case audibly) a master craftsman practicing his craft then you need to own this music. Johnny A, by his own admission, has had a long and tortuous love affair with his guitar; and like any long-term affair where each partner begins to assume characteristics and traits of the other, Johnny A has melded himself with his guitar to the extent that it has become an extension of his body, his soul, his mind. He has become one with his music. This man can flat out play guitar. I can't listen to this CD without dancing...I have to move, it's that evocative. And it is sooooooo smooth and sweet, like ear candy or soul candy. Definitely my favorite CD, still, after a year and a half. If you love good guitar and if you love to move and be moved, this CD is just what you need 
I do not know if people that do not play the guitar understand the value and meaning of tone; but most guitar players lack that one rare ability to achieve the perfect meld of guitar and melody through the right set up WITH originality and verve. Johnny A has been around for along time performing other artists songs, but wow!, he should not have spent so many years as a sideman. This CD will grab you from the first cut with haunting chord progression with that unique custom hollow body sound. You will be hooked right then and there. This CD will take you on a ride of classics,rock-a-billy,swing, blues and downright DIRTY rock and roll, Texas style. This is a must, buy it, give it, and you will never tire of it. If you do not love this CD, then give your stereo away and buy some books....You guitar players, listen and learn how the tone of your guitar and the phrasing you use can be magical. 
Sometimes it's fun to be a fan of an obscure artist, but in this case there is absolutely no joy in it. Both of Johnny A's albums should be far more popular than they are. I like to say that there are really only two kinds of music---Good music and BAD music. Johnny A's music is so damn good, it's truly a crime that more people don't know about it. Just listen to some of the horible dreck that gets played 24-7 on our American airwaves. No wonder we're in such sad shape! Johnny A's music appeals to a wide variety of people. I've given at least ten of his albums to friends and every one of them has thanked me profusely. Too many people are missing out on a delicious, sweetly smokin' guitar instrumental album that can be listened to repeatedly without a hint of boredom. My good friend Kirk from Malibu turned me onto J.A. about two years ago---he truly gave me a gift that I will treasure for the rest of my life. It's really THAT good 
Johnny A. has a cool style. Whatever song he plays he makes it his own. This gives his CD a very cool unified vibe with an edge which is uniquely Johnny A. Goofy photo in the CD liner, though. 
Johnny A is truly a rising star. I saw him live "by accident" and was very happy that I was introduced to his music. He is still relatively unknown, unfortunately. He seems to be quite popular in Boston, where he is originally from, but even here in NJ, I haven't heard his music played on the radio yet. He deserves more than this. There is way too much crappy music around that's polluting our radios which almost makes it a crime not to give this guy the sort of fame he deserves for his work. The fact that you have over 40 reviews of his CD and most of them give 5 stars certainly says something for how solid, original, creative, and high-quality his music is. Truly a work of art. He stands right up there with many guitar greats like SRV, BB King, Albert King, Eric Clapton, and others. However, in contrast to these guys, Johnny's CDs are all instrumentals, and the fact that he is able to capture the sort of attention and admiration that he does with guitar instumental work is both noteworthy and testament to his talent and creativity as both a songwriter and a guitar player. His style is extremely diverse, and I was amazed at how many different tones of sounds he was able to extract from one custom-made Johnny A signature Gibson guitar. I mean, wow. After listening to this CD and his other new CD, try to see him live, and you will not be sorry. Johnny is simply a gem, and I really hope his career flourishes to the sort of fame and wide recognition he deserves 
this guy literally has blown me away...i bought the person who turned me onto him a very old bottle of pinot noir in thanks...you can't go wrong in buying this cd...enough said 
Writing a music/guitar album is very hard. It's very difficult not to make your songs soung like their all the same or just some kind of extended jam session. Not only does Johnny A gives the songs identity he gives them a great jazz/blues feel. I had the fortune of catching him live with B.B. King. It was the first time I heard him play and he was worth the price of addmission. This cd is a great repersentation of his music 
The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because there were a couple remakes of old songs I never liked to begin with - but, that's just me. With that exception, I'll say BUY IT. This CD is refreshing because it's just fabulous guitar music. No lyrics to spoil the pureness of exquisite picking. Johnny A. transitions from blues to jazz to country (even some slide in there) flawlessly. Here's a CD you'll listen to over and over and hum the tunes when you're not listening to it 
I love this CD. I put off buying it for awhile but am so glad I finally got it! I love every song. It's very relaxing on the slow songs, and upbeat fun on the faster songs. He's so talented, and everything he touches turns to gold. Get this CD - it's GREAT 
Every song on this CD is writen masterfuly and with emotion. if you want a tear-jerker, it's on this CD. If you want power-country, or what ever, it's here. It's all in this nice little CD 
I thought that this album wasnt one of Keith's best albums...I like some of the older albums better but maybe we will see more of the "better" albums in the future 
I love this cd. It has such a great mix of songs. What I like most about Keith is that he writes almost all of his songs and he plays the hell out of the guitar. I love the music in this cd. The banjo, the drums, guitars, everything. I saw him in concert a couple of months ago and he sure knows how to play that guitar. I love all these songs with "Better Life", "I Could Fly", "Nobody Drinks Alone" my favorite

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ALBUM, BEYOND COMPARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU, KEITH!!!!! 
LOVE this CD!!! From start to finish... Keith has you enthralled in his musical world. You can't help but get up and dance to "Days Go By." The lyrics ring true... "we talk about forever, but we've only got today." I have been told "forever" by a few men in my life... only to learn that "Days Go By" and "we've only got today." The second song on the CD "Better Life" has a real Aussie flavor. It's an inspirational song encouraging the listener to "dream as big as the sky." "Making Memories of Us" is a perfect song for a wedding. "God's Been Good to Me" is a reminder to be thankful for all that we've been given... even for something as simple as the sun. "Tonight I Wanna Cry" is a song that conveys a man giving in to his tears. He's heartsick about a lost love. The depth and passion that Keith brings to the lyrics can have you in tears. "She's Gotta Be" is a song about a man's regret regarding how he treated his girl. If he could just go back again and "be the man that she could trust, who put her first, who tamed his demons, who healed her hurts, in health and sickness, who helped her grow, with no resentment, true repentance, God as my witness.... yeah, I could be that man she needed me, she needed me to be." Powerful song for any woman who has been treated poorly in a relationship and for any man who has treated a woman poorly. The last song on the CD "These Are The Days" ties in wonderfully with the first song on the CD "Days Go By." "These are the days we will remember... cause days go by." This is an amazing CD!!! I highly recommend this CD to anyone who not only enjoys country music but music in general. Keith's voice has a magical way of allowing the listener to feel the lyrics. In my opinion, Keith Urban is an upcoming SUPERSTAR!!! 
This CD is great! I love every song on it. I haven't taken it out of my CD player in the car since I got it. I would definitely recommend this to any country music fan and especially any Keith Urban fan. 
This is a magnificent CD. Keith Urban is a true country artist whose music appeals to lovers of all genres, a feat in itself. If you don't buy this CD you will be denying yourself the opportunity to hear one of Australia's finest exports 
Keith Urban is doing well as a country singer. However while listening to the songs you tend to get a queer feeling that his previous album "Golden Road" was slightly better. However if you enjoy country music, you're in for a treat. Good lyrics, wonderful rhythm, and good music all lend to that "easy going" kind of a feeling. A pleasurable album a must have 
Yes, yes, i know what you're about to say: OVERKILL!!! ANOTHER Rush compilation??!! It's true, the folks at mercury/universal have flooded the market with compilations in recent years, but let's take a moment to analyze those, shall we? "Chronicles": the first, true, Rush 2 CD compilation, it was released several years ago, when Rush changed labels. Then came "Retrospective I II", which, essentially, consisted of the same songs included in "Chronicles", but split in 2, so people could have the possibility to buy one or the other; althought these compilations offered almost nothing new (there were a couple of different songs, that's all...), it was a smart move, and one that has become increasingly common for record labels in recent years (Atlantic did the same with Zeppelin's "Remasters", spiltting it into "Earlier Days" and "Latter Days"...). Then came the single disc "Spirit of Radio", which was a Greatest Hits of sorts, with little appeal for long time fans, but most likely meant to attract new ones. It failed to represent the band's full body of work, but it probably served well its purpose of enticing new listeners. And now we get the latest installment of the "Gold" series by Universal. But unlike many other such compilations, which (to me) more often than not fall short to people's expectations, this one is pretty good! You get 29 songs (one more than Chronicles) spanning all of their studio albums with mercury, for less than 15 bucks! The song lineup is somewhat different, though, but you get pretty much all of their "big" songs included in Chronicles(Working Man, Flight by Night, Closer to the Heart, Limelight, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, 2112, etc), and I believe that long time fans will appreciate the inclusion of songs like "By-Tor and the Snow Dog" and "Xanadu', which, oddly enough, were left off Chronicles. Of course, if you want to complain, you can always do so by saying that this or that song were excluded, but C'MON, what else can you ask for $15? By restricting the song selections to studio albums, live versions of songs like "What you're doing" and "Passage to Bangkok" are absent here, and while it is a shame, i guess we can all eventually get over that. A few other songs are absent here, such as "A farewell to kings" and "Lakeside Park", and the running order (random, as opposed to chronological) is probably not the best, but in the end, I still think that this compilation is very much worthwhile, especially if you take in consideration its best asset: value. You really get your money's worth and, at half the price of Chronicles, I think this is the best choice right now for those looking for an introduction to the band, and maybe also for those long time fans looking for a good compilation. Let's face it, for a band with such an enormous catalog as Rush, it is almost impossible to please everybody. So there you go, now you know what to expect, so the choice is up to you now, but be sure of one thing: if you choose to get "Gold", it will be a purchase you won't regret. 
An Exelent disc complimation, but this is the same greatest hits pretty much as "Cronicals", "Retrospectives volume one and two" and "Spirt of Radio (which was only one cd but stops at 1987)". I don't know if its the record company or what, but there is nothing out for anything they did after 1987 except for their live albums and the studio albums. This is a very good set of their basic stuff especially for someone who really does not know to much about Rush and wants to learn more about them. If you are a hard core fan however, spend the money and get all their albums. You won't regret it becasue every album they released is different 
The reviewers who have written that these cds sound the same as other Rush hit cds are wrong! I bought this Rush collection and I have compared them with the other Rush hit cds that I own. I have a modern stereo. These are 100% better sounding with more seperation , depth , and balence than all of the others. They are not the same as the 2 Rush Retrospective cds , at all. Mercury has done an excellent job with their gold series cds. Others cds that I own in this great collection that I love are , styx gold and b.t.o. gold. So , if you want 2 Rush hit cds with "blow your mind" sound these are the cds to get! And to all of the others that have written that they are the same , it is their loss. These are the best sounding Rush hit cds and at a great price! Next I hope that they will do their whole career with this kind of sound 
The merits of the music on here has been argued to DEATH!!! If you can't tell how great "Rush" is, you need a hearing aid!!!! let me address the disc: If you have " II", IT'S THE SAME THING, RIGHT DOWN TO THE SONG ORDER!!!!! The only difference is that, on disc 1, "Something for Nothing" was removed as track 3 "Working Man" was tacked on to the end. Disc 2 is THE SAME DISC as Retrospective 1981 - 1987"!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have one, you don't need the other!!!!! 
Although this compilation is great and an updated version of the older classics,the newer music is not here. The contract was up w/Mercury and the band decided to go with Atlantic for their future distribution.This also means that the newer material that is not on the disc is because of the different labels.It's a contract thing..Mercury which has been bought out by Universal has the publishing rights to the bands older songs.So the label can reissue all the best of's as long as they want and the band can't do anything about it.Just business.. Hopefully,in the future the band w/Atlantic will decide to release a hits from '88 on. So for the time being we can just make our own best of downloading MP3's.. 
It's been almost 10 years since the Rush catalogue was remastered. This new double CD (which is redo of the Retrospective CD's with Working Man replacing Something For Nothing) is great. I've compared the CD's these do sound better. There is more definition, depth on these remasters. Alex's Chorus effects seem a little more lush on Red Barchetta other songs. It is subtle but true Rush fans can hear little details like that. This really makes all the other Rush Compilations obsolete. I just wish Warner/Atlantic would do a compilation of the newer material. The Polygram years stop at 1987 
Well... looks like weve got yet another Best of Rush set on our hands. Only this time, its a rehash!! Of the 2 Retrospective cds that came out some years ago. I was acually pleased to find that they replaced Somthing From Nothing with Working Man (Rushes biggest hit of the first album). But i still think the best thing about it is the very low price. Sure this release was put out ofcourse to make money, but 20$ seems to get you an awsome collection and days. All songs are remasterd and almost seems to have the best tracks from the self titled album to Hold Your Fire. What kinda bugs me is that Mercury dosnt seem to stop releasing new best of cds. First was the 1990s Chronicles. It was the 2 disk set that got me into Rush in the first place. Chronicles truly travels album by album in CHRONILOGICAL ORDER. Including theyre live albums. Dont be fooled, if you havnt heard Rush live, your missing out. (Some of theyre live versions are better than theyre original recordings). And it dosnt stop at Hold Your Fire, but at Presto. But, the price is a little steeper, lets say 30$! Gold Rush is only 15 to 20$ Now both of these albums are some bad ass sets. You get songs like La Villa Strangiato, Freewill, Subdivisons, Anthem and my favorite, 2112 Overture/Temples of Syrinx. Now, is Gold better then Chronicles? No Why? Because Chronicles truly does capture the Rush Legacy from the first album to Presto in that order. Amazing classic rock songs like Farewell to Kings, Lakeside Park and live versions of What Your Doing and the fan favorite Passage to Bangkok (better then the original) are missing from Gold. Now, is Chrinicle worth the extra price you pay? No Why? Because 15$ for for this amazing Gold Complication is just ridiculouse, I cant see how any Rush fan or Fan wanting to get into Rush can pass this up. If you got the extra cash, then get Chronicles. Its a better tracklist and the order of the songs is perfect. Gold order kinda irratates me from time to time, but its still amazing music. Its still Rush and at a awsome price. Ofcourse, this isnt THE BEST of Rush. This only covers half the story. They dont cover Roll The Bones to Vapor Trails. All good albums, but youl need another 2 disk set to cover that. Maybe one day. Until then, you can own the first half of the Rush Legacy so go on and enjoy the Limelight! 
The collection stops in 1987 because this is a Mercury/Polygram product. Rush went to Atlantic after A Show of Hands. If you don't own any Rush, this, The Retrospectives I and II, Spirit of Radio or Chronicles are good best of, sort of collections. Rush have bashed Chronicles, but for a while it was the only CD version available of Passage To Bangkok, but I digress. They were involved in the art for SoR, and song selection and art for the Retrospectives. Given that the friendly Rush forum (RIP Trinet) died, I've no idea on this one. As any devout Rush fan would tell you, however, don't you want to buy all the Rush albums? You do, really...start in the era you like and buy a couple...Rush is best experienced by album....What? It's only money for 18ish CDs..... 
While the material on "Gold" is uniformally outstanding, you shouldn't buy it. It's just another example of Mercury Records mining their rights to Rush's first 15 albums for a few more bucks. "Gold" is (with the exception of one switched song) actually a compilation of the 1990's-era "Retrospective" best-ofs, which in turn were a slightly-expanded version of the earlier "Chronicles". Somewhere in between, Mercury also squeezed out "The Spirit Of Radio," a single-CD compilation. All of these various repackagings had one thing in common: the musicians who created the actual music had no say in putting them together. Don't reward the Mercury suits for yet another lame repackaging of old material. If you want to get into Rush, go buy to the actual albums instead (every Rush album is still in print). They'll be worth it 
Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. "Sexuality" is a great disco/funk number. "Do Me, Baby" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. "Private Joy" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for "Annie Christian", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career 
I was a senior in high school when this album came out and I remember it like yesterday. This was before Prince really blew up and began to move away from his r roots in order to gain a bigger audience. Songs such as the orgasmic "Do Me Baby"(who can forget the obvious satisfied sounds of a young lady in the middle of this song),the upbeat "Private Joy", and the funky beat of "Lets Work" show a genius on the verge of superstardom 
Controversy, the follow-up to his masterpiece 'Dirty Mind' functions as a bridge between that album and the techno-heavy '1999'. This is in my opinion his most underrated album. It's enjoyable from start to finish. True not all the tracks are great (Annie Christian for example) but they all have their place on this strange yet very fun album. This album also features two of the greatest songs he's ever written namely 'Do Me Baby' and the title track. For those of you only familiar with these songs from the single versions you are in for a real treat to hear the full uncut versions. This album ranks in my top three favorite Prince albums. Get it 
If you know what my title means (from the cut "Sexuality"), you've heard this album. LOVE the procussion from that tune. Prince's 4th album, released in 1981, was easily the most exciting R album of that year. The mixture of rock and R was revolutionary for the times, but this album was relatively unknown outside of Black teenagers in some cities. It's important to remember that Prince was largely an underground cult artist until 1999 (the album, not the year). Pretty exciting stuff. Musically, he expands upon "Dirty Mind's" formula of Rock and R powered anthems of sex, religion (the use of the Lord's prayer in the title cut caused outrage in many quarters), and social commentary. The content of the songs hass been well commented upon by the other reviewers. Just hear for yourself and think. The original Lp had a bizarre poster of Prince in the shower next to a crucifix, which added to the title of this album living up to it's name 
This was Prince 4h album, and released in 1981. On "Controversy" Prince follows the same path as he did on "Dirty Mind". Sexual explicit lyrics and controvercial subjects, the music is also simular which is a good thing. It's often unfairly credited as a weaker version of "Dirty Mind" but it's ofcourse always difficult to make the critics content with a follow up to a masterpiece, although I don't think this album is worse at all. It got the lyrics, the melodies and the controversy ofcourse. First song, the title track is a reply to all critics, on this song he'll mention alot of controversial subjects, almost like philosophy. "Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? Some people wanna die so they can be free" And "People call me rude, I wish we were all nude, I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules". One of the best songs of this album, let me tell you that it is extremly catchy as well. "Sexuality", Prince dream of a new world order, without money, without race, Without segregation. "Sexuality" is all we need. The song is a funky psychedelic song. "Do Me Baby" has to be among his most sexy ballads, perhaps one of the sexiest ever. At the end of this almost 8 minute long song, he's making love to a woman while music still plays. "Private Joy" is a personal favorite of mine, it's catchy as hell. "My little secret, my private joy, I could never let another play with my toy", Too bad it wasn't single released, the closing guitar solo is also great. "Ronnie Talk to Russia" is this album's anti war song, it's a very short but intense. Typical for it's time with the tension about USA and Russia. It's a psychedelic number with choirs singing in the back and a funky guitar solo. "Let's Work" is another funky number. The Synthesizers make up this song. "Annie Christian" or Anti-Christ as it's hidden name is a song where Prince almost talks during the whole song, it discusses the Atlanta Child Murders, the Homicide of John Lennon and the homicide attempt of Ronald Reagan. Closer "Jack U Off" is what you think it is about. Another Controvercial song. Overall, Simular to Dirty Mind, but almost equally as good. This 1981 album offers you more catchy melodies and controversial lyrics. Easily put, Prince is on top of his game and this is one not to miss out. 
On each of Prince's albums that I own (except Purple Rain) I can name at LEAST two song I skip past. I promise you will not skip any of the tunes on this album. In my opinion, "Controversy" is second only to Purple Rain. It is a funky, hard album. 
This album is in many ways a companion album to Dirty Mind. Many similar styles are tried out and performed that were on the previous album. However, Prince has gotten more ambitious. Controversy was his longest song to that point, I believe, and was similar to Dirty Mind yet more political. In fact, the whole album is political with Prince shouting off about his own view points which are sometimes surprisingly conservative. Not that they're anything Regan would like, but just conservative for Prince. The ballads are better on this album too. And the song rock harder: Ronnie Talk To Russia features some of Prince's best guitar work. Some say it's a pale retread of Dirty Mind: not so. It's similar, yet Prince finds enough variations on the style to keep things interesting. Must have 
True Prince fans pre-Purple Rain own and love this one - I don't understand the many reviews on this site bagging the CD as "uneven" or "poor" - HELLO?! This was released way back in 1981, post-DIRTY MIND, but pre-1999, before Prince would breakthrough as one of the first artists on MTV (with 1999/Little Red Corvette), but it's on "Controversy" he truly hones his trademark musical style, image, and vision - look at the "cheap" version of the signature purple trenchcoat that would later become glitzy - all the tracks are stripped down and potent blasts of socio-sexual-political electro-funk NO ONE else dared to produce/release at the time - listen to CONTROVERSY (the full version w/ prayer!), SEXUALITY, PRIVATE JOY, JACK U OFF, ANNIE CHRISTIAN, LET'S WORK, and more to know where Prince's head was at during the early 80s - side two (yes, remember LPs) is a bit more experimental and off the mark, but STILL you gotta give it up for the Purple One - hurry up, someone remake PRIVATE JOY today (Gwen? Britney?) and have a #1 hit all over again...and you cannot forgot those like me who bought the original LP when it first came out were treated to a ltd. editon POSTER of PRINCE almost butt-nekkid in the shower with his cross - YOWZAH! 
I had the tape in high school when it first came out and I bought the CD very recently for two songs in particular. The first, the title track, is a classic. The last track "Jack U Off" is a weird and wonderful mix of electro keyboards, New Wave-ish rhythms, a sing-song melody, and incredibly raunchy lyrics. The remainder of the album is for me, forgetable. 
This album is brilliant.... Period... This LP was the very first perchase of my life ( by the way i was like 5 years old when i bought this ingenius piece of work)... Argubally the wierdest track, which is also my fav is "jack u off"... I love this song and i dont even know why... Other classics "do me baby", "controversy" "sexuality"... Prince is the greatest musician of my time, your time, your mums time, even your grandmother (he has been around since like the 60s!!!!!!!!!! J/P) Prince will always be my favourite male artist... 
If is funny how completely opposite my sentiments are from a few of the other reviewers. For me, this is the album where Echo The Bunnymen really hit their stride. Their earlier works, while occasionally brilliant, lacked cohesiveness. For me, this is Ian McCullooch's style really meshes with the rest of the Bunnymen. This is classic E at its best 
Despite production that makes every track sound like it's ready to be included in a John Hughes movie, this is still a great album. Every song is memorable; there is no filler. Lips Like Sugar, Bedbugs and Ballyhoo, and The Game are classic Echo the Bunnymen singles. This was the first album I owned by the band--I bought the cassette in 1987 at age 11--so my opinion is arguably biased. Will Sergeant is one of the genre's best guitarists, and Ian McCulloch is one of my favorite vocalists. While this release isn't as original as Crocodiles or as ethereal as Ocean Rain, it is good enough to rank as the band's third best 
After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers

I am a huge fan of power pop with a little twang. I strongly recommend that you check out the following: 1) Teenage Symphonies To God by The Velvet Crush 2) Papa Nez: A Loose Salute To The Work Of Michael Nesmith by Various Artists 3) Nashville by Josh Rouse 
A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing; regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend" is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling, which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy, melodic pop-rock 
Matthew Sweet is a brilliant musician always nearly there but not quite. Unlike most fans who prefer his earlier music I am a fan of his later stuff which I find slightly more Poppy and more accessible. He really hits his straps on his slower tunes like "If Time Permits" which sounds like the Thorns to me. Funny that since he`s in the Thorns. Some of his Power Pop riffs are good too but unkind in terms of categorising an artist who shouldn`t be categorised. If you are a fan of `90`s Power Pop or slightly alternative rock or alt. country check out this example of Matthew Sweet. All his good tunes like "Girlfriend, Devil with the Green Eyes" are here from his earlier period. This is the best way to get into his thing 
This was a very pleasant suprise. I often had the idea that the pop/rock of "Matthew Sweet" was something I would like, but it wasn't until I got this cd that I realized how good he is. Of course I knew "Girlfriend" and "Sick of Myself", but after my first listen, I found out that I also knew "I've been Waiting", "Time Capsule", and the awesome "Where you get Love". Plus the songs I hadn't heard, I now enjoy just as much. I'm really glad I got "Time Capsule". It's perfect for the casual fan, and will make your cd collection just that much more "Sweet" 
Ingratiating power pop from a victim of video culture and grunge, the aptly named Matthew Sweet. (Uh, well, aptly named as long as you don't pay attention to the lyrics, the weirdly paired the anthemic chorus and lyrical self-loathing of "Sick of Myself" to start.) Nice lead guitar, especially from Robert Quine ("Girlfriend,""Sick of Myself," "The Ugly Truth"), to go along with the keening vocals. Ace production values. Coulda been a contender 
The Shins are truly unique. It's as if they are visiting us from a slightly parallel universe where whimsy and beauty are more highly prized 
The thing that stands out most in this exceptional album are the lyrical depths that this band manages to reach. Although most tracks are not immediately catching, once you listen to the lyrics it is impossible not to be hooked. I can't compliment this band enough, and anyone who appreciates music should definatly own this album 
These guys are the real deal. Comparing The Shins to The Beatles is not far fetched at all. If Mercer and the gang keep producing albums of this quality, they could easily attain legendary status. However you've managed to stumble upon The Shins, I congratulate you; it's only a matter of time before everyone jumps on the bandwagon. Get "Chutes Too Narrow" asap 
All of the songs on this album are at least pretty good. On some, though, the lyrics are too precious while on others the lyrics are somewhat opaque and the music is not interesting enough to balance the preciousness or make me want to pay close enough attention to cut through the opacity. On some songs, though, everything comes together and the music and lyrics complement eachother perfectly. 'Kissing the Lipless' and 'Young Pilgrims' are excellent but the real highlight is 'Pink Bullets'. Bittersweet! 
...And I couldn't be happier! This album is easily one of my favorite of the past 5 years. I bought it having not ever heard them before (thank you Amazon Recommendations) and was thrilled from beginnig to end. I quickly snapped up Oh Inverted World and did not like it nearly as much. It's a much more somber album than Chutes and I find myself wishing for more "Kissing the Lipless" and "Turn A Square" and less "Caring is Creepy" and "Your Algebra". This time around James' voice is front and center. YAY! I often found myself wishing I could hear him better on their previous release. If you're looking for the best of one of the better up coming bands, snap this up. 
There are those bands that you get addicted to for days at a time, sometimes weeks, if you're really lucky soemtimes months, but when you hear the Shins for tfe first time you wonder if you'll ever anything as good as them again. Chutes Too Narrow, The Shins second major release album, THIRD overall (first was under the name Flake Music, not the Shins), delivers an overall fantastic album and sure you can pinpoint one or two songs and that's how it is with cathcy bands like them but really it's the whole album that does it. It was undeniably difficult to top such a fantastic album as Oh, Inverted World, but they took what they learned about releasing a major album and made each song on this album catchy, meaningful, and somewhat poppy (Sub-Pop is accurate in this sense). Saint Simon is maybe the best song on the album, but no where close to by a longshot. Everysingle song, from Kissing the Lipless to Gone for Good, has it's own unique mood but in the end you get a sense of being a little closer to complete. It's hard to describe what the Shins bring ino words, but that's why they write such great music. The Shins are one of the few basement-recording-indie bands that have made it to big screen pictures and while New Slang is their most famous and best song written that doesn't mean the other's aren't right their with it. It's okay if you understand all their songs, they don't write direct lyrics like most bands. Worth noting, Kissing the Lipless and Turn a Square are two songs that don't recieve enough credit anywhere. Their new album is coming out this year, and if you love great music or anything that makes you understand this is worth buying 
Perhaps the best produced so far? You haven't heard real, un-commercial, awesome, music until you've heard these guys. They are the Mozart of the new millennium. "Of course I was raised to gather courage from those lofty tales so tried and true. 
Great second album from the Shins. This is a bit different than "Inverted World", but I like it evan better. There are so many types of music on this album that it keeps your attention from start to finish. "Young Pilgrims, is my favorite song on this album, it is striped down and raw, but truly great. "Pink Bullets " would be my next best song on this album.This is a very melodic album from start to finish. Although they are an indie band, they are rather slick in production and song writing. I like all the acoustic guitars on this album, something you don't hear that often. I would say this album really rocks without being goofy like so many other bands in this genre. 
This album oozes with talent and originality without being at all pretentious. If it were a vacation, it would be one of those spontaneous, but cool as hell road trips with a few friends. There is not a dull moment on the album and every song, yes EVERY song is very good. There just isn't any filler material on this album. So throw on some shades, take the top down, and enjoy the ride 
This week I went to see Jeff Daniels in concert at the Big Tent Chautauqua south of Bayfield, Wisconsin. The actor, best known for his roles in "Terms of Endearment" and "Dumb Dumber" (although the Jeff Daniel's movies on my shelf would be "The Purple Rose of Cairo," "Gettysburg," and "Gods Generals"), has been writing songs for over thirty years, never professing to be a professional singer-song writer but insisting instead that his songs are his diary. If Jeff Daniels makes a movie where Clint Eastwood blows him away in the end, then he writes a song ("The Dirty Harry Blues"). If he goes out on a first date with the woman who will become his wife, then he writes a song about that too ("Kathy"). You will find that those two examples pretty much encompass the complete spectrum of Daniels' songwriting skills because the first is funny and the second is sweet. As the title clearly indicates, "Live and Unplugged to Benefit the Purple Rose Theatre" was recorded live at the Purple Rose Theater in Chelsea, Michigan in December and January 2003-2004 with all proceeds from the CD going to the theater. Daniels is the founder and executive director of the not-for-profit regional professional theater company and was coaxed into being pushed on stage with his guitar to see if people would be willing to pay to see what would happen next. Daniels initially dismissed the idea as something William Shatner would do (think "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" rather than "Star Trek"), which engendered the song "If William Shatner Can, I Can Too" that starts off this enjoyable album of a dozen songs. The most out of date song is obviously "The Lifelong Tiger Fan Blues," seeing as how Detroit has the best record in baseball this season. Daniels sings about his marriage in "If I Weren't So Stupid, You Wouldn't Be So Smart," and was motivated by his objection to a sign in a bar to come up with "You Can Drink An Ugly Girl Pretty." An encounter with a "State Trooper" engenders a song as well. On the more serious side Daniels has a song about his parents ("Momma Never Left Her Oldest Boy Alone"), his first car ("Blue Valiant"), and a cover of a song about the state in which he lives ("Michigan, My Michigan," the unofficial state song of Michigan, with lyrics written to the tune of "Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum" by Winifred Lee Brent after the Battle of Fredericksburg during the Civil War). The one song that does not really fit into those categories would be "If You're Comin'," an anti-war song written in opposition to "those who wrap their reasons for going to war around a higher power." Vehicle," which makes perfect sense since the true story is clearly inspired by Arlo Guthrie's "Alice's Restaurant." That is one of the songs that have clearly evolved over the years (Daniels updates "If William Shatner Can, I Can Too" nowadays to make a palatable hit on Paris Hilton, admittedly an easy target but a most deserving one as well). Having catalogued his repertoire, Daniels is also able to tell us when and where he wrote each of these songs, and in the back of the booklet makes some brief comments on each of the songs. It really is time for Daniels to cut another CD, because his repertoire is considerably more than the dozen tracks presented here. He only did four of these tracks in his concert ("If William Shatner Can, I Can Too," "The Dirty Harry Blues," "If You're Coming," and "Recreational Vehicle"), and there were easily that many songs that I heard Daniels perform live that I would like to be able to hear again whenever I want. There were several times during the evening's performance that my sides hurt I was laughing so hard, and half of the songs that had us in hysterics are not to be found here. I want those songs, Jeff 
Lots of techno, very upbeat. One of the best for New Order. Almost as good as Brotherhood 
Yes, I like the new albums, "Get Ready" and "Waiting For the Siren's Call" quite a bit, but this classic is still my favorite overall. The opener, "Fine Time" sounds a little out of place and is by no means an indicator of things to come, but it's still an oddly catchy piece in its own right. And some of the lyrics are just hilarious (You know I've met a lot of cool chicks, but I've never met one with all her own teeth). What follows, however, is a string of beautiful, well-crafted masterpieces. Some of them have a more accoustic sound (All The Way, Love Less, Dream Attack) while others are more dance-based (Round and Round, Vanishing Point, Mr. Disco), but they're all excellent songs. The former three would have to be my favorites, though. All in all it's a very short album, about 40 minutes, but it contains no filler. I recommend it to any New Order fan who hasn't already purchased it yet (can't imagine there are many of those) or to people who love good music in general. 
there's really nothing new anyone can say about new order. to say their influence is far-reaching would be an understantment. most people, and understandably so, cite 'blue monday,' 'bizarre love triangle,' '1963,' and 'true faith,' as new order's defining songs (me, i say 'regret' and 'touched by the hand of god' are their best songs). it is, however, a tough argument to reject. however, most of new order's albums as wholes were a tad incosistent and sprinkled in on top of the undeniable brilliance of so many tracks was filler that weighed some albums down. it was with their 1989 release, 'technique,' that new order finally nailed an entire album. new order 'purists' will likely disagree, but such disagreements are usually emotionally-charged and short-sided, and probably due in large part to 'technique's' commercial success. 'technique' begins withs one of new order's finest moments, the brilliant 'technique.' almost devoid of a vocal track, it was a fuzzy, acid-induced, dance-floor stomper. it seems an unlikely first single from the album, but a first single it was and. what's great about 'technique' is that the rest of the album is that it vascillates between vintage new order dance-tronica ('round and round,' 'mr. disco,' 'vanishing point') and more acoustical dance numbers ('all the way,' 'run,' 'loveless'). a few people complain that 'all the way' is a 'just like heaven' clone. it may use the exact same chord pattern, but then again so do several hundred other songs. the comparisons end there and 'all the way' stands on it's own as a brilliant track. 'round and round' is another absolutely classic new order single, every bit as good as 'blue monday' and 'true faith.' the band brought the dance beats to the forefront and let them shine. noticeably muted (and almost invisible) is peter hook's trademark bass. the funny thing is that 'round and round' is such a spectacular song that you barely notice its lack of prominence. 'run,' in my opinion, is the album standout. steven morris'running drum-line (listen closely, the drums are brilliant) and gillian gilbert's synthline serve as a nice counterpoint to peter hook's seductive bass and bernard's plaintive guitar melody. but what makes it special to me is gillian's synths the last minute of the song. it's like listening to a sunset. it's beautiful, terrible cliches aside. what's puzzling about the album is its cover: nowhere do you find the band's name nor the album title. it may be a statement in and of itself: new order *knew* it was a great album, and additing a title or the band name might in some way detract from the album's brilliance. then again, maybe not. knowing new order, it could just have easily been a joke. new order's induction into the rock 'n roll hall of fame can't be far off, and it will most deserved. new order, without question, is perhaps the defining dance band of the era. 
I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad. 
Delicious and constant beats, electronic sections, refinement, class, innovation, New Order have been able to survive Joy Division tragic end years of changes in music punk, new wave, pop, electronic and with electronic all kind of variations even that ones with lack of soul but the true esence of the seed prevals, i love "NO" for a number of reasons, they dare to make a record completelly filled with artificial beats and then record the next one with guitars, bass drums and minimize the use of sintethizers and feeling free of dissapoint one or other audience, this one fits in the first example, Vanishing Point, Round And Round (my fave), fine time, Mr. Disco, you name it! theres absolutelly no waste in Technique, if you wanna know also what is like to listen New Order with more traditional resources check out "Get Ready" you will understand why i respect so much this guys HM 
New Order went through various drug stages as they progressed through their albums and I think if I remember right about the time Technique was being written they were mad dropping the acid. And it turns out acid and New Order works pretty well as on Technique they churn out some great tunes. But whatever night Barney wrote Fine Time, he must of had some BAD acid, because Fine Time is the most awful, wretched, outdate, sucky track New Order ever recorded, prior to Jetstream. This album sounds like summer, and Fine Time is like that one day you decide to go to an Asian kid's party because you're way bored, and it turns out to be mad gay. And Fine Time starts out the cd! I don't know if New Order just wanted to get that track out of the way, or they kept taking that bad acid and kept being convinced that this wasn't the cheesiest thing since that Pet Shop Boys tune about the girls that are from the west, or is it the east side, actually I'm pretty sure it's the southside. Alright, since all my negativity towards the album's first track has been spewed it's pretty much safe to say that the rest of this album is simply phenomenal. This is, I would have to say, Barney's best collective lyric writing, except for Fine Time. I'm not even positive Barney wrote some of these lyrics, I expected some cheesy lines to show up as they always seem to on New Order LP tracks, but no. All the songs are so tight, smooth, and play so well together. Unlike PCL or Low-Life these tracks actually sound like they belong together, as one cohesive unit. This is the cheeriest New Order album period, nothing but positive energy on this one, no self loathing in sight. Barney's guitar and Hooky's bass sound more cohesive instead of the entirely dominating bass that is found in most of New Order's earlier catalogue. This may not be my favorite New Order album, but this is easily the best production of any New Order album. In fact it is still their only album where I can point out that this is some damn good production. Vanishing Point and Round and Round are the high points possessing some great interlayed synth portions. Fine Time sucks, but the rest of this album makes you aware of what it's like when New Order actually really care about such frivolous things as production and theme. This would be New Order's best for a whil 
Technique is the first and only New Order album I have. I'm a big Joy Division fan, so I wanted to hear what became of my beloved Division. To say the least, this is an amusing departure from Joy Division. Sadly, nothing on this CD - to me - stacks up with any of Joy Division's works. To put it crudely, it's like they beat Ian to death with a synthesizer and snorted a lot of anti-depression medication 
I can easily understand why so many New Order fans rate this album as their finest. Coming on the heels of the quintessential Substance, convential wisdom would have suggested that the band had nowhere to go but down. To confound the naysayers, they raised the bar again with Technique, solidifying their sound while exploring a diverse spectrum of sound. Part of the genius is that this album has elements that would appeal to any sort of N.O. fan. You have synth, guitar, and even some goth elements. Each track is strong, and there is no filler. Yes, it whizzes by you very fast, clocking in at just under forty minutes. But, how many times have fans and critics whined about "filler" tracks bloating an album? Here, there is NO filler. In that respect, it's like The Cure's Disintegration, Depeche Mode's Violator, or PSB's Introspective. Don't bristle at the comparisons, please! The overall theme of the album is about flawed love. Sometimes, Bernard Sumner is the victim (Mr. Disco, Vanishing Point), or the villian (Fine Time, Guilty Partner). The first track, Fine Time, throws down the gauntlet. It comes barreling out of the gate, with Bernard's snarling delivery of the lyrics, and a dizzying mix of sounds. How they mashed so many sounds and even a Barry White sample together and produced this song is a testimony to the supremacy of New Order. Now, from pure originality springs a discreet steal from another member of New Wave royalty, The Cure. Yes, the bassline from All the Way sounds almost identical to Just Like Heaven. Yet, I think of this as a happy experiment on how two different yet equally good bands take that bassline and produce two great songs, though Just Like Heaven, of course, takes the cake. Still, not to discredit All the Way- it's one of those new wave songs that will always make your heart smile. The next track, Love Less, also induces positive feelings. It's one of the most beautiful New Wave ballads I have ever heard. Some will call me crazy, but in that respect it reminds me of Erasure's Dreamlike State. Round Round is a song that I always enjoyed listening to on the radio. In my book, it's on equal footing with Bizarre Love Triangle, Blue Monday, and True Faith. And besides, any angst-laden teenager (i.e., me in the early 90's) can identify with the lyrics- "The picture you see is no portrait of me..." Now, a less-than-stellar album would have stalled after the first four tracks. Not Technique. Guilty Partner scores another goal. The best word to describe it is beguiling. It's like being on a remote beach, at night. There is romance, but also mystery and intrigue. This is an obvious sampling of the Ibiza sound mentioned by other reviewers. The Spanish guitar work is first-rate, and Bernard Sumner's vocal delivery is moody and restrained, at once menacing and seductive. What follows next is Run, which employs more of the classic New Order sound. The lyrics grab you right away. Mr. Disco is a pastiche of most of the sounds you encounter in the whole of Technique, including that quasi-tubular bell sound that surfaces briefly in Fine Time. It's another addictive track. one thing that strikes me is how Bernard sings about a holiday spent together with a lost love, and then channels that into the declaration "my life ain't no holiday" in Vanishing Point. Another example of genius. Vanishing Point is a fan favorite, one that gets under your skin. The final tour-de-force is Dream Attack, another Ibiza tune. It overwhelms you just as much as Guilty Partner, and ends the album with a sense of urgency. Considering how Technique starts with Fine time and ends with Dream Attack, you can only conclude that only New Order could make it all come together in a compelling way. Basta, enough said! This is a treasure trove of mood and sound. 
Listen to "All the Way" then listen to "Just like Heaven" by the Cure. The bass lines are almost identical 
Well first off this cd is like all his other great cds which i have them all cause he sings from the heart and he is a true country singer that puts out quality music and i hope this new cd letters from home will be the same raw talent as he has put out in the past im looking forward to that on 4-20-04 sweettttttttt only complaint i have about JMM that he needs to come to WV its been awhile lol John Michael you roc 
This CD is awesome! I don't agree with those who think "Country Thang" isn't that great. I LOVE Country Thang! I think it'll be great as a single! This whole CD is awesome. If you havent got it yet, do so! You won't be disappointed! ;) I don't think John gets the respect and airtime he deserves. He's such a great guy, and very talented, he's truly thankful for what he's got and cares about his fans! Way to go John Michael, you got another winner here! : 
John Michael Montgomery has done it again. This is a absolutely wonderful album. I am in love with the songs "Till nothing comes between us anymore" and "I wanna be there". John Michael just seems to get better and better as the years go by. I highly recommend this album to any John Michael Fans 
John Michael Montgomery has always been my favorite country singer next to George Strait. John Michael's music has always though received less attention than deserved though he saw big success with Life's a Dance and Kickin it up but after those albums he kind of was always a second class artist. Big Mouths like Garth Brooks and Tim Mcgraw really yanked success for alot of artists in this buisness. Pictures is just another great album by this guy he sings what he does best on this record and that is ballads. Every song has something good to give although one track stinks Country Thang it just isn't John Michael Montgomery and is what stops this album from getting 5 stars his voice is too deep on this track and it is a ...song I also heard it is going to be his next single that is to bad because there are about 8 worthy singles on this record and I can't believe that song would go as a single. Great album though really good sound 
I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM. However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over. The entire album is pretty much "blowing flowers out of your [rear end]" types of songs. The title cut, "Pictures" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more. It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote. Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money 
This is just the best CD that he has put out since Home To You. Every track is great and his new label Warner's would be stupid if they don't release as his next single,Pictures,another I do believe I Swear for him,that was mentioned,my teenage son actually likes this song and he doesn't like too many of any kind of genre song,but this one he says is just great. I Wanna Be There has to come out next to follow up on his momentum to climb back up to the top of the country music business,than last but not least Believe In Me. THE ONLY SONG ON THIS CD THAT IS JUST BELOW JOHN MICHAEL'S SONG PICKS IS THE FIRST TRACK,COUNTRY THANG,IT IS JUST TOO STUPID,AND HE SINGS IT A LITTLE FLAT. The funniest and cutest song he have ever recorded is Four Wheel Drive,and my wife says he can put her into Four Wheel Drive anyday. Well,JMM you have done it again,and I read the fellow writer of an opinion Lois,from Newark,if those Country PD"s across the country have got to open their eyes and clean out those ears of those and give JMM a break he has earned BIG SONGS out of this CD and deserves them. Move over Tim and Kenny,and Brad Paisley,JMM has RETURNED WITH A BANG!! Great job JMM! We missed you and say to those PD"S HE STILL CAN ROPE THE MOON AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I SWEAR 
This album is a great one to get John Michael back into the game after changing record labels. With the exception of the first track, "Country Thang", which is only okay, the whole album is awesome. Track two is "Love Changes Everything", a powerful song about first love. Track three, "Til Nothin' Comes Between Us", is another in the long line of powerful and awesome love songs in John Michael's repertoire. Track four, "Got You To Thank For That", is a great uptempo song of gratitude. It rivals "You Are", another awesome up-tempo song, from his "Home To You" album. Track five, "Pictures", is like "I Swear" continued. It is awesome. A very good song. "Love and Alcohol", the sixth track, is a true to life barroom saga in three minutes. The seventh track, "I Want To Be There", is another awesome song about a father wanting to be around for all his daughter's important events in her life. The eighth track, "Believe In Me", is the strongest track on the album, in my opinion. It is a beautiful statement to someone you love who had been burned in a bad relationship in the past, saying that it will never happen again. Beautiful song. Track nine, "It Goes Like This", is a neat up-tempo, and track ten, "Four-Wheel Drive", is another neat up-tempo about, you guessed it, driving. This album ties "Home To You" as his best albums for his career. Truly awesome stuff. Get it. You won't regret it. I look forward to his next album 
What can I say,this album only has 1 weak track and that one is the 1st track,Country Thang,is just not up to John's caliber of songs we are used too. But from 2 to 10 take your pick everyone is awesome. There are 4 songs that should be put out as singles and just stick out a little more than the others. The title track Pictures,is another I Swear,I Wanna Be There,another-Little Girl(penned by the same writer),Believe In Me is just another classic JMM love song and I Got You To Thank For That,is just what we JMM fans have been hopeing for in a radio great sounding upbeat tempo song. Everyone of those songs belong to put out on country radio and those stupid country PD's acrosss the country should give him #1 songs,they are that special. There is quite alot of fun tracks that have people talking,Love and Alcohol and Four Wheel Drive,fun uptempo great songs.But,last but not least the great new song ,Til Nothing Comes Bewtween Us,is just another great love song,JMM seems to have a knack of picking out. Should become another top 10 hit for him,but it probably won't becuase the Country PD"s don't like JMM becuase he doesn't kiss ... for anything or anyone,which takes him out of big hit category,like country fav's Kenny Chesney and TimMcGraw. I listen to both of their recent entries and believe me,JMM rules and is a million times plus better than those. Buy this one,JMM has done it again!!!A+ material JMM!! Buy IT!! If you don't you will be missing out on the best album to come out of Nashville all year long 
great album. all of the ballads are so good. if you have kids or ever want to have kids, listen to "i wanna be there". best song on the album. "pictures" is a song that is worth buying the album too. "four wheel drive" my be the funniest song ever. you should be over 18 to listen to it. ha ha. "love changes everything" and "got you to thank for that" are great mid tempo songs that i can't stop playing. "country thang" is a great song too...good luck trying to learn the words to it. "believe in me" is another jmm ballad that never gets old. don't have a bad thing to say about the album. definitely buy it 
John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang. This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney. The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan's Where Were you. He mixes the soulful ballads, with his country rockers, and sweet love songs. THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan 
This record reminds me so much of the old records that my grandparents and parents used to play for me, and it reminded me of the folk pop albums i listen to today. It has so much soul. Just hearing Rise With Fists for the first time inspired me to buy not only this album but all of the Rilo Kiley albums. Jenny Lewis is truly inspired. This CD is simple and pure. And in its purity it takes you away, just like that music i have grown up to love and you don't see anymore in the days of my humps and sexyback 
If you haven't caught the video for the tune Rise up with Fists found on this cd...SEEK IT OUT! I caught the video on cable a couple times and immediately got into the tongue-in-cheek-this-isn't-country-well-ok-maybe-just-a-little-bit groove that Jenny Lewis and The Watson Twins deliver so effortlessly. This cd accompanied me on a 1200 mile road trip and let's just say that I wanted to drive another 1000 miles just to listen to this cd. Heads Up! This cd came out months ago. What are you waiting for? ; 
I was so suprized to hear the cute little red-head from "Troop Beverly Hills" put out this amazing album. The whole thing is a work of art. The lyrics are astoundingly soulful and leave you wanting to sing along. Jenny Lewis is like that girl down the street thats kinda depressed and scary, but totally hot and mysterious. She put a lot of heart into these songs and the lyrics are indicitive of some of her hollywood history, which is always nice of a former child star putting out an album to do, because we are all curious. I can't wait for her next album, I'm a fan 
Recently, while partoling the used CD section, I came across Jenny Lewis' solo debut, "Rabbit Fur Coat", I thought to myself, "hey, why not? It can't be that bad." Although I like Lewis' full time band Rilo Kiley, I never purchased this record for one reason or another, usually just forgetting to check for it when I went to the CD store, and figured that it would be worth the $5.99, plus tax, spent. Is it? Sure. "Rabbit Fur Coat", credited to Lewis and the Watson Twins, who provide ethereal background vocals to nearly every track on the record, is a strong, well written solo record, with a loose, intimate feel that makes it appear as if it were recorded by a group of friends late at night just for fun. The songs are atmospheric and melodic, a rariety in modern music, and Lewis has a good, conversational tone to her vocals throughout the record. The chief flaw of the record is the lyrics, that are often times overwritten, jumbled and, at times, silly. Many of the songs get by on the way the songs are being played and sung, but occasionally, most notably the peculiar title track, it is tough to get past at times. But the record doesn't fault from this because the songs are so strongly written and produced, and for the most part the lyrics are fine. I also have to give points for the excellent cover of the Traveling Willbury's "Handle With Care" in it's Byrds-esque glory, featuring vocals from Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard and, much to my dismay at first although he doesn't ruin the song, Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. As long as you are not expceting greatness from this record, just a pleasant, nice record, then "Rabbit Fur Coat" should please you just fine 
I absolutely love this cd. I listen to it practically everyday. However, I do find myself consistently skipping certain tracks. Namely, Big Guns, Charging Sky. . . AND, sadly enough, especially, Rabbit Fur Coat. My personal favorites are, Happy, Melt Your Heart, Born Secular, and God help me, Rise Up With Fists!!! I could listen to that song until I turned purple. Ugh. Brilliant.  I gotta say, I don't find [most of] the lyrics to be mediocure. I mean, sure they could have been better, but name one thing that couldn't stand to improve a little. 
I had not heard of Jenny Lewis until I encountered a review of this album on Amazon.com. It sounded interesting and, musically anyway, it has a freshness that made me want to like it. However, the tunes are not so good, nor the singing so fine, that either can transcend the lack of lyrical flair. In short, not one song on this album had words that were worth listening too. They scan badly too, making for some awkward phrasing. Not one of these songs will last 
I bought this record because I am such a fan of Rilo Kiley, but this record is far from sounding the same. I was not at all expecting to hear what I did. I was taken on a soulful journey of genres and it was truely beautiful with Jenny Lewis' crystal clear vocals. The questioning of religon is truely counrty but the funness to it makes it more pop. When you sit back and listen to the actually words you are blown away. "but what if god's not there?/but his name is on your dollor bill/which just became cab fare" 
It's a really, really good album. The slow songs all have a quiet beauty to them that make them endlessly listenable, the not-so-slow songs are a lot of fun--in fact, how great is it that she has a Traveling Wilburys cover on here?--and the lyrics are witty and interesting throughout. You can tell that the people making this record both care about what they're doing and are having a great time doing it, too. Definitely on my list of the 10 best for the year 
This album is unlistenable for one specific reason: backing singers. Is it "The Watson Twins"? If so, Jenny needs to AXE THEM. Seriously, the only GOOD tracks are those which feature JENNY ONLY (title track; "It Wasn't Me"). The rest is awful, overproduced studio glop 
I'm ordering simply because of "Some Humans Ain't Human" which is exactly right for those right-wing religious lunatics who have taken over the asylum and refuse to allow of any criticism of Bush. They spew venom and hatred, and send death threats to any artists who criticizes Bush. these hypocrites wrap themselves up in the flag and are too chicken to actually fight in this preemptive, illegal war, supported by lies. I've heard parts of this album and I think Prine is Divine. Bush's Administration is filled through and through with liars, cheats, crooks, thugs, murderers, grifters, and I've run out of adjectives. 
I can only laugh when I read some of these other reviews. As a performing artist, sometimes you just can't win. Many of the artists who are lucky enough to have been around as long as John Prine has, hear the old criticism over and over again, "I liked his older stuff better." Well, it seems many see this Prine release as simply "more of the same." So there it is - you change and you get criticized, or you don't, and you still get critized. I'm sure it doesn't mean much either way to Mr. Prine. As far as I'm concerned, that's the greatest thing about John Prine - his newer music is just as good as his older music. I agree with others who have called him a genius. I've been a fan since the 1970's and he is one of the very few artists that I just never get tired of. How could anyone who likes his music become tired of him? Each new Cd is breath of fresh air and quite similar to his original efforts, all at the same time. Thank God John Prine didn't come along any later than he did - he may not have been beautiful enough or mainstream enough for the present-day music industry. And we all would have been poorer for it. I cringe when I think about all the struggling artists out there who are turned down these days because they don't have the right look. It's a sad era for music. But, to the point - Fair Square is a gem, of course. Yes, it's a little more serious than some of his earlier efforts, but not entirely. But that's ok - "Happy Music" leaves me cold anyway. I like music that stirs up emotions and brain cells - and John Prine never fails to do that. If you're a John Prine fan, you will not be disappointed with this CD 
Just like Dylan, it pays off to wait for John Prine to release his latest insights. Fair Square is as much as a masterpiece as anything he has ever recorded. With his unique brand of lyrics and his voice which is a force of nature, Prine takes us back to the 1930's all the way up to the day you listen to him. What a great CD. It is one of those cd's that you really can't pick a favorite tune since they all hit you and take you to places and emotions that someone (like me who just hit 50), thought he had lost. I could list some of the lyrics here and go on and on but I will limit myself to just a few. "Crazy as a Loon" is as much a Prine song as I have ever heard but with an originality that only a true artist can present. Prine makes "Clay Pigeons" (Blaze Foley) his own while remaining true to the original. "She is my Everyone" is a great, bouncing, funny, John Prine original. "She is my everything, from her long black hair, to the freckles on her diamond ring". "Some Humans Aren't Human" should be played at the White House. Prine hits Bush and his right-wing supporters between the eyes with their hubris and arrogance. John Prine is a national treasure and I'm so happy I was introduced to him back in the "Dear Abby" days. I've been hooked ever since but that is not to say that those who have never tasted his wisdom and comments on human nature won't enjoy "Fair Square". My girlfriend (who had never even heard of him) absolutely loved it. I had to buy an extra copy since she won't give me mine back. If you haven't figured it out, I'm a huge John Prine fan and this is a great cd 
What can you say about another John Prine album? The man is a genius. And this album is worthy. I dig the dude who plays backup for him too. Saw them on Austin City Limits together 
I am a huge fan of catchy, country-folk music with insightful lyrics. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following: 1) Ghosts Of The Great Highway by Sun Kil Moon 2) Kings Avenue Joe Kile 3) Subtitulo by Josh Rouse 4) Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acre 
This CD is a great CD, but it is not what I think of as classic John Prine. John obviously is pensive and definitely a lot more serious on this CD and it comes through on most of the tunes. But the witticism is John through and through. I do have to say that I DO NOT agree with his politics and he ticked me off when I heard his words about Iraq, but I buy the CD for the music and most of the other words, and forgive him for his foolishness. I was an emergency worker at the WTC and I get very angry at how detached some 'folks' can be about the situation. But this is a free country (PTL) and everyone is entitled to an opinion - even when they are wrong. : 
I have a lot of John Prine music and I've loved seeing him in concert many times. That said, I really don't have a lot of interest in a CD where the artist has run out of ideas and essentially re-works his older material. This might not be what other Prine fans want to hear, but just because I am glad he's seemingly beaten cancer, I am not going to praise this weaker piece of work. I would have liked to have heard something from John Prine which didn't sound like a song he'd previously released. I've already got his old music and to be asked to pay for a slightly re-worked version under the guise of new music doesn't cut it with me. On the other hand, if you're new to John Prine, you can buy either this or his older music and you'll probably be happy. Hopefully Prine will return to creating new music and not just marketing his older work in a new package 
I purchased this for my husband But I ended up keeping with me love to listen to this mans voice and the way he plays worth buyin 
Johnny, what happened? A very whimpy John Prine, not the "Sam Stone" biting commentary I remember when. I bought this thinking I'd give Prine another chance. Unless he turns around on that road he's starting down, it'll be the last chance I give him 
I am a new fan of Mr. Prine. I am completely taken by this CD and listen to it every chance I get. There is not one song on the whole CD that you feel like "skipping over"..they're all great. Simple music, and absolutely enjoyable!! 
This is my favorite Christmas music -- just the right touch of light fun and reverence for the power of Love in the world -- sung by the heartbreakingly gentle voice of James Taylor. I could play it repeatedly for days and never tire of it. 
James Taylor's voice is like comfort food for the ears: distinctive but familiar, mellow and soulful. So it seemed inevitable that he would eventually put out a Christmas album, and as one might expect, his voice and laid-back style are a perfect fit with the material. My only criticism is that I wish he'd taken a few more chances with it. JT performs many of the standard chestnuts, like "Winter Wonderland", "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", and several others you've heard a million times before. But what really saves this album from the run-of-the-mill are his versions of some of the religious carols here, especially the gorgeous but little-performed "Some Children See Him", as well as "Go Tell it on the Mountain", "Who Comes This Night", and Holst's beautiful "In the Bleak Midwinter". He also does a pretty jazzy "Jingle Bells" (I would have liked more of this kind of arrangement, and less of those sappy strings). He presents a fine interpretation of Joni Mitchell's "River", which seems to be turning into a holiday standard; and a charming duet with Natalie Cole on "Baby, It's Cold Outside". Finally, he reminds us that "Auld Lang Syne" has more than one verse. JT hasn't lost his mellfluous touch, and I doubt you'll find a much better pop Christmas album this season 
I have the Hallmark rendition of this CD, and I must say that it is my favorite Christmas CD. If my family would let me, I'd listen to it year round. I've always been a JT fan, and this just frosts the cake for me. Don't miss it! It's yummy. 
...as noted elsewhere,almost all of it has been available before...The Hallmark album,which contains almost all of these songs,is now available at many"dollar"type stores,for a buck a copy,thus under-cutting the cost of this "new"album by about 90 %...and ,afterall,why pay more for something than one really needs to?As for Taylor,given his wide and undeniable popularity,one can only wonder why his"latest"release is merely recycled,previously available holiday tunes?Another question is why this recycled album has been given such a hefty pricetag?Even when brand spanking new(and not an item in the dollar store bins)the Hallmark album version sold for well under the price this item is being offered for..I,for one,enjoy James taylor's singing,even when he is singing christmas songs,and own many of his albums,but this release smacks of a popular entertainer who is trying to take advantage of his popularity...At christmastime most"big name" talents release holiday albums,but they sell at well BELOW the average cost of a "new"non-holiday album..Why should Taylor's RECYCLED holiday album be any different? Do yourself a favor...check out the local bargain or dollar store for the Hallmark edition of this album and save yourself some money BEFORE spending to get thie"new"edition... 
I've been waiting for this one for about 30 years. JT has the PERFECT voice for Christmas music, and does a fantastic job of ensuring that Christianity is an integral part of the theme (just as he does with many of his CDs). The best melancholy Christmas CD on the market 
I feel like I've spent my whole adult life with the music of Sweet Baby James, and this CD just rounds out my entire collection of his music. I have the Hallmark CD, but this new one is worth the price simply to add "River" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" to the holiday grouping. His rendition of the latter song really captures the poignancy that song is supposed to have. Play this CD, grab a glass of your favorite adult beverage, and go put up the tree. I'll take James' music in the background any day 
This is a very good CD of Christmas music from James Taylor. Jingle Bells is my favorite track. I've never heard this song performed in a blues style before, and it sounds very good. Dave Grusin and Chris Botti lend their talents on the piano and trumpet respectively on the track Winter Wonderland. They give this song an unique smooth sounding quality. In The Bleak Midwinter is a new song to me. I love the sincerity in James Taylor's voice. Dave Grusin's piano playing is very good too. The musicial arrangement on this track is beautiful. I like the duet entitled Baby It's Cold Outside with Natalie Cole, because it sounds so romantic. Go Tell It On The Mountain is an upbeat song. This is the first time I've heard all the lyrics to this classic song, and I really like it. James Taylor plays the guitar as well as he sings on the track River. This is a song about missing a loved one at Christmas time. Auld Lang Syne is a beautiful track about the meaning and importance of friendship. James Taylor has always had the ability to touch people with his voice. The music on this CD is proof of that. It is simply delightful. 
Whether you buy the original "A Christmas Album" or the new "James Taylor at Christmas" this is easily one of the best Christmas CD's you can find. 11 of the songs were produced by Dave Grusin, an accomplished composer and performing artist himself, "A Christmas Album" also features Natalie Cole, Chris Botti, John Pizzarelli and Mr. Grusin as collaborators. The songs are as enchanting as they are laid-back. There are gorgeous pop-jazz versions of "Winter Wonderland," "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" and "The Christmas Song". There is also an engagingly simple new-age flavored version of "Auld Lang Syne", an Elizabethan flavored version of "Deck the Halls" (on the original ACA and on the special edition of JTAC) and a funk-blues version of "Jingle Bells". Dave Grusin and James Taylor make great partners, particularly on the gospel song "Go Tell It on the Mountain". While I like everything on this album, three songs stand out the most for me; the straightforward and graceful interpretations of "In the Bleak Midwinter" and "Some Children See Him" and the tropical-flavored cover of "Baby, It's Cold Outside". This duet with Natalie Cole is easily one of the best versions, right up there with Louis Armstrong Velma Middleton's and Ray Charles Betty Carter's. "James Taylor at Christmas" includes the breathtakingly simple and beautiful cover of Joni's Mitchell's "River", produced by James Taylor and Charlie Paakkari, which manages to be sad and hopeful at the same time. The same can also be said about "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," produced by Russ Titelman and originally recorded for the album "October Road". JT subtly brings out the pathos in the song without losing its essential optimism. There's a reason this music has proven so popular in any version, these performances are just so good, you can enjoy listening to them over and over, even after the Christmas Season is over 
This CD is a jewel. The orchestrations are gorgeous and the voice is vintage James Taylor, just as warm and friendly as ever. It is a wonderful mix of secular and sacred songs, balanced and gentle. This CD will be a favorite for years to come. What a lovely early Christmas present. 
Great album. However as M.Flamm mentioned below there is another version of this 2006 release which has the bonus track, Deck The Halls, making the album complete at 13 songs. This limited edition is being sold only by Barnes and Noble. 
I purchased this CD after reading several of the reviews and generally liking TMBG myself. I must say I am quite disappointed with this CD. The music is, in my opinion, not engaging in the least and strikes me as way too complex for small children. Nothing on this album "stuck with me" in the sense that I did not walk away humming any of the songs after hearing them. In fact, I found a few songs to be so unappealing I either felt like I couldn't wait for them to end or I just forwarded to the next track quickly. I do consider myself to have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music and was surprised by my aversion to this CD. My recommendation is to consider this only for older children, say age 6 or more and, if possible, try before you buy 
Our family loves this album. It isn't just a series of quiet soft kiddy songs, but some that rock and some that are quiet. We can sing along with all of them. Our kids (2 to 9 years) like this album a great deal. It is a bit quirky, as might be expected from TMBG, but that adds to the variety of the music 
I have been "making" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to "make" them listen. My 6 and 7-year-olds actually "want" to listen to songs like "No!," "Clap Your Hands," and "Four of Two." Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is "Flood"), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD 
I teach a class of awesome pre-schoolers ages 2 and 3. I often get kids' music to play for them. This CD is by far the class's favorite. They love it! And I do too! It has appeal for kids and adults. These guys are so talented and in touch with their inner child. There are so many singer-songwriters who didn't make it who put out kids' music, thinking that a kids' audience will be easy: but they're wrong. Kids know what they like and they really like this album. It is a real stand out in an oversaturated market. Bravo and thank you 
I love this CD! THe songs are catchy and the kids like listening to them. In addition, they can put this into the computer and play with cute interactive animation while they listen... it had the whole family laughing 
As someone who has followed TMBG for 21 years, since their initial, self-titled album, this album, surprisingly, ranks among their best. The best since 1990's "Flood." There always was an element of silliness to TMBG, even though when I talked to the author of such ditties as "Toddler Highway" and "Minimum Wage" Flansburg he seemed quite offended that anyone would find their work humorous. "Our song are not jokes," he coldly remarked. Yet, like GREAT humor, Monty Python-level humor, TMBG's music has always been sometimes silly, sometimes highly intelligent, sometimes juvenile, sometimes poignant, sometimes too artsy for its own good, but always pushing the envelope. Oddly, it's like TMBG caved in to their worst criticism. TMBG has been tossed aside as kiddie music ever since I saw the video to "Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head" on "Nick Rocks: Videos to Go" and a TMBG poster was on Melissa Joan Hart's wall on "Clarissa Explains It All." Only they caved in and created the PERFECT kids' album! I got this album for my nephew and after one play was so satisfied to see both my nephew and his grandparents were thoroughly addicted. And addictive it is. After one play, the only way to get these song out of your head will involve very complicated surgery 
This CD makes a valuable addition to that all-important musical genre: Songs Kids Like to Listen to in the Car That Won't Drive Parents Crazy. I've liked They Might Be Giants for years, and now my kids (ages 3 and 6) like this CD. The songs are varied and fun to listen to, with lots of zany sounds and unexpected lyrics. Some of them are easy to sing along with, but I think it's the instrumental sounds on this CD that especially appeal to my kids. My 6 year old loves "John Lee Supertaster," and my 3 year old enjoys clapping and stomping along with "Clap Your Hands." "Robot Parade" is another big favorite for both kids. With 17 songs, the CD is long enough to play for quite a while without repeating (which is good, because no matter how much I might like a CD, there's a limit to how many times I'm willing to listen to the songs over and over and over). The last 3 songs are slow, and, though they don't quite put my kids to sleep, they do help them mellow out a bit. In all, this CD makes an excellent addition to our collection, which was previously perhaps a bit too Dan Zanes-skewed 
What a miracle -- a CD that mother and child both like to listen to! My daughter is 2 and is a picky listener. She requests CDs and even individual songs by name -- and this CD is a popular choice. One of her favorites is "Four of Two". She likes the rhythm changes in it -- she will dance fast, then dance slow, then fast again, right along with the song. I was surprised that she had the ability to notice these changes when she was less than 2 years, and it made me realize how many boring plodding children's songs out there are really not giving our kids enough credit. In addition to requesting "Four of Two", my daughter will jump around the house singing hippo! hippo! mop! mop! (from "Violin"), and swing her arms and sing "Robot Parade! Robot Parade!". And, being two and it being her current favorite word, she giggles at singing along with the word No over and over again in the song of the same name. "The Edison Museum" (a song with the word mausoleum!) and "Where Do They Make Balloons?" are my personal favorites. I will note that this is definitely not a CD to calm your child down or for relaxing. Most of the songs make my daughter get up and dance. Though we like some songs more than others, my daughter and I will listen to this CD from start to finish. What a relief not to have to hit the replay button and listen to "Elmo's Song" just one more time 
My kids love Elmo, and Dora and the Wiggles. Me, too - they're great! Elmo's Song is often in my head before I fall asleep. :) But No! is one of those CDs we all can listen to and enjoy. And then the No! song is stuck in my head. Which really is better. 
Tried and true, They Might Be Giants has given parents an invaluable resource... music to share! I have been a TMBG fan for many years and was ecstatic to introduce their quirky music to my then 18 month old daughter. Instant success. Their catchy lyrics are among the first she ever learned. I would definately recommend this CD 
I guess the headline says it all . . . I rented this movie from Netflix and found myself watching certain scenes over and over and over again just because the music was so great. I have been a casual fan of Guy Pearce for a while but his singing on this album and in the movie literally blew me away (I am always a little apprehensive when actors fancy themselves as singers-- remember Val Kilmer's terrible singing in "The Doors"?) But Pearce really gave himself over to the character and that whole-hearted transformation can be heard in these songs which are endearing, inspiring, and sometimes heart-wrenching. With movies trying to increase their gross income with a killer over-the-top soundtrack it was (and is) very easy to dismiss this album, but that would be a tragedy, Guy Pearce does an amazing job here and it should not be missed; the songs are simple, but no less magical 
When I first saw this movie, the music blew me away. I can't believe Guy Pearce has no other cd's, his voice gives me chills. Start Again is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard. I wish he'd get a band together and tour. Wonderful music from start to finish. 
I had no idea that the lead actor actually sang the songs until now, but I am blown away by the vocal performance as well as the songs chosen for this film. Amazing that one person can be that talented in interpreting music vocally as well as interpreting a complex character with emotive perfection. I also did not realize that this was the same fellow that was in Memento, which is another compliment--he is unrecognizable (to me at least) disappears from role to role. 
I'm always wary of actor/musicians as many sell mediocre music based on their popularity as actors. Guy Pearce is an exception to this trend. He delivers raw emotional vocals which are a perfect match for this mix of blues-rock songs and ballads. This CD is certainly one of the best original soundtracks I have heard in recent memory. 
Received quickly, good packaging, CD in promised condition. Will definitely purchase from this seller again 
I'm so glad I stumbled across this movie and CD. I hope Guy Pearce puts out more CD's....he's darn GOOD! If you like bluesy rock....you WILL enjoy this CD. :) The movies great too 
This is one of the best "new blues" album that I have come across in a long time. The music is insistant and real and Pearce's voice is raw yet still gentle. After suffering other actors-turned-singers (Murphy, Johnson, and fellow Aussie Crow) I was almost hesitant to buy the album, but it has been well worth it. I have had the album for two days and it has been in a constant rotation in my stereo. Some might say that because Pearce didn't write the songs that he is not a true artist, but it takes someone with true talent to put as much feeling and soul into the songs as he does. Guy Pearce is a true bluesman in my opinion. This is a must have for anyone who likes the blues, or even if you just want a good slow jam album. 
Hats off to Peter Alsop for singing and teaching in a gentle and direct way the very real problems of child sexual molestation. The lyrics are taut and flow together well and the tunes are catchy and register in the minds of listeners. I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Alsop perform and this work is well worth every cent. It is something that parents, educators, children and the world at large will benefit from. This is truly a stellar work. 
High school musical is the Disney Family version of "Grease". Our two young kids love the movie and the songs are very catchy. We even sing along and think the songs are great. This CD has 2 cds. The first CD contains all the main sings from the movies. The second CD is a karaoke (CD-G format) where you have the lyrics shown on screen, so you can singalong to all the tunes from the film. Lyrics are included in the folder along with a small film poster. Sweet film, sweet songs. It isnt a "Grease" type musical and it isnt a "Phantom of the opera""" type musical. Its a Disney musical for the entire family 
My kids loved the movie, and they sure enjoy the CD, learning the songs and singing with the kareoke version 
I love this CD the High School Musical did a good job for singing skills I love the CD and I do not get sick of it AWESOME CD! 10 star 
Buen soundtrack de la primera pelicula de disney que no es tan infantil el cd me gusto y no importa la edad que tengas las canciones estan pegajosas y son faciles de cantar ya que no se necesita tener la gran vo 
The speedy delivery was indeed valued.The disc was received in perfect condition and the production quality exceptional. My son is enjoying every minute listening to it. 
I was hesitant when somebodd told me that High School Musical was good. But I gave it a chance and now, I have to admit it, I love it! It has been awhile since I have seen something or heard something that is completely family friendly. I am single and in graduate school, but honestly, inuendos and/or bad language is not exactly something I love to listen to or watch in musicals and my music. I'm sure I am not the only one out there. Sure, this is intended for kids and it is great for that, but I was able to keep my mind open and watch and listen and it caught on with me. I think people need to relax and just take it for what it is...if it still isn't your cup of tea, well, to each his own. Unfortunately there was a bad review for this, but I am not sure why "it was stupid". I think it may have been helpful if there was some reasoning behind it.... However, I thought it was good because the tunes are catchy, the acting is good, the music was excellently composed, and the messages are good but not overly sappy and they give a message to kids on the importance of community rather than just "me and my self-esteem. 
Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last 
I just heard of these guys a few months ago on "Headbangers Ball: The Revenge" CD and I was impressed off the bat. So I decided to pick up their CD and it became one of my favorite albums. Starts off aggresive with "My Promise" the intro gets you pumped, this is probably the hardest track on the CD. "Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads" is one of my favorite songs on the CD, the song starts off hard within the first second of the track and breaks into a great chorus. "A Threnody For Modern Romance" was their first single and this is a great track. My personal favorite on the cd, fast and catchy with fierce vocals. "Naenia" shows off lead singer Nick's singing voice, which is pretty good. With all these metalcore bands out there its hard to find ones that are good. These guys are one of the good ones. They are also pretty young too and they have a lot of talent. With a new CD on the way for October, they're a band to look out for in 2006. Standout tracks: Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads, A Threnody For Modern Romance, Marigold, Naenia, Our Disintigratio 
This is a really good Cd by It Dies Today, they are one of the best in the metalcore scene, I would give this a 5 star, but 3 or 4 songs are just too heavy, It Dies Today make some seriously awesome tracks like "a threnody for modern romance" "The radiance" "Severed ties..." "Marigold" but the other tracks are just too much. Those tracks start out heavy but not too much, the singer is screaming his lungs out, it's allright, but then the whole band slows the tempo by a half and the screaming increases and that's when most people will stop listening. Now don't get me wrong this is a great cd but i just think it dies today should make more singing tracks 
It Dies Today is just one example of the bugeoning metalcore scene today. they really know how to kick a**. for other metalcore bands, try Cataract, Zao, Unearth, Underoath, Hedfirst, Showdown, and Killswitch Engage. Metalcore has a future 
I saw these guys live about a year ago in my little town of Johnstown before I knew who they were and they blew me away. They were a definite crowd favorite of the night and after hearing them I went out to buy this CD. This is a very awesome and heavy CD. I especially love Freak Gasoline Fight Accident, the title inspired by the movie Zoolander where Ben Stillers model friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, hahhaa, thats funny. Anyways, I am glad I got to see these guys live before they were widely known as they are today due to their music videos, it makes me feel special. The singer is awesome, I met him after the show, he is freakin huge 
For those who aren't very familiar with It Dies Today, this is not their debut recording. Their first album is called Forever Scorned, and it was released in 2001. The Caitiff Choir is their first album for Trustkill Records, but this is their second record. If you're expecting a complete copy of the first album, you may be dissapointed, because it definitely isn't. Don't worry, there are breakdowns and plenty of mosh parts, but you won't hear them in every single song. In many cases, this usually results in a soft sophomore record, a track many bands take in order to gain more fans or sell more records. So why does this album still get four stars? Because it's done right. IDT have managed to blend metal and hardcore intensity with pop hooks and harmonies without sounding the least bit soft. This is not an Atreyu clone by any means. IDT have their own sound and in a time where metalcore bands are more than plentiful, it's nice to hear a band with their own sound. When the metalcore scene fades in the next few years, this band will still be making music. There's nothing amazingly innovative or awe-inspiring, but the album hardly ever gets boring. Overall, a fun and exciting (yes, really!) album by a young band who knows what they're doing. Can't wait for the follow-up. Highlights include "My Promise", "Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads", and "The Depravity Waltz" 
Some people think of It Dies Today as just another metalcore band, but the fact of the matter is, they aren't an imitation band. This New York-based five piece formed in 2001, and they only just released their first full length album, "The Caitiff Choir," a little over a year ago (in 2004). It Dies Today are actually a very promising young band who show signs of greatness. Granted, they do sometimes sound like a lot of other metalcore bands, but they are catchier than bands like As I Lay Dying, and have more clean, backing vocals than bands like Chimaira. The members of IDT aren't the most mind-blowing musicians you'll ever hear, but the guitarists (Mike Hatalak and Chris Cappelli) play riffs which are typically quite fiery, and vocalist Nick Brooks is actually quite multi-faceted. He uses just the right amount of clean vocals, which (as in tracks like "Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads") offset his throaty, "I'm spilling my guts out" yells well. The final sound is quite energetic and intense. The album opening song, "My Promise," and "A Threnody for Modern Romance" have chugging riffs, pounding drums, and barked vocals (plus the latter track has the album's only guitar solo). Elsewhere, track seven, "Freak Gasoline Fight Accident" features propulsive, pounding power chords and thumping drums, "Out Disintegration" and "The Caitiff Choir Defeatism" are driven by heavy rhythms and fast, blistering guitar attacks, and, finally, "Naenia" has catchy chug and churn riffs. "The Caitiff Choir" may not be the most innovative album out there, but it sounds pretty great, and, with all the metalcore out there today, you could do a lot worse. As said before, It Dies Today are a promising young band who show signs of greatness. They're clearly on their way up, and it would be a huge mistake to write them off as "Just another metalcore band," without hearing this album, first 
no this is not EMO core i dont know who the hell came up with that idea...probably cuz they dont know music and dont know what they are talking about...and other people are trying to much to listen to "hard" music..well i fell sorry for you people because you dont listen to differnt stuff...so how does it feel to listen to the same stuff over and over again....and this band does not sound like atreyu because every one says that he sounds like a pig when he screams...and nick does not sound like a pig..... And to the person who tinks all there song sound the same is the most stupid person on earth....they have songs that are so brutal and songs that have nice melodic singing...every one who likes metal should give these guys a chance and dont listen to every one what they are saying you should listen to differnt stuff Also it does not matter what they look like..i thought in the metal scene it does not matter what you look like...its not a fashion show... Anyways these guys are the best band in metalcore music,very brutal My promise-10/10 very brutal song Severed ties yield severed heads- 10/0 the song that got me into IDT. The radiance- 10/10 great song..who care if its melodic...it shows that he can sing and he show it here....that is talent The depravity waltz-15/10-the best song on the cd A threnody for modern romance10/10 great song Marigold-10/10 great song,great lyrics Freak gasoline fight accident-10/10 cool name for a song The caitiff choir:revelations-10/10 another brutal song Our disintegration-10/10 this song will kick your @ss and you will like it and come back for more Neania-10/10 WOW! just WOW! i dont know what to say The caitiff choir:defeatism- 10/10 a great way to end the cd TOTAL:115/110 And i agree with THE ART OF BALANCE "Cotton Hell" that All you purists need to shut up with your "poser" and "sellout" antics and let the people who enjoy this music. thats all i have to say 
After hearing about It Dies Today for awhile, I decided to finally give them a listen and I was really surprised to hear how good these guys are. From the screaming to the mellow singing,this album has it all. I can honestly listen to this cd over and over again. They might not be the best band to ever come out but they do have potential and good talent. Keep it up It Dies Today 
Alright.. I'm not a huge fan of the whole death/thrash metal thing and I don't understand the whole Gothenburg thing but this music is unbelievable. The singer has the most amazing voice I've ever heard before including his screaming and singing. I wish more bands had the crisp heavy screaming they have. In this album he adds a lot more singing (very evident in The Radiance - which is probably one of the most amazing songs I have ever heard). if you are a fan of any rock and like some screaming buy this album. My Promise (5/10) This song doesn't appeal to me and no parts grab me but it is good to listen to if you are in a pissed off mood Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads (7/10) Awesome song with a singing chorus. The Radiance (10/10) Definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard... I can listen to this song 100 times a day and not get sick of it. The Depravity Waltz (6/10) Not really any singing but is pretty hardcore and a cool song. A Threnody For Modern Romance (8/10) Sick song with great balance of singing and screaming. Marigold (10/10) Another unbelievable song with great singing parts and the sickest bridge I've ever heard. Freak Gasoline Fight Accident (8/10) Awesome song with a broad range of voice. Revelations (5/10) All screaming .. dont feel too much for this one. Our Disintigration (6/10) Good song but isn't a standout. Naenia (15/10) This song is so full of emotion with an amazing introduction that gets you pumped and then a melodic chorus which shows off the singing too the fullest. Defeatism (7/10) Awesome closer but a little too long. 
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R R is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB: 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) 3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you) 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.) This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song 
I first saw Ne-Yo in his "Stay with me" video. I wasn't a fan of the song, but I loved watching him. I bought the CD and it stays in constant rotation in my CD player,and I don't skip over anything. But, the song that STAYS on repeat is #6 MIRROR! OMG! I love this song (for obvious reasons)! I also love Let Go, Sign Me Up, and Get Down Like That. I'm not going to go thru the whole thing and comment on every song, that takes to long. Just wanted to say, I love the CD 
Ne-yo first made an appearance by producing Mario's Let Me Love You track that made big at the end of 2004. He is an awesome singer and some of his hits include so sick, stay, sexy love, and Can't Let Go. everyone needs to listen to himn and yeah he has some good baby makin songs if that's your thing also 
Okay I've read the majority of the reviews and overall most believe that this new R songster is the BOMB!! Well, I join the rest of you on that note. This young brother put it down and I haven't taken it out of my disc changer since I bought it, my son kept begging me to go get it and I was telling him I don't want to hear it! How wrong was I. I like his originality and the tributes in sampling older R hits like Switch's "I Call Your Name". All the riff raff R artists out there like Omarion, B2K, Marques Huston and Chris Brown you got work to do. Ne Yo is on the scene and he came fierce!! Trey Songz and Mario to me rank up there with him because of they have a flavor that compliments old school R and thats the sound that we want to bring back. We ain't trying to get hypie! and crunk all the time. Those songs fade away 
It's difficult to find an album with all tracks rating 4/5.This is one of the albums which you listen over and over again. This is an absolute hit 
"So Sick" is another one of those songs that I saw steadily climbing up the Billboard Hot 100 before I ever even heard it. After I heard it, I couldn't get enough of it (and I still can't), and I was especially impressed that the song jumped from #9 to #1. I then decided to check out Ne-Yo's album In My Own Words to see if it was any good. And the answer is yes. What people probably don't know is that technically, this is actually Ne-Yo's second album; his first album was either never released or it never materialized; I'm not sure which. Also, I didn't know that the album's opener "Stay" (with Peedi Peedi) was released before "So Sick", because I didn't know that song had been released at all. But while I don't think that song is as bad as everyone else says, it's true that there are much better songs on the album. Highlights include "Let Go", "Sexy Love" and the smooth "Time". Another thing is that Ne-Yo writes some lyrics that don't look like much on paper, but they sound great when he sings the songs; such songs include "I Ain't Gotta Tell You" and "Mirror". "Let Me Get This Right" is also pretty interesting. The only tracks I can do without are tracks 4 and 5: "When You're Mad" and the aptly titled "It Just Ain't Right". The former is pretty stupid, talking about how sexy his girl is when she's mad (I think Ne-Yo himself realized this; notice how he released "Sexy Love" almost immediately afterwards?). I also think the use of the O'Jays' "I Swear I Love No One But You" sample in "Get Down Like That" was pretty lazy. But everything else on the album is great. I don't often listen to the radio, but if Ne-Yo is on, I wouldn't mind having him lay things out in his own words. Anthony Ruper 
Something about Ne-yo's first single shouted this album is going to be hot. Hearing about other songs he's written for other artists made me crazy waiting for this release. When I first listened In My Own Words I was not disappointed because I thought every song was on point in every aspect especially the production. The limited guest appearances is what I love most about this and especially since it's his first, I can't stand when a new artist has a bunch of tracks with a bunch of other artists on it. His lyrics are different and he sings about things guys are always thinking but never sing about like the single When You're Mad. I think the only flaw in Ne-Yo's debut is that radio stations are playing his music way too much because it's really starting to make me hate this album. All in all this is a killer debut and with Ne-Yo's multitalented mind he's going be able to stick around for a long time 
I'm not lying. I didn't think that this CD would get me the way it did, but I am singing all the songs and constantly playing the CD in my car. All the songs are quite soulful; he is a breath of fresh air for the crap that we've been hearing trying to passed off as R He is the epitomy of how R should be! I love it. All the songs, as the others said, are each great singles. My fav. songs (in no particular order): Stay Let Me Get This Right Sign Me Up You Aint Gotta Go Sexy Love Let Go BTW, I don't suggest the younger set to listen to this WHOLE album. Its mostly about sex, sex and more sex 
As far as Cheap Trick cd's go this one is no where near the best, but I would say it is no where near the worst as well. Underneath all the bad sounding 80's synths, is the heart of a pretty solid cd. The songs themselves are not bad. I know it sounds like a broken record (no pun intended), but I can think of no other band that suffered from lousy studio production more than Cheap Trick. If you were to take away the overbearing 80'e synths, and other stupid 80's sounds, and just strip the cd down to its essentials, what you would have hear is a pretty cool power pop record. It's Only Love I would say is one of the best song's from their 80's era (and it is the only song on here that escaped the synths and other useless sound effects and what-not). Name of the Game, has the same drum sound as their version of Terry Reid's Speak Now, from their first album. It is a song about how repetitive love is over time. The people are different, but it is all the same, and it never really changes. Having seen live concert video's from this era, you see how well these songs sound if it was just the band playing and no gimmicky production. I heard a live version of It's Only Love, and when they hit the chrous close your eyes and you hear Nirvana. It is what it is. It is proof that if the band had the proper people on their label in place they never would have sank into the nether regions of the 80's. Cheap Trick went back in the studio a few years ago with record producer Steve Albini, and re-recorded thier 2nd album In Color. I think they should leave In Color alone, and Redo this album, only with Tom Petersson's 12 string bass giving it that much needed low end. Some people might scoff, go ahead scoff. I suggest if you can play guitar, learn these songs, play these songs, and then you tell me they are bad songs. I would agree bad production, yep it sure is, but there is nothing on here as insipid as Wild Wild Women or Rock All Night. Nothing against Jon Brant, good bass player, nice guy, but he brought nothing to the band musically. I would really like to hear how this would have sounded with Petersson playing his 12 string monster on this. What this album really lacks is a low end. I think all post Tom Petersson cd's lacked that low end sound that he brought to the table. That and he could write songs as well, which made his contribution to the band more vital then just being a mere "hired hand." Re-record this straight-up raw live in the studio and I promise you the musically illiterate will sit down and shut up. Oh, and their worst CD...Busted 
Since MY 'RATING SCALE' is actually 4 stars tops, this album comes close, but I have to rate it at 3.5 stars out of 4. It's not quite as good as Next Position Please, or Standing on the Edge, but ANYTHING with Jon Brant in the studio (or for that matter live) beats anything the 'Tricksters did with what's his name on Bass. The album starts with a flourish as the first three songs are better than any 'first three songs' CHEAP TRICK WILL EVER do on an LP. Then the too slow and boring 'Are You Lonely Tonight' one of the least best 'first album side' [back in the days of vinyl, kids] songs in Trick's long (mostly) solid history of recordings, dulls things down. Then it picks back up the outstanding 'Name of the Game'. The second side is better than any second side in Cheap Trick recording history (except for the dopey, 'Good Girls go to Heaven,Bad Girls go Everywhere'). The last cut, "It's Only Love" not only is a very good song (not as good though as Take Me to the Top, Borderline, I Don't Love Here Anymore, Tonight It's You, or Saturday At Midnight, though), but the BEST VIDEO CHEAP TRICK EVER WILL DO! Being a Bassist in Washington, D.C. area bands in the middle and late '80's, we covered a lot of Police/Sting songs,Jason the Scorchers and ALL CHEAP TRICK FROM 1981-1987, INCLUDING Robin and other solo stuff (Bun E. Carlos Experience, but pls., not Rebe Jackson and Rob Zander, "You Send the Rain Away" - too much like the candy(ass?)/floss stuff on Busted and Lack of Luxury (except Don't Be Cruel Back in Blue, of course!) Jon's Bass work meshes perfectly with Bun E.'s power style drumming on 90% of the material here. No heavy-handed, two-left thumb-like 12-string Bass crap either! Jonny B Good used 4, 6, and 8 stringers here, kids! Some of the Pre-Jon stuff sounded awesome in concert too, once Jon ptiched the 12-string Bass, originated by Rick. God, they were so good when Jon was in the band! I miss those days like I don't know what...Bring Back Brant! Complaints, Brickbats, Boquets, Compliments to: [... 
An excellent CD , in fact I'm listening to it now. His just like Greta is worth the price but most of the songs are great. An excellent purchase. 
Great CD if you like the mellower roots of Van Morrison. Easy listening and terrific pace for those who appreciate the genius of Morrison 
Van Morrison keeps re-inventing himself. There are maybe 6-7 excellent songs on this recording, and I just love the mumbling, lazy voice he uses on a few songs. He plays his voice like a finely tuned instrument. There are several songs though, that he could have left out. But those are easy to take care of, if you've got an MP3 player.. 
This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best. This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues background...are all present on this CD. 
5 stars. Excellent. Funny how this artist's style is so different from one record to another. This is another reason why I love his music 
Three and a half stars really. Magic Time opens with the mellow Stranded that sets the tone for the album. The next one, Celtic New Year is a meandering ballad with jazzy touches. The tempo changes for the rhythmic and lilting Keep Mediocrity At Bay, a powerful message song. Evening Train is a mild uptempo rock number with a jerky beat and engaging saxophone flourishes, whilst both This Love Of Mine and Gypsy In My Soul are lounge jazzy excursions, as is his rendition of the standard Lonely And Blue. Just Like Greta is a soulful ballad that expresses the yearning for solitude and The Lion This Time is a sad slow song with a melancholy undertone. The title track, a relaxed ballad, is a celebration of happy memories, simple but moving. There is a mood of resignation in the face of betrayal in the bluesy piece They Sold Me Out. The album concludes with Carry On Regardless, a tuneful and rhythmic attack on the music business and the media. Measured against Van Morrison's own brilliance, I suppose this album deserves three stars. But compared to a lot of other music, it merits four. Overall, I would say it lacks real passion. But then again, the lyrics and the melodies are good. The songs just don't grab you like his best work does. Still, Magic Time is essential for fans. 
Great blues sound and great lyrics. I find myself listening to this CD when I want to just kick back and relax 
This a return to form for the master! The best album since "Days Like This". Evening Train, Gypsy In My Soul, and Just Like Greta are all standouts. If you think Morrison can't do it any more, think again 
This album is just fantastic, every song is good, the music flows right through you. Van Morrison at his very best, hope the upcoming album is just as good..... 
Highway 101's heydays were in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with an evolving cast of performers, but a compilation album of their greatest hits makes one realize just how good they were in that time. Especially good was the original cast of players, led by Paulette Carlson (of Hutchinson, Minnesota) and Cactus Moser - when Highway 101 is talked about in their place in country music, it should be about the group that has the four people on this album. Aside from their big hits (Cry, Cry, Cry; Just Say Yes, etc.), there are hits of lesser size on this album that sound just as good. The group ran headlong into some of the huge acts that exploded in the 1980s and therefore didn't receive all of the press that I thought that they deserved, but they were still very popular and a darned good group for their unfortunately short period of time. This album is thoroughly enjoyable and well worth purchasing 
Every one of these songs are good because they are their greatest hits 
Highway 101 wasn't around very long (the orignal lineup was together for 4 years), but what an impact they made in the world of counrty music. I really don't consider them a country act, more like a country/rock/pop act. With Paulette Carlson on vocals, Cactus Moser (who I think is often overlooked) on drums, Jack Daniels on guitar, and Curtis Stone on bass, Highway 101 had a unique way of getting a listener's attention. Paulette's husky, Stevie Nicks-like vocals are instantly recognizable and give each song that extra "kick". Catcus' drumming, although simple, fits perfectly with what the band was trying to accomplish musically-nothing fancy, but straight to the point and something you can tap your foot to. Jack Daniels is a really good guitarist who is often overshadowed by Paulette's vocals, but he could harmonize with the best. Curtis Stone not only provided nice bass lines, he also could play a mean mandolin. Another aspect of Highway 101's music is the harmonies provided by Cactus, Jack, and Curtis. Just listen to "Somewhere Tonight" or "Who's Lonely Now?" if you want to hear what I'm talking about. As far as this album, it has most of the band's best songs from the original lineup era, with the highlights being "The Bed You Made For Me"(co-written by Carlson), the classic "Whiskey, If You Were A Woman", and my personal favorite "Cry, Cry, Cry". If you aren't familiar with Highway 101, this is a perfect starter album to get a feel of what they were all about. Shortly after this album was released, Paulette Carlson left the band for a solo career. The band did continue with the beautiful Nikki Nelson, who was a good singer in her own right, but it just wasn't the same w/o Carlson. However, the band did achieve success with the 1991 album "Big Bang Boom", with the title track being one of my favorite Highway 101 songs. The band followed up "Big Bang Boom" with the 1993 album "The New Frontier" with no success. By this time, Jack Daniels departed and the band seemed to be on its last legs. In 1996, Carlson reunited with Daniels and Stone (Moser was not a part of the reunion) for 2 albums, Reuntied and Latest and Greatest, with no success either. Carlson and Daniels left Highway 101 again shortly after L, only to have Stone and Moser reform Highway 101 with vocalist Chrislynn Lee and guitarist Charlie White to record the album "BIg Sky" in 1999. The album didn't fare well, and in 2002 White left the band to be replaced by Justin Weaver. The band has plans to record a new album, and I for one would love to see that happen. If the original lineup got back together, that would be even better.. 
When Highway 101 burst onto the scene with "The Bed You Made For Me", I was so excited. They had such a fresh sound, but it was also a very traditional sound as well. But, to me, the highlight of the group is Paulette's vocals - I love women vocalists with raspy voices (Steve Nicks, Sam Phillips, Daniele Alexander, etc.,). The Greatest Hits collection contains almost all of their hits and it is very good. The only disappointment I had was the exclusion of the song "All The Reasons Why". There are two new recordings here("Change" and "Someone Else's Trouble Now"), both are excellent and do not distract from the other radio hits. My very favorite song of theirs is "Cry Cry Cry". This group was highly under-rated and deserves your attention. Unfortunately, I don't think this group is together anymore. But, with their traditional country sound blended with modern country and the incredible vocals of Paulette, Highway 101 is going down in my books as one of the best bands to ever grace country music. We miss you!!! 
I have not heard Highway 101 in years and when you hear this cd it really has great style contempary country music on it. This group really had the sound of nashville down and have that right country beat to there songs like classics with Somewhere Tonight and there music was great and they do not sound to hickish or to country at all 
This Is One Of The Great CDS To Have For Your Collection. Songs Like "The Bed You Made For Me", "Cry, Cry, Cry", "Somewhere Tonight" And "Whose Lonley Now" Are Great For This CD. They Started Out In 1987 And Ended In 1990. I Remember This Group 
This was a super band, especially with Paulette Ferguson. Every song on this album is excellent, wry in that ol' 101 way, with knocked-out guitar, drums and harmonies. My favorite cut turned out to be the very last one, "The Change," which I had never heard before. Glad I can buy this again, because I lent it out and never got it back 
First heard Jeff Lang on Prarie Home Companion and was enchanted with his impressive (but not bombastic) and confident slide guitar work and probing lyrics. Lang has a wonderful a blues/folk/rock hybrid sound that in a more just world would guarantee radio play time. The songs have a great grove, but without the crunch of heavier rock purveyors. This is a great find. Please do not confuse with Johnny Lang who has a clumsy, tasteless and self concious approach to blues 
Jeff is going to produce some brilliant music over his journey and he's got a monster talent to take with him. Having heard Jeff play live on eight occasions in Australia I can testify that his star is in the ascendancy and his voice is growing in strength and character. You'll hear it on later releases. The common feature of Jeff's playing at the great East Coast Blues Festival in Byron Bay is that when he starts up the wings of the stage fill with musicians from all over the world who obviously hear something very special. As for the reviewer whose comment that this is what passes for blues in Australia, I did cringe and get angry. It's gotta be good ol' home-grown USA rehashes of Son House, does it? Heard of Dave Hole, Jeff Achison, Chris Finnen, Pete Cornelius, Phil Manning? Nup, didn't think so. Besides, am I losing the faculty of sight because I haven't seen a THIS IS A BLUES RECORD sign stamped on any of Jeff's records. What made you this it was going to be total blues rather than a fusion? Commentary based upon bigotry and profound ignorance is pitiable. As we say here, pull your head in. Jeff's going to shake your world up 
Jeff Lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues. Another reviewer complains that he isn't Son House or Robert Johnson and so forth. Yeah, this is what... 60 years later? A blues fan for many years, I get tired of guys that can't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they didn't live in and perhaps didn't quite exist. Son House is fine, but he had limited musical talent. Jeff is not only technically talented, he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation 
Anyone who does not find this outrageously outstanding has got their head in the sand or is deaf. I've seen Jeff live and listened repeatedly to all his cd's. He's a virtuoso, he's exttreamly talented, He is cutting edge&gt; I should know. I'm a mobile DJ specializing in blues with over 3000 blues cd's. Miike Macy 
I came across this CD in a bargain bin, but after listening to it as many times as I have, I would now consider traveling to Australia for the sole purpose of seeing this guy live. The musical creativity coupled with the sly intelligence of the lyrics make this a rarity deserving of far greater renown. I can only hope that Jeff will provide us with more material in the very near future. Now would be fine with me. This is blues with a Harvard degree, if you ask me 
Jeff Lang is a one man explosive musical energy field. He is so good on the slide guitar that you are left shaking your head when he sings so well at the same time. The mood created by Jeff's bluesier songs is the kind that fits a long night drive so well. He rocks with the best and does it all so effortlessly. It is only a matter of time before this Australian wonder becomes a favorite of rock and blues fans every where. And with his deep talent, he will be be around for a long time. Buy this CD, that's all I can say 
"Rubber Soul." Like most baby boomers, I first heard this Beatles release as it was compiled by Capitol Records in the United States. It wouldn't be until much later that I'd discover "Rubber Soul" the way its original creators meant for it to be heard. Regardless, be it the United States or the United Kingdom version, this is a classic release either side of the pond! The acoustic-base that attracted me to the U.S. version, much akin to the feel I get from the first album by Crosby, Stills, and Nash, early Eagles, or "Listen Up... It's The Echoes," gives way to much more experimentalism on the U.K. version. Of course, Capitol was trying to stretch out the group's records to allow for more releases and, thus, more sales within the States. That said, songs from the U.K. version of "Help!" would surface on "Rubber Soul" in the U.S. while songs meant to be on "Rubber Soul" were destined for "Yesterday And Today," unique American release that it was. Singles, too, which were seldom included on a Beatles album overseas, would find their way onto American releases, but it didn't really matter to the fans who were eager to hear more of their favorite group from England! While "Help!" remains one of my personal favorites by the group, "Rubber Soul" runs a close second as it shows the band breaking new ground and taking their time in the studio much more seriously. John's words, George's solos, Paul's tunefulness, and Ringo's percussive explorations all make this an album worthy of any rock fan's collection! "Nowhere Man," "Girl," and "In My Life" are among some of John's finest mid-career work while "If I Needed Someone" shows George emerging as a force to be reckoned with. "You Won't See Me" and "I'm Looking Through You" display Paul's pop sensibilities at their best, despite the fact I always think of "I've Just Seen A Face" as a "Rubber Soul" number due to its original inclusion on the U.S. version. Of course, this number truly belongs on the "Help!" album, but that's what growing up with Capitol releases does to someone forced to contend with the compact disc era! Ringo even gets a song-writing credit on "What Goes On," a pleasant country number that would pave the way for "Don't Pass Me By" on the "White Album." It being pointless to go on and on singing praises of the Beatles, a mild fan wanting familiar songs should stick with a greatest hits compilation, but a serious fan of the Beatles or rock and roll in general can't go wrong with this release! Highly recommended 
What is there to say? It's the BEATLES! I love this and all their cd's althought this one rates a little higher up the scale 
The Beatles were the ultimate fusion artists, melding pop, rock, country, eastern scales..really whatever caught their interest..into the next generation of pop music. In fact, the Tin Pan Alley popular song writers were more sophisticated in melody and harmony, but no one before the Beatles was as all-encompassing in their use of diverse musical resources combined to create popular music. Everything since as been relatively trivial 
I owned the album as a kid.......I enjoy it as much now as I did then 
I purchased this album in 1966 and was blown away, but first had to readjust from the Fab's earlier works and learn to appreciate how different Rubber Soul was from Help, yet still analogous. I mean, we all knew it was the Beatles when I've Just Seen A Face (American release) leaped into our ears upon our first listen, but they had transcended their classic sound a year earlier, surpassing anything they or anyone else had come close to perfecting prior to Rubber Soul. I'm still marveled by these lads, who were in their early 20's during the time Rubber Soul was composed and recorded, and their incredible sophistication for only being barely out of their teens. It's always been difficult for me to listen to anything new without comparing it to their standards. I guess that's not a grumble. I was so lucky to be elevated to this level of music appreciation at such an early age that it has forever changed my manner of thinking. This is one heck of a classy album and my fave forever! It just keeps getting better with every listen. If I may borrow John's line - "In my life...I love them more! 
I love the Beatles and Rubber Soul is one of their greatest albums! I used to dance around the living room, singing my heart out when I was a kid. Good times! My Mom was a Beatnik in the 60's and was definitely into the Beatles. She still says Rubber Soul is a good album. I agree! 
I got hooked on The Beatles' music by listening to my parents' records as a child. I have collected all of their albums on CD up through Rubber Soul. In my opinion, I think that Rubber Soul is their best album. Shows the band at the height of their career. Their songwriting had become more mature and less teenybopperish. After Rubber Soul, their albums are more drug-influenced and less of a group effort and their songwriting becomes sub-par, with the exception of a few gems here and there. To here those few gems, I recommend getting Beatles 1 
It's the Beatles so it is GREAT! But...I guess I missed in the description or it wasn't there that this is NOT the same as the album I loved as a pre-teen. It must be the world or british release as it is missing songs and has songs that my lp does not. This is fine but to evoke the memories of long ago the order of songs and familiarity from hundreds on listenings as a youngster is missing. I actuall prefer to play the old lp and I am not someone who prefers crackles and pops in my music. I guess I'm not really happy with it 
I just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation. In this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round. That song is not listed on the song track and I think it should be. The song is Atrevido by Orishas. I think this is wrong. 
Do not buy this CD or any other CD either made by Sony or labeled "Copy Protected". These CDs are known to be infected with DRM and contain programs that compromise the usability and security of your computer. Anti-virus programs are now classifying these DRM programs as rootkits and are cleaning them off of the infected computers 
This is one of those Sony CD's that contains "XCP" spyware. XCP was written with the intent of concealing its presence and operation from the owner of the computer, and once installed, elements of the software run continuously -- even when no Sony-BMG music CD is in use. It provides no clear uninstallation option. Additionally, without notifying users, the software appears to contact a remote machine under your control. Sony has shocked and angered people over this issue. Software that deceives the owner of the computer it runs upon and opens that computer up to attacks by third parties may be expected to come from malicious cyber-attacks; it is certainly not expected nor acceptable to be distributed and sold to paying customers by a major music company. Sony should temporarily halt manufacturing CDs with XCP and reexamine "all aspects" of their "content protection initiative." If Sony truly intends to undo the harm that they have caused, they should immediately and publicly commit to the following measures: 1) Sony should recall all CDs that contain the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology. It must include removing all infected CDs from store shelves as well as halting all online sales of the affected merchandise. A recent New York Times article said that well over 2 million infected CDs with the XCP technology are in the marketplace and have yet to be sold. 2) Sony should remove from all current and future marketing materials statements like that on http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/updates.html that say the cloaking software "is not malicious and does not compromise security." 3) Sony should widely publicize the potential security and other risks associated with the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology to allow the 2.1 million consumers who have already purchased the CDs to make informed decisions regarding their use of those CDs. The publicity campaign should include, at a minimum, issuing a public statement describing the risks and listing every Sony CD, DVD or other product that contains XCP or SunnComm MediaMax. The publicity campaign should be advertised in a manner reasonably calculated to reach all consumers who have purchased the products, in all markets where the CDs have been sold. 4) Sony should cooperate fully with any interested manufacturer of anti-virus, anti-spyware, or similar computer security tools to facilitate the identification and complete removal of XCP and SunnComm MediaMax from the computers of those infected. In particular, Sony should publicly waive any claims it may have for investigation or removal of these tools under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and any similar laws. 5) Sony should offer to refund the purchase price of infected CDs or, at the consumer's election, provide a replacement CD that does not contain the XCP or SunnComm technology. For those consumers who choose to retain infected CDs, develop and make widely available a software update that will allow consumers to easily uninstall the technology without losing the ability to play the CD on their computers. In addition, consumers should not be required to reveal any personally identifying information to Sony in order to access the update, as Sony is currently requiring. 6) Sony should compensate consumers for any damage to their computers caused by the infected products, including the time, effort, and expenditure required to remedy the damage or verify that their computer systems or networks were or were not altered or damaged by XCP or SunnComm MediaMax products. I'm not buying any more Sony CD's until they do the above! 
Don't play this CD on your PC, it does something that screws up the operating system. I had to re-install Windows :-(

I have always been a huge fan of Donell Jones, ever since the release of his debut album "My Heart." Since then, each album seems to get better and better. "Journey Of A Gemini" has a genuine R sound that many artists out there today just can't seem to find. The only thing I dislike about the album is that it definitely doesn't get enough play on the radio or enough publicity. Someone as talented as Donell should be in heavy rotation. My favorite songs on this album (although I LOVE them all) are 1. Ooh Na Na, 2. Feelin You, 3. I'm Gonna Be, 4. Better Start Talkin. So if you love R with a classic sound, you can't afford not to have this in your collection 
This by far is his greatest work. Every song on there from 1-15 was pleasant. The name of this album should have been press play. I found myself listening to this cd all night. My faves include You Better Start Talking, Ooh Na Na, and Portrait of a Woman and also Cry ( I think that's what the song is called.) But overall it is a great cd. If you are an R fan then you will love this cd. I feel it was money well spent. He doesn't get the recognition, or promotion needed. Donell if you're out there I will promote you boo.. 
this CD is probably his best work. this CD is soooooo hot! most definitely worth every single penny. i would recommend it to ANYONE 
Donell Jones has always done it for me, and I must say, this time is no different! As far as I am concerned, he is the best R male today! Unfortunately, he really doesn't seem to get enough media attention, and I have yet to understand that. In addition to his music being able to pull drawers off of any woman alive, he is absolutely gorgeous! That could just be me! Anyway, sorry people, but I feel Journey of a Gemini is a far better album than Avant's Director, not really taking anything away from him either. If you enjoy the old school love songs and wish there was more of that today, pick up this album. You won't be disapponted 
I love this record. This album takes us music lovers on an intimate and sometimes explicit journey into both sides of his interestingly opposing split personality. He named this album, you know it, because of the experiences he was facing while recording this record. This album is up-tempo driven and lovemaking songs. This album shows that he has perfected the ability to blend old school soul with an edgy hip-hop sound creating songs that appeal to us music lovers. THIS ALBUM DESERVES BETTER PROMOTION 
This is my first Donell Jones' CD, and I can truly say this is by far perhaps the best CD I've heard in several years by any artist. The tracks from start to finish are great, and I found myself listening to the CD all day the first time I played it. What prompted me to buy the CD was the song I'm Gonna Be which I hear more on my satellite radio stations than I have locally here in Michigan. And because of the quality of music, I very rarely buy CD's anymore, however, after hearing I'm Gonna Be, I was telling a friend how much I liked that song and my friend happened to have the CD and only after listening to maybe 3 or 4 other tracks, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I LOVE THIS CD - GREAT JOB, DONELL !!! What I am disappointed in is the lack of promotion for this CD. It just burns me up when there are some non-mainstream artists with a great product and for whatever (dumb) reason, the marketing depts. of the record companies that don't actively promote artists such as Donell Jones who have quality products. There isn't even a video out, which in this day and age, an artist must have a video to further promote their product(s). So shame on JIVE RECORDS (and all the other record companies) who don't actively and aggressively promote CD's with the quality that this one exhibits. I recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate good quality R - both youngheads and oldheads (I'm an old head in my mid-40's). I have been doing my own promotion for this CD and will contact my local radio stations to ask that they include I'M GONNA BE in their rotation. 
One great listen from the beginning to the end. Great work from Donell Jones, by far his best cd yet 
I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive "Journey of a Gemini", or "Blue Collar Music". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you. 
Donell Jones peaked with his "Where I wanna Be " Album seems a long,long,long time ago now. back then when his cut "U know what's up" was getting much play Usher his then LaFace Labelmate was in his video like a extra. talk about time changing things? fast forward to now has this album out which for the most part sounds like a artist just going through the motions to get out of a Contract. not One song stands out here. he is being forced to work with outside writers ain't really him can tell. vocally He still is good,but the material leaves alot to be desired on a whole 
Aaron Neville has given me so much pleasure with his singing over the years. This seriously professional CD is his latest and it furthers my belief that he is a world class act, that should not be missed 
I am a big Aaron Neville fan and I like all of his music 
This CD is great. Aaron Neville has one of the most distinctive voices in the industry and his rendition of these classics is pure gold. Sit back, have a glass of wine and enjoy 
Some of the greatest tunes, being sung by one of the greatest singers ever. I don't have a problem with that in itself, just the way things are going in the music business: When an artist of Neville's stature can't expect to sell a cd of good new material. Isolated cases are not the problem, it's the trend, with former greats such as Rod Stewart and Aaron Neville so locked into one era of oldies or another that creativity has become a negative. Nonetheless, please re-read the first sentence. 
is Neville's voice. I recently saw him at a local venue, where he performed a lot of the music on this fine CD. I hadn't purchased any Neville music since his great jazz memories album, "Nature Boy" -- but I went right out and bought this. Neville's not afraid to remake Sam Cooke or Percy Sledge, and his take on "Stand By Me" and with Chris Botti's trumpet on a new mix for "Rainy Night In Georgia" permeate your thoughts and just about make you forget the originals. Neville did this CD as a tribute to Katrina victims, and his own family's difficulties as the result of the storm. A consummate performer, with a voice that just doesn't quit, Neville is even more at home with sould classics than he is with gospel or jazz. Run, don't walk, to buy this CD 
There are quite a few albums lately with artists covering songs already made famous by other artists. This is one of the better ones because it's a totally new interpretation of older hits. It kicks off with the classic 'Rainy Night In Georgia' and you've never heard it done like this before. With the different arrangements, etc, it's totally awesome as is "Dock Of The Bay'. Neville's falsetto can be sometimes quite annoying but he keeps it slightly under wraps here. An album worth buying 
I love the voice of Aaron Neville. I also love all the performances of the musicians on this CD. My favorite track is Rainy Night In Georgia. Chris Botti gives this track a smooth sensual quality with his trumpet playing. He compliments Aaron's vocals well. Respect Yourself is a fun upbeat duet with Mavis Staples. Lets Stay Together is another highlight duet with Chaka Khan. They harmonize beautifully together. Sittin on The Dock Of The Bay is a groovy sounding track especially with Ray Parker Jr. on the electric guitar. I love the tone of Aaron's voice on the track You Send Me. It sounds very pretty and romantic. It's All Right and People Get Ready are really uplifting tracks. Aint that Pecuilar sounds so soulful and energetic. I love Aaron's rendition of this song. Stand By Me is one of my all time favorite tunes. It is a great song about friendship. Joe Sample's piano playing is so good on this track. Bring It On Home is an excellent CD of classic soul songs 
I love Aaron Neville. He can make average songs sound like masterpieces. But here he is singing the masterpieces, so imagine how they would sound like. This album is pure gold. I have been listening to it over and over again since I got it and I have been recommending it to all my friends too. Its tough to chose a favourite from this brilliant album but I think "People Get Ready" has the most emotion in it. Treat yourself to the joy of Aaron Neville's soulful vocals and decide for yourself. The tracks are : Rainy night in georgia (feat chris botti) Aint no sunshine (Sittin on) the dock of the bay Stand by me You send me Respect yourself (feat mavis staples) When a man loves a woman Lets stay together (feat chaka khan) Its all right People get ready (feat david sanborn and art neville) My girl Aint that peculiar A change is gonna com 
Aaron Neville definitely has one of the most inescapable voices of today. He is versatile as well which may very well be his draw or his appeal. He can sing rock, country, pop, jazz, and soul equally well. There are very few singers that can pull that off. Here, Brother Aaron returns to form after his exceptional jazz standards album with soul classics. Sure, maybe the classics don't have the vigor of the originals sung by the original artist, but the vigor of Aaron Neville with his mellow, yet soulful vocals is present from the opening "Rainy Night In Georgia" to the chilling closure, an exceptional remake of Sam Cook's classic "A Change Is Gonna Come". Something that perhaps Neville can boast of is the fact that his voice doesn't sound the least bit altered by age as some of his contemporaries have been. Aaron sounds as strong as he did in 1967 when he was singing the classic "Tell Me Like It Is". Ultimately, there is no need to go through every track and critique them. For the most part, the arrangements are simple, but not so simple where the album sounds cheap. "Ain't No Sunshine" for example doesn't quite have the same feel as the original Bill Wither's take,but it is soulful nonetheless and features some character from Neville which makes it very enjoyable. "You Send Me", another Cooke classic, is well sung here by Neville with both the simplicity that Cooke sang in the 1950s as well as the soulfulness of Aaron Neville. "When A Man Loves A Woman" is as beautiful a take as I've heard and "People Get Ready" is another standout. I could continue to praise all the rest of the numbers but there is no need; they are all consistent. My largest criticism might be that the guest collaboarations don't necessarily make BRING IT ON HOME any better than it would've been with just Aaron Neville. However, what is good is that the spotlight is on Aaron Neville and the album is simply immaculate, as always. 4 stars. 
Prince is a musical genius. 2 words...BUY IT. You will not regret this purchase 
This set collects two discs of Prince's greatest hits, plus a bonus disc of "b-sides" which were previously unavailable on album. The hits speak for themselves; "When Doves Cry", "Kiss", "1999", "Little Red Corvette", etc. But what's really interesting to Prince fans is the "b-sides" disc. These songs were previously hard to find (unless you owned his original singles), and it's great to have them all on one disc. Some of these songs are as good as his hits. The disc even includes my personal favorite Prince song, "Erotic City". So, even if you already own all of Prince's albums, this collection is worth getting for the "b-sides" disc 
After purchasing the 3121 album, i was jonesing for some old Prince, i had some of the major hits already i've downloaded throughout the years, but wanted more. After doing a little research, everything i wanted, was in one set...the hits/b-sides! Im not even a huge Prince fan, just like some of his stuff, but i have to say, after paying this 3 disc set, WOW, this man could be a genius! Not only does it have all the hits i wanted, and have grown to love, the b sides cd is just as good! My surprise hit...Another Lonely Christmas! I love that song!! I'm a fan of music, and in this 3 disc set, is the best collection of music and songs anyone could ask for. Prince is the man, plain and simple! If you don't think so...go buy this album, and see for yourself! 
There's so much quality collected here, I have to give it 5 stars. A few years ago, I was in a record store, and I saw the Hits 1 and 2. I liked more songs from Hits 2, so I picked that one and bought it. I loved the music so much that I went back and bought Hits 1. This started me on a Prince whirlwind. I proceeded to buy the Batman Sdtrk, Parade, Purple Rain, Girl 6 Sdtrk, Sign O' The Times, For You and Prince. Then I find out that the Hits 1 2 were apart of a 3 cd box set, but the 3rd cd isn't sold separately. Isn't that a blip? I want the disc of B/sides, but I don't want to pay for the Hits 1 and 2 again. It would be double-dipping. Like I said, Hits 2 is a better album than Hits 1, but Hits 1 is still stellar. Some songs shouldn't be on here: Cream, Pope, Peach. These 3 songs are horrible in my honest opinion. A couple of his hits are objectionable to me as well: Delirious and Dirty Mind. The former being the corniest sounding song from him I've ever heard; and Dirty Mind is simply mediocre. Cream, Pope, and Peach should have been replaced with 3 of the tracks from the Batman album: Scandalous, Batdance, and Partyman. The great thing about this collection is that it turns you on to much of his music that is missing. A desire is raised to listen to his album tracks and the extended versions of the edited cuts. But Prince's albums haven't been remastered. I will admit that all of the albums I bought from him sound good, except Sign. Obviously they transferred that LP to CD at a much lower volume and sound quality than the aforementioned albums. And it irritates me. Anytime I feel like listening to my fave Prince song in full length (If I Was Your Girlfriend), or any song from Sign, I have to turn the volume up really high. Prince is one of the biggest and most important artists ever, yet no remastering. You have artists who came out 10 years ago getting remastered, but not Prince. If the sound quality of Sign wasn't so bad (this was my last Prince purchase), I wouldn't be so afraid to pick up MORE earlier albums like Controversy and 1999. You have a fan who wants the music and is willing to pay for it. Get up off your laurels and remaster the music 
I will not wax philosophic about this collection only to say that if you're a fan of Prince this collection has to be the best I've ever seen. You may wonder why I gave this collection four stars...well, to be honest...the collection of songs on the third disc just didn't do it for me personally...creative yes...enjoyable to listen to - no...the first two discs were fantastic...in fact, I replaced the 3rd CD with my "Gold Experience" CD...now my portable Prince collection is perfect! 
People throw around the word "genius" very casually...if they're referring to the mighty little purple one, they might be right...This is just an incredibly bountiful collection, from one of the greatest pop songwriters ever from any era...one of the greatest purveyors of funk, too! All of his mega, greatest stuff is here, as well as some mighty tasty b-sides. Superb 
The only reason.. and I mean the ONLY reason this does not get a 5 star rating is the unacceptable abscence of "Alexa De Paris". Probably the best instrumental song ever made. 
Really, I mean three discs! How much more do you want? This set conciseley covers Prince's greatest hits and almost/should have been hits. While obviously lacking in extended mixes, "imports", and other rarities, a great body of groundbreaking work is included here. From the late 70s to pre-symbol, everything you remember from the radio is here in the first two discs. Its a huge collection of truly greatest hits from an extremely prolific and talented man. (Not like one of those compilations of 6 songs you love and 5 you've never heard that some artists put out.) THE HITS 1 2 is perfectly sufficient for the average Prince fan. For those of us who like to go a little further, the third disc (The B Sides) is a virtually uncomparable collection of sometimes hard to find work. Some songs are obviously jumping points to other better known hits. Interesting as far as creation/inception knowledge, but sometimes redundant and frustrating. Some are the best kinds of songs, ones you heard a few times (or more) and forgot how much you loved them. Regardless, this disc is a collection that would be nearly impossible to put together on your own. Unless you're a collector, which is an entirely different matter. The CD booklet was, to me, one of the more interesting parts. Done in an almost biographical format, it contains interesting information that I had forgotten about, or never knew at all. It reads like a story, reminding you that some of the music that sounds almost weak now was, at the time, groundbreaking. Though sometimes it is preaching to choir that is already converted, it's a choir that likes to be reminded. This set is great for the average to borderline fixated fan, or for people who missed the early days. (If you're an 80's kid/fan, be prepared to buy disc 2 a few times.) Not nearly enough for the obsessed, but that's what import and specialty stores are for! 
Prince is truly a one of a kind artist, muisician, vocalist and lyricist. This collection of hits and b-sides is so good that I do not know what I should truly write to justify his amazing genius. Songs like when doves cry, 1999, purple rain, controversy and so many more are some of the best funk/rock tracks ever written with stupendous lyrics, tremendous vocals, and melodies that are breathtakingly good. There is now way that I can do Prince justice in this brief review but I consider him to be one of the best rock/funk artists of all time and this is a must have for anyone that likes amazing music or is a fan of Prince 
Alan Jackson is a true country singer who sticks to traditional country songs. This album features many of those songs such as "Midnight in Montgomery," "Chasin' That Neon Rainbow," "Don't Rock the Jukebox," and "Tall Tall Trees." It features a very impressive collection of songs that will go down as some of the greatest ever recorded. I rank this as one of my favorite albums, and I'm glad I got it. AJ is truly a great singer. If you can find this album, get it 
i got this CD when i was 5 and i still have it i have gone to all of His concerts (in miami) and i absoloutely love Living On Love. i have listend to this cd for a long time it has to be one of his best ever!! 
The CD is comprised of some of the best songs Alan Jackson has sung. It's one big hit after another. Great to sing along to 
This is a great collection of hits. It's great to be able to buy these cds where you like every song on the cd and not just one -- that's why I but the collections of hits, but then you can't go wrong with Alan Jackson 
If you have only 10 Country CDs, this should be one of them. Alan Jackson is one of the best around today, and this CD is a collection of many of his most engaging songs. They're also great for dancing 
A lot of greatest hits Cd's offer five or six great songs and a few lesser known hits or some filler. This collection of hits from Alan Jackson is absolutely marvelous. It captures him in his fresh prime during the early 1990's with number 1 hit after number 1 hit. There are 20 cuts here and there isn't a bad song anywhere. My favorites: Don't Rock The Jukebox, Chasin' that Neon Rainbow, Tall Tall Trees, Love's Got a hold of you, Dallas etc. etc. Well, you get the idea. This is one of the greatest "greatest hits" Cds on any genre. Time will prove this CD an essential purchase of what high quality neo-traditional country music was all about. The sound is also a knockout. 
Alan Jackson has been producing top ten hits for years, and this great cd contains all of the best from the early part of his career. From classics such as "Summertime Blues" and "Chattahoochie" to ballads such as "I'll Try" and "Wanted", this disc contains something for every country music fan. Alan's great backing band has never sounded better, and his flair for fun, off-the-wall songs such as "I Don't Even Know Your Name" make this disc that much more fun to listen to. If you're a fan of country music, then this collection of hits is an essential addition to any music library. Pick up this great disc by Alan Jackson and hear some great country music at its best. 
CD is in good shape, got here quite fast; altogether, a nice experience 
This CD is still one of my favorite Alan Jackson CDs. This CD has a more traditional tone than some of his newer stuff. And of course, since it is a Greatest Hits CD, every song was released and successful. From the smash hit "Chattahoochee" to "Don't Rock the Jukebox" to "I Don't Even Know your Name," this CD is almost sure to have songs any country fan would recognize and enjoy 
Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler. A must-have. By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's "songwriting skills need work"?! 
I love the concious rap, the nature of it is so real. I can go by these tracks because of what they represent; the essence. The top 5 songs of the album: 1 The Blast 2 move somthin 3 Down for the Count 4 Good Mourning 5 Eternalist 
I'm always up for intelligent hip-hop, and "Reflection Eternal/Train Of thought" is filled to the brim with creative rhymes, head-bobbing beats, and powerful messages. For example, "Too Late" is a song that mourns hip-hop's downfall. "Nowadays rap artists coming half-hearted/Commercial like pop or underground like black markets/Where were you the day hip-hop died?" It's so true it's almost eerie. Plus, the beat is amazing. Another note-worthy song is "Name of the Game". An amazing piano sample plays in the backround, and Talib's crazy MC skills are practically jaw-dropping: "'The name of the game is..' Persistance, dedication Consistant motivation Resistance to stagnation of information Distribute it free to the entire population No hesitation Makin it public No privitazation from corporations" Genius!! Seriously, no true hip-hop collection is complete without this gem. "RE/TOT" is sure to be remembered for years to come 
This is an absolutely amazing album created by the reflection eternal. Another release that focuses on making classic songs that mean something positive to people. Songs that you can play twenty years from now and they are still dope and relevent to your life. Support emcees that have talent, not materialistic artists that make songs that will help you into a jail cell 
I have been a NY music junkie since roughly 94' and through all the years and all the different albums "Reflection" is still my favorite and the most complete album Ive ever heard. For anyone contemplating this album please check it out. Talib is by far one of the most gifted MC's to ever spit and when you combine it with the smooth Hi Tek beats it creates a really good vibe, that should be a MUST own. Ive always liked Kweli but nothing has yet come close in the past few years to the quality of this album. If anything at least check out "Love Language" and "African Dream" my two personal faves. Enjoy 
I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this cd yesterday, I read all the reviews and decided to check it out. I had never heard Talib Kweli before and I have just recently been getting into New York rap. I used to only listen to alot of Westcoast and Southside stuff like 2pac, Brotha Lynch, SPM, and Scarface. Up until yesterday my 3 favorite New York albums were: 1: Mobb Deep - The Infamous 2: Jay-Z - Reasonable Doubt 3: Nas - Illmatic They R now all moved down a notch!!! This album is now #1 Talib has a great mind and is an amazing writer, but to me the beats and production by Hi-Tek earn it the 5 stars. My favorite tracks are: The Blast, To Late, Memories Live, Africa Dream, Love Language, Touch You, and Good Mourning. To me these songs are all 10/10 If you like intelligent, quickstyled raps- CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM! But, like I said: The beats and production are worth the buy alone. Peace Out Muzic Lova 
I would argue that, overall, "Reflection Eternal/Train Of Thought" is the more interesting and consistently enjoyable album of his two classics. While "Quality" was also amazing, I'd prefer this to it. Talib is still a great MC, though he isn't my favorite - he's more of a great lyricist than a great MC. DJ Hi-Tek once again delivers high-quality production here - they somehow manage to be different yet somewhat familiar. I'm not really sure how to explain it - overall, however, this is a great album for clubs, the car or, basically, anywhere. The lyrics are as interesting as ever and definitely worthy of paying attention to, even if they're hard to hear at times (this is where Talib isn't my favorite). I don't know what else to say about it - if you're a rap fan then chances are you'll love this along with his follow-up "Quality". I'm not sure if non-rap fans will like this, though. All things aside, however, this is highly recommended! Highlights include: the entire album 
It's too bad that America's evils are eating away at itself. RAP Music brings a mirror to the world and shows you your reflection. Our culture as a nation and country is arrogant, egotistical, capitalistic and shameful. It's no wonder that RAP Music today lacks so much. BUT....THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS!!!!! That shows you there are intelligent people. That there is caring people. That we all arent caught up in vanity and commercialism. That alot of us arent mainstream, and that there is still great RAP music. This album is honest, conscience, lyrical, and of course DOPE! I was fortunate enough to grow up in an environment that RAP Music was more that what you listened to but what you lived. I grew up knowing RAP to stand for Rhythm And Poetry. It is so engulfing and powerfull that is highly suprising how wack it has become. But like I said THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS!!!! You wanna hear good beats...this is one of those albums! You wanna hear a lyrical emcee...this is one of those albums! You wanna hear music driven on substance instead of driven on revenue...this is one of those albums! Really..this is one of those albums you want. I'm happy that there is still RAP Music like this. When you hear it, you understand whay this music is so strong. You understand why the WOLRD emulates and creates it. You appreciate it. Go cop it, stop wasting time reading this. Go pump this in your system and listen. One 
Amazing, on the "paid in full" level. The tracks are fire, the rhymes, crazy!. Now this is truly a must. If you never heard this,well, your not really down with hiphop music, nor, do you really know much about our art form. In this day in time with all the trash on the air waves, and with hiphop at it's lowest creative point since it's inception, it's nothing short of a miracle this was even made. You can tell these brothers made this becuse of the love of hiphop, not cuse "it's a hustle" 
I am not shure if any of the reviewers here are reffering to this recording... This is not the "original" recording of In C - this is a performance od Shanghai Film ORchestra, adding another two "eastern" compositions to the CD. This performance is extraordinary, a flowing of soundscapes, real musical streams, In C sounds even more like some ethereal far-eastern music when played by all those chinese instruments and the other two compositions fit together with it perfectly. I think this is a really gorgeous contemporary music. 
Minimalism has produced five masterpieces: Philip Glass' "Music in Twelve Parts" and "Einstein on the Beach," La Monte Young's "The Well-Tuned Piano" (good luck finding that one!), Steve Reich's "Music for 18 Musicians," and Terry Riley's "In C." Although there are several recordings of "In C", each with a different orchestration, this one is probably still the best recording after all is said and done. (I only wish Mr. Riley would make a much longer recording, AT LEAST two hours long. 
In C is a launch pad for a group of students form New Yock and is composed by the great Terry Riley.For some reason this album is good to listen to on a rainy day,the clutter of insterments playing and interweaving the musical bits and pieces together is soothing to. Also good to fall asleep on. For the length of the album it never gets tirering and the funny thing is the c note on the piano begins,plays all the way though and ends the piece but the string is broken.I recommend this to anyone wanting something new to listen to. 
I enjoyed listening to this work quite often in college and still replay it in my mind at times. Get lost in your imagination and add your own playing if your mind can handle it 
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting...that's how this starts, with a drumming pulse on the top Cs on a piano. Then gradually, a whole tapestry of interlocking sounds starts to unfold, and you're slowly getting immersed in 'In C'. You don't really listen to this piece; the effect is much more like that aforementioned 'immersion', as the very gradual shifting of the patterns is more like organic growth, instead of the architectural jumps and skips found in Philip Glass or Steve Reich's works. How this is accomplished is by the use of a very selective variant on chance processes; since performers aren't given direct instructions on when to change from one ostinato to the next, this slow, 'oozing' shifting occurs, and it's quite fascinating (as opposed to what one reviewer here seems to think). It's certainly not an easy work to wrap your head around, unlike Glass, etc, but both the music and the ideas behind it are most rewarding. A critical work 
Okay, I thought the first OST was amazing so I assumed OST 2 would let me down. Boy was I wrong! Not only do you get full versions of Rise and Get 9, but you are also gifted with two tracks sung by Ilaria Graziano (I Can't Be Cool and I Do). But let me back up a bit. I knew I would love this OST more than the first one when I slipped it into the CD player in my car and Cyberbird almost ruptured my eardrums. Unbeknownst to me, the volume was up too high and I didn't turn it down until a cop looked at me funny. I think he liked what he heard but was afraid to admit it. There are seventeen tracks. Each one is different. From techno to electronica to jazz to pop to funk to a lovely ballad titled I Do. There's a little bit of everything, which is just the way I like my music. If you own Vol. 1 you should add this one to your collection. Amazon - Is there any chance you'll be selling Vol. 3? Pretty please? 
ï¿½ assolutamente incredibile come l'autore di questa colonna sonora sia riuscito a dare vita a generi cosï¿½ diversi l'uno dall'altro, in grado di emettere, ad ogni brano, sensazioni forti e ogni volta nuove. Molto interessante, come per il primo CD, che si sia fatto uso di non solo inglese, ma anche altre lingue, ognuna in grado di dare un timbro del tutto particolare ad ogni pezzo. Degno di nota e del tutto inaspettato il risultato ottenuto con la miscela di italiano ed inglese di "I can't be cool". Un solo giudizio: da comprare subito, sia per gli amanti delle colonne sonore che non 
I shall be brief with this review of mine. While I thought that the first Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. could not be `beaten' easily by another soundtrack; well, I dare to say that this one most probably is even better than the first one. As for you who might not be aware of the composer, her name is Yoko Kanno and she combines all sorts of music from classical, rock, cyber, drums up to heavy metal etc. bringing forth a very special kind of music. Moreover, by looking at this CD you are respectively familiar with anime shows. Why am I saying this? Simply, because amongst others, she also composed the music of Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, participated in the music of Escaflowne, Macross, `Please safe my earth' etc. (I am referring to anime shows so that the people who read this review can get a picture of her music). I hope that I could help you... 
In Vol. 2 we get more of the same from Yoko Kanno which is a good thing. 17 tracks from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex, 2nd Gig. Among those tracks are extended versions of Get 9 and Rise, which really gets the heart pumping and the spirit moving. Any fan of Yoko Kanno or any fan of Ghost In The Shell or any fan of anime in general needs to grab this CD, new or used 
The songs for this CD are wonderful, whether or not you like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. This really appeals to English fans of the series. With a third of the songs in English, this really made me happy. And every song you will hear in the series. Every song complements the series. I love this CD 
This is an awesome sound track. Most of the songs are really good, and I'm a person who doesn't like sound tracks. I love the Ghost In The Shell franchise, but this music can stand on it's own. The composer, Yoko Kanno, effectively creates a variety of sounds that have real dimension. What I mean by that is the music doesn't just set a mood, but it fills a space. Listen to the first track ("Cyberbird"), and you'll understand. Some of the tracks with singing are not in Japanese or English, I think they're in Italian. The female vocalist on this album is Ilaria Graziano, and her voice is angelic. Her performance in "I DO" makes you feel sad and happy at the same time...Granted, there are a couple of tracks on this album that do sound like they come from an Anime Tv series, (kind of Japanese Pop style), but they're still fairly enjoyable... Most of the songs are very emotional and have a subtle power to them. While listening, you'll feel chills on more than one occasion... Since owning this album, I've found myself searching out more music composed by Kanno and more performances by Graziano. I'm a fan of them both now 
If you like the music from Cowboy Bebop and/or other stuff Yoko Kano has done then you'll like this CD.You will hear the songs in the tv show.The opening song of the show Rise and the ending song Living inside the shell,you get to hear the full length version of both.After listening to this CD and as you watch the GITS you'll reconize the songs.It's a good CD for GITS fans 
I would say that the compositions for GitS:SAC 2nd Gig are even stronger than those of the first season. The frantic, desperate pace of Rise fortells of the darker themes of this season, while I Can't Be Cool is just haunting. The only thing I almost didn't like was go Da Da, but the jaring opening fits with the character it themes. My only question is, who was What's it For written about? The Major, or... Watch, you'll see. 
This CD really, honestly, blew me away. I am very impressed with all of the tracks, including cyberbird and the 2nd gig opening, which, I feel, is a big improvement over the original. If you're contemplating a purchase, I strongly suggest it. It feels more like a full-featured album rather than a mere OST. All the tracks are done in a variety of languages, as well. It incorporates symphonic values, rock, industrial, and upbeat jazz influences. It's like a burst of melodic, rythmic, multi-genre flavor. I haven't purchased such a stimulating and fun to listen to album in a while. This was definitely worth its weight in gold. Yokko Kanno's brilliance shines through this encompassing, imersive masterpiece of a soundtrack 
I was so happy when I purchased this second OST, which seems like it is geared more for Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig than the first season. Fans of Yoko Kanno will NOT be disappointed as this soundtrack features the composer doing the things she does best, making cool grooves. That said, you won't hear any unique branching out of styles as you have probably become accustomed in her other works. This OST seems very derivative of work you have already heard from Yoko Kanno, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing for those of us who love her music. On this OST you can expect to hear songs that sound like a mix of what you heard in the first GITS: SAC OST, as well as a few of the Cowboy Bebop OSTs (cuts 3,4, and 6 in particular). Track 11, "What's it For?" and track 13, "Pet Food" even bear a resemblance to music from the Wolf's Rain OST 1. Also, if you play this CD on your computer, don't be surprised when you realize that several of the track titles come up written in Japanese. Also, all of the performers are listed as Yoko Kanno (despite the vocals being done by others) and her name is always written in Japanese. This isn't a biggie, though, since all the titles and names are written in English in the liner book. Overall, I'm glad I bought this, and I will probably enjoy it until GITS: SAC 2nd Gig is shown on Adult Swim starting in November 
I bought his first CD it was ok but with this one I loved it! Lyfe has that that scratchy voice, it just sound so sexy. I give this CD a five star because the songs are great 
I am in "awe"! This artist is likened to a "street poet", he captures the essence of urban life in his music. It's great having an artist sing of the life we live as opposed to "talking" it, and so vividly depicting the major aspects 
I just loved this album the songs really related to my life. It was nice to see that there was personal experience involved while writing the songs 
This CD is great it doesn t top the 1st one but it is fye.. 
I am in love with this Cd I cant stop listening to it. This was a excellent cd. I can listen to all of the songs. The interludes are ok which at first I thought was stupid but it ran smoothly into the music. Everyone get this cd I guarentee that u will love this cd. 
FANLYFE Lyfe, 268-192 was stunning. Phoenix is only a mixed blessing. S.E.X, Goodbye, River are vintage Lyfe. You spoiled "Still Here" and "Slow Down" by references to women as bitch and the use of the "nigga" word. Otherwise these are two lyrically powerful songs. Lyfe, since you claim to be in metaphysics you must know the power of "words." We have to stop perpetuating these words among our people. We can talk of our pain and even what makes one a thug without the use of these words. If anybody can do it, you can Lyfe. Do not settle for cheap commercialism. Don't forget also that black women are your largestfanbase. I expect more from Lyfe only because he is so good. Still a good CD. Still love my Lyfe! 
Loved the 1st CD and wasn't sure if i'd like the 2nd but I do! Great job Lyfe. I recommend adding this CD to u'r collection, all of the songs are good! 
Unlike many of today's artist, Lyfe has managed to keep his hip hop edge while displaying his musical talents in an uplifting voice. Columbia/Sony could have done a better job of promoting this CD. This CD had been released 3 1/2 weeks before I discovered it. I usually purchase CDs the same day they are released. I am one of those people who purchases new music every TUESDAY. Back to Lyfe, this is a wonderful CD. I hope Lyfe receives his share of accolades (Grammies, Soul Train, NAACP, and AMAs). Lyfe's music is a reflection of his social consciousness. His music will only get better as he continues to live LIFE. Is it possible we have been blessed with a young Marvin Gaye? Favorite Songs I`ll Always Love You Still Here Keep Ya Head Up (nice tribute to Tupac) Radio Let's Stay Together Stingy S.E.X. Goodbye 
Lyfe Jennings has got to be pinching himself right now because he's literally on top of the world. Girls are screaming at his jam-packed concerts, the brothers are showing him love for keeping it real, and his label has to be satisfied with their decision to take a chance on Lyfe and his music. After doing a bid and pouring his heart out for his monstrous debut Lyfe 268-192, the soul survivor gives his next chapter with his latest release The Phoenix. The biggest difference between his first cd and The Phoenix has to be the fact that the interludes are separate tracks instead of slapping them at the end of each song. This is great for people who make their own mixes and don't want to struggle with an odd transition in their personal mix cds. All technicalities aside, The Phoenix starts off with the so-so track "Slow Down" with Young Buck. He then explodes into "Goodbye," a monster ballad that is arguably his most heartfelt song to date. "Let's Stay Together" is a good 'I'm sorry' song for those instant requests hours on late night radio when you want to smooth things over. "Biggie N!gga" is probably his most comical just from the title alone, while "Ghetto Superman" describes how Lyfe feels about being looked up to by everybody around him. His first single "S.E.X." is a song that all these growing ladies out here need to hear. "Down Here, Up There" is a simple acoustic song about dealing with the struggles on Earth to keep from going up to Heaven before your time. The old school feel of the music on "The River" helps with conveying Lyfe's message of giving your life over to God. "Still Here" is another okay track, with help from Three Six Mafia and Project Pat. "More Than A Girl" tells about the importance of a woman in general, while "Stingy" is Lyfe's song about having a close bond with the one you love. "Radio" just talks about the power of hearing your favorite songs on the radio and putting aside the troubles of your life. His interesting take of 2pac's "Keep Ya Head Up" is not your everyday cover considering he harmonizes the verses and incorporates a group of kids for part of the song. He closes out the album with a bonus track called "I'll Always Love You" that is worthy of being a radio single in the future. Even though it's not as strong as his first album, The Phoenix proves that Lyfe Jennings has the skills to be a long-lasting artist in this business. There's no sophomore jinx here, that's for sure. 
What can I say. I've been a Cheap Trick fan for longer than most fans out there. This Rockford, Illinois band has been rockin' forever. These are good tracks. I like the other 'greatest hits' too though. Put the best of the 2 together, and you have the best of the best. Southern Girls is one of my all time favorites 
CHEAP TRICK: AUTHORIZED GREATEST HITS: Cheap Trick successfully mixed a Beatle-esque power pop sensibility with crunchy guitar riffs, its tongue planted a mile in its cheek. Two guys that LOOKED like pin-up boy rock stars, and two that looked more like a Bowery Boy and a used car salesman respectively, the Tricksters managed a handful of radio-ready diehards in SURRENDER (complete with klassic Kiss reference), the LIVE AT BUDOKAN rave-up I WANT YOU TO WANT ME, and, much later, ballad biggie THE FLAME. This overview also trots out slick staples such as a rowdy rendition of Fats Domino's AIN'T THAT A SHAME (though, strangely, not their percussive treatment of Elvis' DON'T BE CRUEL, nor their Fab Four clone cover of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR), bouncy shoulda-been-a-hit SOUTHERN GIRLS, and the theme to THAT 70'S SHOW (THAT 70'S SONG). As with any compilation, certain worthy tracks ('ELLO KIDDIES, VOICES, CALIFORNIA MAN) are missing in action, but this is due more to the boys' wealth of decent material than to careless selection. All in all, a pretty neat trick. FIVE GUITAR NECKS 
Cheap Trick's Authorized Greatest Hits is an improvement over the earlier greatest hits album from the 90s. First of all the Authorized Greatest Hits contains more songs than the earlier hits complation. Second, Cheap Trick themselves, were involved in the compling of this collection. If a single disc, is all the Cheap Trick that you are looking for I recommend this over the other greatest hits. Really, Authorized Greatest Hits will probably please fans, who do not want to buy the individual albums, but like all hits collections there are always a couple of personal favorites missing. I think "Hot Love" from their first album should've been on here. Also, there is a live version of "The Flame" in place of the studio version, but still if you're looking for a single disc of Cheap Trick to add to your collection this is a good choice. Hits include: Southern Girls, I Want You to Want Me, Surrender, The 70's Song, etc, very good stuff. A good cd to listen to in the car 
Cheap Trick always seemed like three bands rolled up into one, and most of their career has been spent trying to find a balance between the different styles. You have your Beatlesque power pop tunes, which brought the band deserved hits in the 70's and a place in the heart of indie rockers from Nirvana to Guided by Voices. You have the 80's AOR years, filled with ballads that are musically pleasing with great choruses but artistically less interesting, and often heavily produced. And finally, you have the side of the band that was capable of cranking out menacing rockers with dark lyrics such as "Auf Wiedersehen" and "I'm Not The Only Boy". While the third side of Cheap Trick is pretty much ignored here, the first two are covered pretty well. The first single-disc greatest hits album Cheap Trick released REALLY ignored the early years, but this one takes a few steps to rectify that problem. Here you get "Southern Girls" in all of its power pop glory, as well as the quirky "Stop This Game" and gorgeous "Mandocello". You also get later years gems like "That 70's Song" (nothing special, but a fun Big Star semi-cover). All of the big hits are here, including the two songs that guaranteed Cheap Trick their place in the classic rock pantheon - "Surrender" and "I Want You To Want Me". And don't forget the fact that the band is really tight - Robin Zander is one of the top vocalists of all time, and we have Tom Petersson to thank for the 12-string bass. If you're looking for a disc that captures Cheap Trick as you heard them on the radio, this is a good single-disc encapsulation of their biggest hits. But if you really want to find out what Cheap Trick was all about, and still get most of their big hits, splurge for all five of their first records - Cheap Trick (self-titled), In Color, Heaven Tonight, At Budokan, and Dream Police. While Dream Police is the weakest of the bunch, all of these albums are absolute classics and really cover ALL sides of Cheap Trick - one of the most misunderstood bands of all time 
Now if you ask me, and many 70s musical fans do now and again, Cheap Trick is quite possibly the ultimate 70s band composed of Caucasian males. I can't say they are the best band of the 70s flat out, but they might be the best one composed of Caucasian males. Their music is not timeless, but it was timely and it captured what that decade really was - a bridge betwixt the heady days of the 1960s and the corporate society of the 1980s. Cheap Trick kind of connected the two unrelated sides and managed to come out smelling like a sweaty rose. This here collection is a slice of their best stuff and a few live versions thrown in for good measure. As I am not a die-hard fan, some of these cuts were new to me... and I must confess that I liked them enough to keep right on tapping my toes as I heard them for the first time. I know a lot of folk will complain that there are things wrong with this here CD... like certain tracks were omitted and thus the product is less than it might could have been, or that certain tracks were included and it diminished the cultural impact of the overall collection... to them I have only one thing to say... "hush up." This CD is great... even better than great... it's splendiferous. Mama likes to have it on when she's in the kitchen fixin' up vittles for me and the youngin's, and Bernice (that's Betty Mae's cousin who's staying with us until she and Lester work things out) claims this CD helps her relax after a hard day out in the cabbage patch 
If The Cars, The Knack, Bazooka Jones and The Romantics are princes of power pop, then Cheap Trick are the Kings. This is a great 'sampler' of some of their most popular tracks. I would have preferred the studio version of "The Flame". but this rare live offering is a nice variation. If you don't have any Cheap Trick (why, you wouldn't I don't know) then this would be a good segway into one of the greatest powerpop bands of all time 
"Cheap Trick" seems like one of those bands like "The Cars" that doesn't get much credit, but are totally awesome! This basically is a great collection. The big hits "I Want You to Want me", "Dream Police", and "Surrender", along side favorites like "Tonight it's You" and "Southern Girls". PLUS a live version of "The Flame" and the theme song from "That 70's Show". Even though others don't like "Mandocello", I really like it. Being a child of the 80's, I would have liked "Ghost Town" on here, but at least it doesn't have "Magical Mystery Tour" like the other collection does. Overall a great cd, and not getting it right now would be "cheap" 
It pretty much stands to reason that most everyone is going to find faults with ANY Greatest Hits package. For everyone complaining about missing tracks, I offer this solution: Get a copy of this AND a copy of "The Greatest Hits"... sure there is some overlap, but the tracks that DON'T overlap cover pretty much everything you would treasure by this cool band, and ultimately both collections compliment each other nicely. Big pluses for this CD include "Stop This Game" (from the ALL SHOOK UP album), "Everything Works If You Let It" (from the ROADIE motion picture and soundtrack) and "That 70s Song" (from one of the coolest shows on TV today... I swear I actually went to high school with those people!!!). Anyway if you're not ready to dive into the box set, I would highly recommend having "The Authorized Greatest Hits" and "The Greatest Hits" CDs side-by-side in your collection 
Not many bands can bridge the gap between rock and electronic. And even fewer seem able to bridge the gap between rock and industrial. The two have faced off at each other for years. There are obvious comparisons to Nine Inch Nails. But Kidney Theives are not trying to be NIN. They have their own difinitive sound, Female vocals, and, in my opinion, a sharper, clearer image of whatever they are focused on. They paint a clearer picture of what they are singing about. I am shocked that this band is not getting more attention. 
With all the noise pollution going on these days its nice to pop Zerospace in the old CD payer now and again just to remember how good music can be. Buy this now. No seriously, buy it. It's like NIN without the irritation factor 
Unlike a lot of modern music, the vocals on this aren't that terrible screaming/growling metal nonsense. This CD is the best elements of NIN, and Garbage (before they sucked) combined. As much as I like both these bands, I really think the kidney thieves excel both. If this CD was released in the mid-late 90s, it would have went platinum. Now, everyone listens to screamo, emo and Disney "actresses." 
I first heard this band on Much Music (now known as Fuse). They blew my socks off. I had a radio show at the time and I wanted to know more about them. I called up their record label and he gave me tickets to see them along with Tommy Lee. He also set me up with an interview with them. They were awesome. I took pictures and everything. About the band: If you didnt know already, they arent a band anymore. The lead singer is off doing a solo project. They didnt get much press but they are awesome. I listen to this CD a lot. My fiancee is bored with them by the 400th time she heard me listening to the CD. It has everything. Its like garage roc 
- as noted in the next interview - but now, thanks to the 'net and us Amazon reviewers, they don't need press - right 
I had never heard of this band for a long time until a friend gave me this cd to listen to, and I immediately loved it. I know the cover almost makes it look like this is something that freaky goth girl you know who lives in her drunken boyfriend's car listens to when she's depressed, but don't judge it like I just did. This cd is fantastic! The music is great for fans of hard/goth/yet-not-so-hard rock. Kidneythieves' music has a beautifully atmospheric and unique quality to it, which makes your listening experience a great one. Free's got a great voice that stands out over most other bands in this genre, and practically every track on here is worth it. Highlights include "Placebo", "Zerospace" and "Crazy", among others. (The last track has about 10 minutes of silence then a little vocal outro, but wait for it or play it on your computer to fast forward to it) 
I bought this album after reading all the great reviews, having followed links from similar music. This is about as boring a disc as i've ever heard, and definitely doesn't meet my expectations for this genre. get Luxt's Chromasex Monkeydrive or something from Assemblage 23 instead 
I picked this cd up after I saw so many people referencing it in reviews. When I bought it I wasn't expecting much, I knew there would be maybe one or two songs I would really enjoy (as it is with all my cds). But what I got was a much needed treat, every song has it's own touch of perfection. I must admit though, I do enjoy the instrumentals, but with Free's beautifully tragic voice I don't understand why you would use filler. 'Molten' however, sets up 'Black Bullet' wonderfully. That is one of those introductions you want to listen to just to pump yourself up for one of the most pulse pounding anthems on this cd. While I did enjoy every song on this cd, the standouts are 'Zerospace', 'Black Bullet', 'Dyskrasia', 'Glitter Girl', and 'Placebo'. I realize this is almost half the cd, but when I listen to this cd, I always make time to hear those five songs. I can't tell you what this cd sounds similar to because it's so unlike anything I've heard recently. I recommend this cd to everybody, kidneythieves certainly deserve more fame than what they have 
I stumbled across this album in accident one night when i was watching Queen of the danmed, and believe me when i say im glad i did 'cos Kidneythieves are the most unique and fresh band your likely to ever listen to. their industrial rock/techno sound coupled with Free Dominguez's beautiful/haunting voice played through headphones (best method when listening to any Kidneythieves Album Due to the heavy stereo effects which sound amazing)cant be beaten by any current Rock/whatever genre you listen to Band 
You may have been introduced to KT through the movie Queen of the Damned, the award winning Deus Ex Invisible War game, or just wandered into this review, but rest assured your ears will be tapping on your brain pan asking for some more of that dreamy, industrial grit only KT can give. Starting off, it wouldn't be fair to be so over-zealous and say this CD is 'totally cool and awesome' like so many other emotional and non-technical reviews here. The Zerospace CD deserves 4 stars mainly because the sound is truly unique. It's sort of like industrial with a splash of techno all wrapped in a post nuclear, dark metal sphere. There are only 5 out of 13 songs that are any good. They are: Black Bullet, Before I'm Dead, Dyskrasia, Glitter Girl and Zerospace. While these are still good credits to the band, there are a few technical issues with some of the songs. First, in examining the good songs, I would have been much better if the lead vocal, Dominguez, had not interrupted the pace and tempo of the two songs: Black Bullet and ZeroSpace. What she does is, a few times in both songs, she slows the song down almost to a stop, to do the whole "Whisper for effect" sequence like so many try to do now. This is done to add some shock-drama to the song, but Dominguez doesn't do it very well, and the tempo and speed of the songs themselves don't need it. The tempo and pace of Glitter Girl is a good model that Domiguez should pay attention to in the future, as the tempo and speed fit the character of the song. The songs: Amnzero and Taking a Train are barley songs at all. They represent shots at techno-dream abstraction and are really poor songs technically; they should have been axed from the CD. For example, Taking a Train is nothing but long silence and the same repeated whisper lyrics ...really boring and irritating. The rest of the songs on the CD are just Ok, and seem to be in a different mindset to the 5 other good ones. Overall, the CD is worth the buy and well-earned band support; and you get 5 great songs rather than only one decent song, like so many new CDs today (damn, greedy record companies will sign anybody to make a buck). If you like dark, dreamy, distorted metal, you will really enjoy Kidney Thieves. It will surely give your soul something dark, metallic, and gritty to chew on 
Dick's Pick 24, as the last cd of the new batch of DP's released to stores, ends the set on a high quality note. Even though this installment of the Dick's Pick's series is only two discs, these two discs are jam packed with excellent music. The whole first disc flows along nicely, with excellent versions of "Beat It Down The Line", "US Blues", and the closing "Weather Report Suite". The sound quality, even though this show was used to test out the new extravangant PA sound system, is on par with most of the rest of the DP series, and definately better than a few of the prior picks. Also, it is a nice change of pace to see "Scarlet Begonias" seperated from "Fire On The Mountain", and it sounds excellent here. Disc 2 is the real treat for this concert. The long jam of PITB - UJB - MD - UJB - PITB is superb, and one of the most unique in the Dick's Picks series. The set ends with a mediocre Wharf Rat and Sugar Magnolia, but by that time The Dead have taken you for quite a nice ride. This isn't one of the most legendary DP's, but out of the new six, I'd only rate DP 19 higher. Overall, an excellent listen.

I have to disagree with several issues raised in the first review. I got this Pick about two years ago, and at first I didn't take to it. The first reason was the sound; at the time I didn't know much about the Wall of Sound (the pictures in the booklet give you some idea about the system's dimensions). I agree with the first review that the sound board recordings off the Wall of Sound can be treble heavy, light on bass, and with compressed sounding vocals. Yet, for this Pick, the sound wizards who put the Picks together have worked their magic and produced a beautiful, rich sounding '74 show (the vocals still sound a bit compressed, but hey, this is a Dick's Pick). The second reason I didn't take to this Pick immediately was that I wasn't familiar with the 1974 version of the Dead. By this point the band had developed a free jazz style to their jamming and were less obviously blues or rock orientated. A lot of the songs the Dead were writing around the early '70s had a leisurely tempo to them. With some of their songs (such as Bertha), they had slowed the tempo down revealing different aspects of the songs. However, I am not saying that the tempo to the Pick is sluggish! This Pick represents a muscular and powerful show. The first CD is fantastic; it contains one of my favourite versions of Brown-eyed Women, the first performances of Scarlet Begonias and Cassidy, and a blistering Deal. The China Cat&gt;I know you rider is a bit sedated, but it is followed by a beautiful Weather Report Suite. The second CD contains one of, I believe, only three versions of the Playing&gt;Uncle John's&gt;Morning Dew&gt;Uncle John's&gt;Playing sandwich/grouping. It is as fantastic a demonstration of the improvisational skills of the Dead as ever you'll find. Unlike the first reviewer, I think the Morning Dew floats along at a nice pace, Garcia taking his time and allowing the others to do their stuff. When I first heard this, I didn't fully understand what they had done, but give it a few listens, and you will be carried away with the music. Overall, I think the Pick is one of the best that I have heard and I would highly recommend it. And, as this is only a composite of the full show they played that night, it makes me wonder about all they left off! It could easily have been a 3 CD Pick! 
Disc One: U.S. Blues (6:16), Promised Land (4:04), Brown-Eyed Woman (5:27), Black-Throated Wind (7:05), Scarlet Begonias (7:13), Beat It On Down The Line (3:46), Deal (5:29), Cassidy (4:09), China Cat Sunflower (8:41), I Know You Rider (6:02), Weather Report Suite (15:35) Prelude (1:25) Part I (4:23) Part II - Let It Grow (9:46) Disc Two: Playing In The Band (14:11), Uncle John's Band (9:16), Morning Dew (12:31), Uncle John's Band (6:27), Playing In The Band (4:11), Big River (5:54), Bertha (6:35), Wharf Rat (9:29), Sugar Magnolia (8:57) Okay, 2.5 stars. This Pick took me quite a while to get into but there is some nice stuff in places here. Is this the best '74 you've ever heard? No, but if you own most or all of the Dick's Picks you already own some worse Picks than this one. I know this is never the popular view, but during the times where this Pick suffers, it's because of Garcia. There are some stretches here where he just doesn't have any interesting or emotionally engaging ideas. His playing is atrocious for most of this Morning Dew. Phil is dropping some thunder on this version but Jerry plays very badly almost the whole time. Jerry had a bunch of amazing nights in '74, but aside from a few tunes here, this isn't one of his better performances, which is pretty depressing actually, as Phil and Billy in particular are doing their thing here. It would have been nice if Jerry had been playing off of them better on this night. To be fair though, on the highlights of this set (Let It Grow, the first Playing In the Band, and the minor rhythm jam segment of Uncle John's Band) Jerry does contribute nicely to the festivities. This Let It Grow is certainly no 6/18/74 but it's still a nice one that I'm sure was loved by everyone in attendance. It's my favorite track of this Pick. All in all, I would say this was a mediocre performance with some very bad moments and some nice moments, though still there is nothing here that elevates it to the level of any of the phenomenal performances from May and June of 1974. The sound is good. Everyone is quite present in the mix, though there is a bit of a sterile feel to it. This is not an essential Grateful Dead purchase, especially given how absolutely brilliantly the entire band plays on Dick's Picks 23 (9/17/72), and how great that Pick sounds. 
You will learn and sing the songs that are on this record,BUY IT 
Let us not forget this cd for too long. These really are songs to learn and sing! Deep vocals of Ian McCullough are strong and the lyrics are catchy such as Do It Clean which is still playing in my mind. 
Echo The Bunnymen is most well-known for their 80's hit "The Killing Moon" (which was featured in the cult hit movie "Donnie Darko"). While this is a great song, the rest on here just aren't as good. Echo The Bunnymen are clearly pretty talented, but the singer and the lyrics just aren't that good or interesting most of the time. None of the songs are bad here, thankfully, but they're not great either - they're all indeed catchy, however. Musically it's pretty standard 80's indie/pop rock, as there's little innovation to be found here. If you're an Echo The Bunnymen fan then this is the collection to get, but if you're looking for great songs you won't really find them here. I would argue that "The Killing Moon" alone bumps this up to a "4" from a "3.5". This is merely a "good" (arguably decent) CD. Slightly recommended. Highlights include: "The Killing Moon" the rest are good or decent 
Well, you've heard a million times the clich "still sounds fresh today," and I'm here to tell you that this hackneyed saying is absolutely true when it comes to this CD. When I was mostly unfamiliar with punk music I associated the best of it with the otherworldly sound of the introduction to "The Cutter." Later, after listening to the album extensively, I realized that "Bring on the Dancing Horses" was the worst of the eleven tracks (which is really saying something). It did not take long before they became, like the Smiths, personal favorites. Echo was one of the most original sounding bands of the eighties with talent to burn. They featured the type of complexity that made it tough on critics to reduce that wonderful decade into a stew of big hair, kitsch, and campy lyrics. This is about as passionate a band as there has ever been, and when I play "Songs..." I do not jump about. I let it wind through and imbibe its beauty and perfection 
ian mcculloch and co. practically invented the british guitar rock later adopted by the likes of the smiths, the stone rose, et. al. more melodic and accessible than the likes of joy division, echo and the bunnymen straddled the line between exquisite song crafting and experimentation. ian mcculloch proved to be the perfect frontman -- the trademark haircut, the trenchcoat, the voice that threated to crack at any second, the enigmatic persona. while not a truly gifted vocalist, he never had to be. his raspy voice is ideally suited to the music. much of the bunnymen's charm lay in their working class roots, settling for less than perfect, slightly gritty production and focusing instead on quality beats and melodies. will sargeant single-handedly ushered in a new guitar movement. his playing was sometimes intrusive in the beginning, but always interesting melodically and sonically as he matured. (and coldplay oughta be paying him royalties for the riffs they've nicked from him.) add to that a more than capable rhythm section (r.i.p., pete), and the bunnymen became one of the most influential rock bands of the last 25 years. some of the finest bunnymen songs are found here: the oft mentioned 'the killing moon,' 'never stop,' 'the cutter,' 'the rescue,' etc. even now (2005), they sound fresh. every time i play this cd in my car or at home, i'm blown away by how utterly *fantastic* a band they really are--inventive, unique, and ridiculously original; excellent arrangements, flawless melodies, superb musicianship. of course, it always helps to have ian broudie doing the knob-twiddling. this collection is something of 'greatest hits' that chronicles one of the most important 'post-punk' bands to ever come out of the UK. a must have for any music afficionado 
I remember when I heard their song "Killing Moon" from Donnie Darko, I fell in love with it right away. I love all their songs, this would have to be their best album to me. The lyrics are breathtaken and amazing yet so beautiful. Its a must have album or a must listen to band 
I first heard this band when they appeared on the soundtrack to Urgh! A Music War when they did The Puppet. Ever since then I was hooked on them and this album totally epitomizes everything about them. Great lyrics, catchy guitar riffs and Ian McCulloch's vocals are extremely mesmerizing! Definitely worth the pickup especially on tracks The Puppet, A Promise, The Cutter and Killing Moon...definitely a great CD to have in your rotation 
This is pretty much what the casual fan is looking for. It's a collection of their early 80's songs, and includes the hit Bring On The Dancing Horses, from the Pretty In Pink soundtrack. Other great songs are Rescue, Cutter, and the great Killing Moon. The only big thing missing is Lips Like Sugar, which was released afterwards. Otherwise this is a nice simple collection. It will go great with your Cure and Joy Division cd's. They do have an 18 track import collection. Ian McCulloch's solo stuff is good too, especially Candleland 
I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record. Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort. 
Antony was the only one I loved--okay Rufus was fine too-- in that horrible documentary on Leonard Cohen. So I went out and got this album. You really can play leave this CD in your machine and play it over and over and over 
Wherever he came from - and it seems unlikely he is an earthling - Antony is like a fallen angel whose twisted poetry and bittersweet ideas shock and delight. He divides people - love him or don't get him - if you love him: lucky you. He is worth opening ears and heart to - magic stuff 
I should start by saying I'm usually not a fan of music that's this theatrical. But Antony's voice is one of the most gorgeous and powerful instruments I've ever heard, and paired with the lyrics on this album, one imagines him as a mournful angel trapped halfway between heaven and hell. I've had this for several months, and I still listen to it almost daily. It's stunning, and I can't recommend it highly enough. A side note: I saw Antony perform in San Francisco and was surprisingly unimpressed. He played some songs that just weren't my taste at all, and his vocal delivery was a bit weird. In fact, he was outperformed by CocoRosie (whose albums are wonderful as well, by the way). But I remain a huge fan of Antony's, and I can't wait to hear what he and the Johnsons release next 
A good friend turned us on to Antony and after spending many years in New York listening to great drag acts like Kiki and Herb, my friend's description recalled this genre. But he was off in a big way. There is NOTHING kitsch about Antony (and the Johnsons). Try to imagine a voice that is the complete merging of Little Jimmy Scott and Nina Simone. Impossible, you say? You would be wrong. A great jazz legend, I can't remember who, once said that if God had a voice, it would sound like Little Jimmy Scott. She was wrong - God would sound exactly like Antony. Vocals that evoke the most intimate hurts, nostalgic moments that ended epochs of your life, dreams that eluded you, desires that trickled off your fingertips before you could close your hand. This is the voice of Antony. And so much more. I am still discovering this brilliant artist. After Elliott Smith died, I pretty much stopped listening to anything. I was devastated - any Elliott Smith fan can understand that his death dealt a deep cut into us. Until I found Antony I hadn't found anything as profoundly moving since. I am so greatful for him and his lion-hearted voice. 
if you ask people what they think of this album the initial general response is i love it or hate it. but one thing no one can disagree with is his voice is like nothing you have heard before. when i first heard 'you are my sister' i fell in love and the more i listen to it the more i love it. so i brought both albums and my admiration and love for his voice and lyrics grew. its one of those rare finds that make you wont to introduce him to everyone you know but in doing so ive found you have to be patient... i showed my boyfriend and his first response was "does it get any better!" he hated it. but after hours of playing the album he grew to love it and i even saw a tear whilst playin 'hope theres someone' which struck him so deeply hes demanded this song at his funeral if anything should happen. ive also played it to 3 friends and my mum and all had the same response at first but now they cant stop talking about it. so upon listening if your first thoughts are 'i cant listen to his voice' or you think the lyrics are a little unsettling and controversial, give it a chance listen to each song once or twice and if you dont grow to love it youll definately respect it 
Fantastic! "The Cripple and The Starfish" and "River of Sorrow" are two great tracks. Antony's voice is gold 
If you read the reviews of any of Antony's albums and EPs, here or the UK site, you may find that being rendered speechless after listening to his music is mentioned frequently. I consider this not only accurate but also likely to happen to anyone who may listen to this, his debut, album or its follow-up, the Mercury Prize winner "I Am A Bird Now." It has been a long time since a singer or songwriter -Antony is both- has moved me so deeply with the dramatic range of his voice, the enveloping depth of his melodies or the courage of his words. Just consider "Cripple And The Starfish" and "Hitler In My Heart," the second and third cuts, that -particularly if listened together- will absolutely floor you with the tender courage of their lyrics and the glorious beauty of Antony's voice. For those who may not know his work, I may not be able to offer the kind of references that can serve them well. In term of genre, you can't call it Pop or Alternative, for instance, and expect to have a reliable idea of what you'll hear. If I have to put a style label to this music I'd have to coin a new one, "Alterative," because that's exactly what it might do to you: alter you. Finally, since I haven't mentioned them yet, a word about The Johnsons. Their sound -almost a chamber ensemble, with the addition of drums and bass- is particularly suited for this music and exquisitely performed. "Divine," a beautiful tribute to the star of many John Waters films, "Twilight" and "The Atrocities" are another three great examples of the band's gift for accompanying Antony. Although, to my taste, I Am A Bird Now of some songs in the recent EPs (I've reviewed them too, in their pages- may be even more mature statements, this album must be given your full attention. This is a solid five-star album and the first powerful document of an amazing new voice 
Absolutely incredible CD! Antony has the most beautiful, haunting voice that I've heard in a decade. He's been compared to many artists, but is truly in a class of his own. For the people who claim that there are no longer any truly unique talents, Antony and the Johnsons have arrived. It's impossible to put this music in any catagory, but, if you like moody, soulful vocals and lyrics that are equally hopeful and depressing, this is the one for you 
"I didn't know what had been missing from my life 'til i heard Antony The Johnsons". Both this album and 'I am a bird now' are beautiful and tragic records. This is a very moving album without ever getting depressing. I can hear alot of Bryan Ferry (circa Avalon) and Marc Almond in it. It's easy to picture it being sung by Antony under a bright white spotlight, center stage, in a smokey underground bar in Berlin in the 30's. Roses being thrown, tears being cried, all to rapturous applause.. 
This album is a classic in my opinion. Every song is good on it. I highly recommend this and all of dead prez's other albums 
Their first album "Let's Get Free" was a 5 star masterpiece, unfortunately this one is horrible. There are only 2 good tracks on this album, both which are deep and reminiscent of "Let's Get Free." One is "Sellin D.O.P.E." and the other is "Look Around" which is already featured on Beatnuts' "Musical Massacre," and to make things worse they chop off 3 minutes of the song. The other tracks are boring and uninspiring. They completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop. The beats are either recycled or "snare- happy, throw them bows" type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first CD. It's much like a book with no pages. Shine with no substance. It's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots. I'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old Dead Prez formula that made "Let's Get Free" so great. But until then, don't pick this one up 
and just put the cd in and let your ears be blessed with hip hop the way it's supppposed to be done 
Every verse that Dead Prez spits is just adding to where hip-hop should be going. I don't agree with everything these guys say but they know how to state what they think is right.They don't come off as those [individuals] who stand on the block and kick knowledge but don't do nothing all day.They come off as proud black men with flaws trying to teach.The reason that they change up their beats is becasue everyone is not from New York. DP is big in the south.They want to be able to get their message out there.So don't hate because you don't like the beat.If anyone gets the album,remember that they live this. They just got arrestted for being black outside.Know your enemy.R.B.G for life 
I am a huge DP fan and this album did not disappoint....Let's be free was to put them out there and educate.....this album was more of a rally for a revolution....it was innovative for DP ...they used the knowledge of how brainwashed the music consumers are by beats but BS lyrics that's why DP recycled some beats and it made the whole album flow together......My favorites are "It's War", "It was Written"(which is for the reggae fans) and "Know your Enemy"....like I stated before for the TRUE DP fans out there,,,this album won't disappoint 
Heck I'm not sure really where to start. I came across this group like hundreds of thousands or millions of people had, You Tube. It was the Backyard Dancing and Treadmill Video. Both amazing when compared to the boring MTV crap. So then I visited the website and listed to some other songs. I bought the album and extremely happy I did. Every song rocks and pulls the listener in. Every song has it own flavor, its own lyric integrity and musical makeup. Its one of the best albums I've bought all year. It's been playing non stop in my car, at work and at home. I love this album. Can't believe it took me this long to find out about OK GO. I would give this album 6 out of 5. Its an enjoyable experience each time I listen. 
I had first heard of OK Go on VH1 when they were highlighting the "You should know" Bands. And there appeared OK GO. If you Haven't seen their music video for "Here it goes again" you have to! It's soooo AMAZING! But back to the music, this whole CD pretty much blew me away, because usually i'll buy a CD and the one song i've heard by them will be the only good song on the CD, however this is not the case with the album "OH NO" Each song is different from one another and they've got a good beat. There are fast head bopping songs and then slower mellower songs, but each type are great. OK GO is a really great band and i would suggest them to anyone. - Especially the poppy/altenative type- like myself 
It is very rare that I find an album that I can listen to every song over and over again. This is one of those rare albums for me. I love every song on Oh No. Whenever I have someone in my car and I have OK Go playing, they always become interested in the songs ask me who the band is. Whether you want a rockin' song like "Invincible" or a ballad like "Oh Lately it's so Quiet," this album has something for everyone. I strongly recommend this album to everyone. You won't be disappointed! (By JC member: Shanna9 
Let me get straight to the point: OK GO's Oh No is the best album I have ever owned in my life. Yes, this is a very bold statement, and no, this isn't the only album I've ever bought, but after listening to the album about 50+ times, I still stand by this claim. I first heard about this album and band from the game "SSX On Tour", in which the track "Here it Goes Again" was featured. Although not impressed by this track alone, as soon as I saw the internet-hit "A Million Ways", I was hooked. After sampling a few songs on ITunes, I immediately ordered the album. This was one of the first times I had ever ordered an album without first hearing all of the songs. I indeed had only listed to a few 30-second clips, maybe 3 or 4, and was so impressed by this little bit I took the leap of faith and bought the whole thing. I popped my headphones. And was subsequently blown away. The opening track, "Invincible" is so powerful, so mighty and so skillful I felt so torn apart when I moved to the next song to listen to that. "Do What You Want" would sound like the product of another band if it weren't for Damian Kulash's unique and easily recognizable vocals. It was, like the first track, amazing. Needless to say, I ended up listening to the album multiple times, and never felt bored or tired of it. Oh No is such a masterfully produced album, it's almost like a collection of bands took their best songs and said "Ok Go, please perform these songs". In other words, every song rings like a power-packed solo, immersing the listener in a world of its own. See for yourself: Try to find two songs on the album that sound anything alike. From the mellow disco-bass-driven "A Million Ways" to the beautifully bizarre and upbeat/downbeat "Oh Lately It's So Quiet", to the Death Cab-ish "Let It Rain", to the Get-up-and-dance "Television, Television". Nothing, however, is perfect. Two songs stick out like pimples on this otherwise beautiful face: "Crash the Party" and "It's A Disaster", which seem painfully uninspired compared to the rest. Also, a few songs suffer from "My chorus-doesn't-match-my-verse" syndrome, but this is simply a style, not necesarily a downfall. I personally didn't care for it, but it goes to show OK GO defines their genre and sets trends, rather than follow them. Buy Oh No. You won't regret it. Look at the rating! 5 stars! Look how many reviews gave it that. Why haven't you bought it yet 
While OK Go still is a little to concerned with their fashion and try a little too hard, they have managed to produces a fairly satifying album that was much better than their first (nothing was as good as Get Over It though). You want proof this band is trying too hard? Whats their favorite word? ... "Hey!!!" hopefully you recognized it. While the songs are often catchy, after extensive listening this album wares on my nerves; 'Do What You Want' went from my favorite song on the album to one of my least favorites in about a month. Overall - 7/10 This is probably worth buying, definitely more than its predecessor 
If you feel they sound familiar, they do. OK Go may be the "most recent" revival bands to hit the airwaves (think Franz Ferdinand). However, they've managed to reach pseudo-cult status thanks to their fun videos. If you can, check them out on YouTube: you will have a good laugh 
Oh No starts out with incredible guitar shredding riffs moving through upbeat songs and a seductive ghost song to finish off with The House Wins, a song with a powerful message that will give you goose bumps, make you think, and most importantly drool from the mouth over the rock!!! -Arcean_Novalogi 
Ok Go is my new favorite band! I love their awesome music and creative dance routines. If you enjoy smiling, then buy this album 
This is one of the albums people dream of. I usually tire of listening to the same thing over and over but this has been in my rotation now for about 3 months. Every song is reeking brilliance and is definately a force to be reckoned with 
This album is fantastic!! There is not a bad song on it to be found! From the upbeat and rocking "Do What You Want" and "Here It Goes Again", to the more mellow "Let It Rain" and "Lately Its So Quiet", this is a super album. If you don't have it yet, well then why are you still sitting here reading reviews?? GO GO GET IT NOW OK?? (get it...ok go get it now?) :) 
If anything buy the cd for the last song, "She Looking Out A Window." I don't know how to put this into words, but this has got to be one of the best songs written in the last 15 years, and sadly enough it sits in obscurity. The rest of the album which consists of demos, is very listenable. But the prize in the ceral box is "She's Looking Out A Window." A song that encapsulates longing and regret so well it should be used as the definition in any dictionary in any language. Who hasn't looked back at old photographs when a relationship seemed invincible, only to have it crumble before their eyes? You have that moment forever, frozen in time, but you can't touch it, you can't feel it, you can only remember the smell of their hair, they way they looked when they slept next to you, the way they laughed, and how they cried. This song hits on all those emotions. Truly an amazing piece of music. 
This album is hard to review. It has some very strong songs on it: Dig Down Deep, I tried, and Blunderbuss. Listen to the samples, they are a pretty good indication. They are beautifully crafted, melodic, and just generally wonderful. Brad is a tuneful writer, with an interesting, slightly unconventional voice to his credit. But among the tracks are some duds too. I'm unable to listen to the CD all the way through. I get the impression that Brad didn't have a band, but he knew a lot of different musicians, and had ALMOST an album's worth of tunes when he started. The album drifts from pop masterpieces to unfortunate rock mishaps. The good tunes sound like Jellyfish... the bad tunes sound like the Smithereens on a 4-Track. Plus, I'm not getting a lot of feeling out of these songs. Even the best tunes, while well crafted musically, aren't personal at all. I still have no sense of who Brad Jones is. I hope to hear more from Brad in the future, but, if you are planning on buying this album, be prepared for a jumble. Still, for the impressive craftsmanship on the good tracks, I give this album 4 stars. As long as I'm here, I should mention that you should check out Steve Ward's solo album... It's like this one, only more consistent and definitely more heartfelt 
For those of us who fear that "American Idol" is in the process of ruining an entire generation of performers, this disc gives hope. In making this record, Herbie has taught an entire roster of "stars" that part being a star is to know that every note DOESN'T HAVE TO BE over-sung or over-played. This set is packed with wonderfully matched songs and artists with arrangement that bring out the best in all. The singing of Paul Simon, Annie Lennox, Damien Rice with Lisa Hannigan and John Mayer is top notch. And, Christina Aquilera has NEVER sounded this good! And one final thing. The control and restraint by Herbie Hancock is amazing. Don't worry. He GETS his moments to shine on this disc. But he is masterful in getting out of the way so others can share the spotlight. POSSIBILITIES is fun and uplifting. At other points, it is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly sad discs that I've ever heard. It will always be in my music collection and will offer different things to appreciate with each listening. BUY THIS ONE!!! 
I loved this CD. It is a variety of artists and very upbeat 
I was expecting every song on the CD to be great but there were about three songs that didn't wow me 
Her version of the Carpenters hit, "A Song For You" gives me goosebumps. I had NO IDEA she could sing! WOW 
I really like this cd, varied artists. I bought it for the Christina Aguilera song, her best I think 
Four stars only because I'm not sure there's ever been an album or CD in which every song is great, except maybe Sgt. Pepper (just my opinion). Musical geniuses who don't need to prove themselves eventually evolve to the point where they create music for sound only and not to prove how great they are at singing or playing the guitar, etc. A classic example is Joe Sample whose piano playing is often the underlying music for a great deal of the playing time of his songs. But the blend therein is usually wonderful. Other examples include the Sting, The Beatles, Donald Fagen (Steely Dan), etc. With "Possibilities", Hancock seems to have reached that point in his career. Not pure jazz, not just pop, just great sound. 
An incredible album. I especially like the songs with Santana, Sting and Christine Aguillara. A very relaxing jazzy CD 
Herbie Hancock is an indexing nightmare. His love for experimentation has seen him tagged under techno, funk, rock, disco, hip hop, electronica, and I almost forgot, jazz, though I have almost all of his work tagged under classics and favorites. It was with some trepidation that the purist in me first listened to Possibilities since I have not yet been able to appreciate why The Definitive Herbie should include Rock-It. However, after several listens, this album stands out as a fine partnership that showcases the real talent of the singer collaborators (and Phish guitarist Tray Anastacio) who are spurred by the subtle and nonintrusive yet demanding backing of Hancock. The opening track with aspiring bluesboy John Mayer, Stitched Up, sets the tone for the rest of the album, you are going to listen to pop, but of a highly jazzed up sort. Stitched Up is bouncy, minimalist swing, something that tells you to sit back and enjoy, and not to take things too seriously. Santana and Angelique Kidjo team up for Safiatou, a standard Santana riff-held song, one wonders if Hancock is employing restraint or is just not into it. To be taken strictly as a Santana track. Christina Aguilera on Song For You comes and changes that, and you realize how untapped this lady's singing is. Her Grammy awards night performance of the same song is however a slightly better version though it falters a bit as it climaxes to a close. Sting comes across on Sister Moon like a track missed out on All This Time, brooding and beautifully twisted, and one is reminded of his 1987 Umbria Jazz Fest performance with Gil Evans. When Love Comes to Town with Joss Stone and Johnny Lang is a classic blues rock, complete with growls and yelps, and the duo belt it out with reckless abandon, a pleasure indeed, reminds me strangely of Pam Crain and Nondon Bagchi. The three songs that take time and repeat listens to make their point are Annie Lennox's Hush, Hush, Hush, Paul Simons I Do It For Your Love, and Raul Midon's I Just Called To Say I Love You. Overall, a great album if one approaches it without preconditions. This is not a Hancock showcaser, he is just providing the consistency to the gravy, and good gravy it is. The singers all bring their best to the album, and are allowed to do what they want without being overpowered or jazzed over. A definite good buy 
It's interesting to me that Tangerine Dream and song 8:07 were mentioned in an earlier review because when I first heard 8:07/5:23, I thought they were tracks from Risky Business that I had not yet heard or remixes of ones that I had. Having said that, this is still a pretty good CD. I've always liked 14:31 and 4:14. 
This album makes it to the top of my ambient music collection. It even replaces Ishq "Orchid" which held the #1 position since August 2004. If you are looking for an instrumental ambient CD that you can relax to or take a mental journey with, this is the one. I sometimes put the headphones on at work to block out the co-workers and listen or pop it in the CD player on the way home to unwind. My favorite tracks are 14:31, 9:39, and 12:18. The liner notes reveal that the band didn't want to bias your listening experience by naming the tracks. Definitely a sentiment I agree with 
This is the type of CD you can kick back and listen to and just let your thoughts go. I love what GC puts together as the "Mark and Tom show," and the sounds they create are just mesmorizing! Next to PM, this CD is at the very top! One hell of a mix!! Thanks guys... 
is this landmark CD. Treat yourself to the evolving soundscapes included in this excellent ambient collection 
Wow...wow wow wow wow...I've heard a LOT of albums (over 3,000), but this one is INCREDIBLE. It's true that I only have a small amount of ambient albums (The Orb, Orbital, Mouse On Mars, Biosphere, Aphex Twin, Colleen, DJ Wally, etc...), but this one is just so ridiculously good I can't even come up with the right words to praise it. It's definitely an ambient album, but it's more of an experience then anything else - it feels like you're in another world when you're listening to this. The production here is amazing - obviously I have no idea how to describe the electronic blips and bloops, but they're all very high quality, fun and interesting to pay attention to. It's an audio journey like no other. I suppose you could say it's ambient music with some house mixed in, but essentially it's just a great "chill-out" album to groove to. When it comes to this kind of music there isn't much else you can say about it, really. If you like ambient music in the slightest then "76:14" will probably be the best darn ambient album you ever get! Absolutely recommended! Highlights include: the entire album 
any mp3 you find can't do this justice - you need the original article. buy it an be glad you did. this album is chill as f**k, but it won't put you to sleep. in the same way that reich or glass can maintain the static dynamic, this album is always on the move if you look - otherwise, it will be content to lounge in the background. I like it most because it is what I think of as an 'optional listening' album: there is great depth if you choose to listen critically, yet the album doesn't require a thinking cap to enjoy. (and yes, that is a very intentional dig at recent 'idm'. 
So they forever listened...........But listen tracks 7 and 8 entitled 8 07, isn't that the music playing while Tom Cruise was givin' it to Rebecca DeMorney on the train in "Risky Business"? Track # five sounds like something from the Goonies,(when the bells chime in). 9 25 is my fave, as well as 4 14. A great listen; Tom Middleton is top notch 
I am a big Tangerine Dream fan as far as electronic music goes, so I want to be sure if you read this you have an idea of what direction I take. I am a composer/arranger/performer I'm working on a project of primarily electronic music based on Roman Greek myths. So, I've been picking up CD's from other groups/artists to get a different aural view than TD. This group is in the catagory of what I consider big on arrangements/backgrounds, but not much on actually being in the music. By this I mean, imagine Eric Clapton's " Wonderful Tonite " without a vocal guitar lead. GC has a number of good ideas musical landscapes. For that alone, I enjoyed listening to this CD I am continuing to do so, at least once a week. However, compared to TD, for instance, there's a lot lacking. Almost no actuall lead or melodic lines give this CD an almost movie soundtrack/background sound. Also, it makes this group sound like they aren't willing to risk taking the chance of having a go at a lead pass. A lot of samples cleaverly mixed together, but for me, it sounds like a background arrangement ( a rythm bed ), but the final touches are missing. all that said, I do recommend this CD, if only for the cleaver work this group does. High quality work 
Mef's fourth solo album is a masterpiece. after the so so Tical 2000, and the horrible Tical 0, Mef brings back the style that first made us love him. 4:21... The Day After, comes during a tough time in hip hop. Radio only plays very commercial songs now, and they all song the same. Mef brings it back to the early 90's and reflects his life from then to now. And for the haters, just listen to the song Say, which in my opinion, is one of the best hip hop songs ever. Mef brings himself out on this track and tells everything, from not being able to make a album his way to the death of his friend ODB. Dirty makes a guest appearance on the song Dirty Mef, which really sounds like a song from the old 36 chambers days. The production from RZA and Erick Sermon (two of my favorite producers) bring out Mef at his best. Even the song with Redman, Walk On, has an old school to it and Mef and Red pass verses back and forth. Favorites include Is It Me, Problem, Fall Out, Dirty Mef ft. ODB, The Glide ft. Raekwon and LA the Darkman, Say ft. Lauren Hill, Ya'meen ft. Fat Joe and Styles P, Everything ft. Inspectah Deck and Streetlife, Walk On ft. Redman, Presidential MC ft. Raekwon and RZA, and 4 Ever ft. Megan Rochell. Highly Highly Recommended 
When Tical O came out Method man surprised Wu fans everywhere with the worst album out of the Wu camp(yes even worser than Ugodzilla). Im happy to say that this album is a definite improvement from that slop of an album. Standout Tracks: DIRTY MEF(Rip ODB), INTRO, IS IT ME(is it me or are Scott Storch's beats starting to sound like Dr Dre's s***), PROBLEM, SOMEBODY DONE F***ED UP, FALL OUT, THE GLIDE, YA MEEN(minus Fat Joe's craptastic verse), EVERYTHING etc. Filler: Lets Ride, Got to have it, Presidential Mc(Raekwon and Rza bought this track down with some suspect verses) and 4ever. Konichiwa bitches had the makings of a banger but it is ruined by a stupid hook(konichiwa bitches?). Bottom Line: Method Man came back from a garbage album(Tical O) with a solid fourth effort. He stepped his rap game up and the production was not bad. Definetely a highlight album in 2006 
Man this is a very good rebirth for meth. He has never been one who has been gifted lyrically but throughout the years meth has proven that he has one of the most potent flows in the business. He rides tracks effortlessly but his words often aren't very powerful. I u, the reader, should expect that going into this album. The thing that's noticably different about this album is the production. Even though jay-z didn't executive produce this album his obvious fingerprints are still all over it. Young Guru mixed a lot of the songs jayz must have picked these songs and the album sequence. Sadly meth will never make a classic album on this album he maximizes his potential. You see when wu-tang said that they form like voltron, they weren't lying. Every member serves a purpose and meth is a glorified hypeman with a very potent flow. Jay-z has a very, very good ear for music. Every def jam release so far has been excellent even the lupe fiasco album he oversaw was excellent. Meth please, please see jay-z is here to help you and the other artist on the label, jigga wants you to succeed and is not trying to overshadow you because your audiences are different! 
It is unfortunate that real hip hop is dead. Who do you blame? I tell you that it can't be blamed on this album. Mef(because black people don't use the th)has given real hip hop heads that can still remember what hip hop was like in the mid 90's a more than solid effort. I read 1 review up here and had 2 correct it. If you sleep thru this album that means you like franchise boys and d4l(aaaah!!!!) But from the opener this album just catches you. Is it me and problems are the 2 best opening tracks that I heard on an album in years. You have classic production from E-Dubb(4 the youngin's that's Erick Sermon) and Scott Storch and Rza. If you fall 2 sleep on this album at all it's during Fat Joe's verse on Ya Mean but Styles brings the adrenaline back with his verse(thanks S P D Block!!) Overall the album is by far Mef's best and if you can't hear it then please stop listening 2 hip hop and go listen 2 dipset(ha ha!!!) But Mef if you ever see this review real hip hop fans THANK YOU for this album and resurrecting the sound of the Green Eyed Bandit that is greatly needed in hip hop. I can go on and on about this album but the point I'm trying 2 make is that this album is greatly needed for any hip hop head. And Mef do me 1 more favor and find Redman because I'm in desperate need of Blackout2!!!!!!!! PS Fat Joe go back 2 that Don Cartagena flow that heads wanna hear because you were clearly trying 2 do your best Jay-Z rendition on Ya Mean and failed!!! 
Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times. I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually. Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman? Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim. Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale. But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story. 4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling. There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic "Is It Me" or the posthumous verse of ODB on "Dirty Mef." You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted "Say," the Erick Sermon produced "Gotta Have It," or even "Let's Ride" featuring Ginuwine as being decent. One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical. But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man. I mean, "Somebody Done F*cked Up" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once. The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists. Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like "4:20" and "Everything" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.) And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but "Presidential M.C." comes and goes without much fanfare. Other weak selections include "Konichiwa B*tches," "4Ever" featuring Megan Rochell, and "Fall Out." I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection. This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career. Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt. 
This is the type of album most artists are trying and hoping to make for their whole career. Every facet of hip hop music is represented well here, meth flexes his lyrical muscle and demonstrates his versitility on solulful concious tracks, grimey tracks, and straight up bangers. The album is very balaced and I wouldnt hesitate to liken it to Jay-Z's blueprint. "Say" is one of the best hip hop songs to be released in 2-3 years. Any fan of Wu-tang, or Method Man himself in either his Tical or Red Meth incarnations will be elated with this album. A must buy for any fan of Hip-Hop music 
Mr. Mef will always have a very soft-spot in my heart. As a hardcore Clan head, Meth has always been one of my favorite rappers in the game, with his gruff, but smooth delivery, and rhymes so witty, you'd press "Rewind" every ten seconds. The P-A-N-T-Y-R-A-I-D-E-R made a name for himself in Enter The Wu-Tang, and he followed up his amazing performance there with the first Clan solo album, Tical. Tical was fantastic. The Iron Lung showed where he was coming from, as each track on that album was streaming with gold, and to this day, it remains one of my top ten hip-hop albums. However, something seemed to happen. Meth had some classic guest appearances throughout the early nineties, with fellow Clan members, and friends outside of the circle(most notably, Notorious B.I.G. and Redman). Wu-Tang Forever dropped, and Meth was still in top-form. Then something curious happened. The long awaited sequel to Tical, Tical 2000: Judgement Day dropped, and it was, to put it gently, not too good. His album with Redman, Black Out, holds on that same opinion. Many, many guest appearance later, and Meth dropped his third solo LP, Tical 0, and to say that stunk would be an understatement. I wanted to like this album. The Wu's been putting out some great releases in the last couple years, mainly from Ghostface, GZA, and Masta Killa. I wanted to believe that Mr. Meth could drop a FishScale, a Grandmasters, or a No Said Date. I wanted this so badly. We can't always get what we want. There's one thing that Clan heads know, and that is the production the original members sound best flowing over. Ghostface sounds best over soul samples, Inspectah Deck over funk, GZA over gritty, yet epic beats, Raekwon over theatrical beats, etc. Method Man sounds best over the gritty, yet funky production that only RZA can provide, and on the cuts RZA does produce, this album shines. However, when Method Man takes the Scott Storch rote, and flows over polished, and overproduced beats, he just sounds so misplaced. This album is highly dissapointing. While it isn't completely worthless, do to a few of the great cuts(The Glide, 4:20, Presidential MC's), it could've been done without. This album is Tical 0 with a few RZA joints on it; that's all. I still love Meth, don't get me wrong, but this album is just another stain on his respectable legacy. Sorry, Johnny, but a lot of things have changed in the last 13 years, and none of them have been for the better 
I must say, Tom Petty has to be the most consistent in rock and roll for releasing excellent music. Highway Companion is just one more example of outstanding rock and roll. While this one is certainly no Damn the Torpedos or Full Moon Fever, every track is solid. It took me a few listens before I really began to appreciate it fully. The best songs are probably Saving Grace, Down South, and Ankle Deep, and there is not a weak one in the bunch - no filler here. Buy this and put it in your car CD player, and it will inevitably be your new Highway Companion! 
I've been a Tom Petty fan for a long time. I've seen him in concert twice and there's very little of his work I don't love. I bought this cd without having heard so much as a note from it. I love it, especially tracks 1,2,3,4,5,7,10. His music has changed over the years, how could it not? I find it amusing when reviewers say things like "he's not like he was 25 years ago! Are You? I find nothing more classless than a musician making embarrassing attempts at singing and acting like he's still 25. I think the Stones are the perfect example of this; honestly they look and sound like hell. Nonetheless, Tom still sounds great. I really love Down South, This Old Town and Square One. His music has always had a way of touching me and it still does. I also loved the Last DJ and Echo. The engineering is excellent, the tracks are crystal clear, and the string and keyboard solos are stellar. 
Tom Petty did it again. Maybe a bit less rocking than some of his efforts, and missing most of the Heartbreakers, Highway Companion remains a album you (and your kids if you have any) will enjoy. My four year old insists on listening to Highway Companion on the way to nursery school and has the lyrics to Saving Grace memorized. My 8 year old has most of the album memorized. Great CD, highly recommended 
This is a good album with Tom Petty revisiting some of his favorite stylings 
Bought this CD on a whim, and have been listening to it non-stop ever since. Tom Petty still brings it! I enjoy the faster songs more than some of the slower "ballad-type" songs, but they are all goo 
This is a cd you can listen too all the way through, over and over agin 
If you like Tom Petty than you'll love this album. There are no surprises but the songs are fresh and the recording quality is very good 
I really enjoyed this entire CD actually but You Got Me is what sealed the deal on this one. They have a different style about them and I would recommend this to anyone. 
this albums real hot but unlike a previous person said... its not just from 1 show... it was put together from different shows... its obvious when they change the lyrics around in different cities but anyways i heard the whole new kanye album... alot of the tracks were unfinished but it is real nasty u gotta buy that when it drops next wee 
The Roots standout in a world of cookie-cutter, non-original artist. Combining live instruments and the ridiculous flow of Black Thought, the Roots bring a fantastic and unduplicable blend of hip-hop, jazz, and soul. The Roots Come Alive is not only my favorite Roots album, but my favorite album overall. With this album you get the Roots in the atomsphere were they thrive, the live show. The performances of their standards are expectional and it makes for a great listening experience. Although the flaws of the album are humbly pointed out by Quest?love in the liner notes, you would not have picked up on them without this hint. Overall the album is definitely a gem and an instant classic 
I'm into alot of underground types of music but when it comes to hip hop I only like the pure stuff and the pure stuff in my opinion is having MC's with an old jazz band and DJ behind them. This is a bit of what I think of the roots and this is a really good live album. I was very surprised when I put this on cause I expected ahhh how do you say it....[BAD] LIVE SOUND but I was so wrong you can brand me with a DUNCE on my forehead. The album sounds so good that it hard to believe that the album takes place live but the Roots are one of those definitive band that will indefinitely influence future artists to come. GOOD SHOW 
J-Live has surpassed my level of expectations and has raised the bar for the hiphop community. From my perspective, he is now the barometer in which I will rate forthcoming hiphop/rap CD's. Its just that serious. The brother has exponded on some serious issues with the depth that I have been seeking from this genre. Just listen to what he is saying about our lives and realize that this artist has a level of commitment that is almost unthought of today. The beats, tracks, flow, delivery and knowledge is TIGHT------. You know it from the onset of the first track.(BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM) His first joint "Always Has Been"(almost killed him) set him into motion which had serious beats and tracks but did not get quite deep as his second offering "All of the Above"(almost killed him) we began to touch upon his devotion to what this genre is really supposed to be about: teaching,life lessons, past discretions and new directions. You Get The Grammy. I have been listening to Kweli, Haiku D'Tet, and this joint they are all on the level but you just went a little deeper. Thanks J-Live. If you like real, authentic, organic hip hop you better run get this joint. On Second thought "Get ALL THREE" UNDERGROUND (underwater) CLASSICS. I can't believe the reviewers who say they love J are rating this offering so low. It really is his best All of the Above is running a close second. And for all of you reviewers who feels this offering does not suffice, maybe you need to go get some of that new dirty south, so you can come back to J- Humbly. And for Saltzman(reviewer), you lack direction, how much do you really know about the life of the bonafide rap community, not the johnny come lately riders or lifelong suburbanite who suddenly moved to the city and listens to hip hop (commercially used terminology which is really RAP MUSIC) because they are trying to be down. But those who can go back to Furious Five(5), Fab 5 Freddy, Curtis Blow, Kool Moe D, Run DMC, or oldschool LL back in the day. Make sure you know the history of this before you start to use words like direction. Because J's direction is clear, listen to Brooklyn Public, Sidewalk, Audio Visual, and Weather The Storm, (those are enough to get you started. The rest of the joints like Here, Aaw Yeah, Do My Thing, Firewater, and Whoever just establish his presence, help to develop a visual portrait and outlines his philosophical perspective. (if that is not direction, then what is? Coming Home(which is a banger feature Dwele) and Thereafter just put the icing on the cake. And for those who feels that The Listening is there favorite track. Well, I guess it doesn't take much for you. I am feeling that selection, but I put it on the level of an interlude. Sometimes I wonder, if there is really more lead in the water than first suspected. Go Get This Classic TruHop Music. To all of you 4 STAR REVIEWS stop cheatin J out of the credit he deserves for this phenonmenal project. It really pisses me off as challenging as it is for an underground artist with substance is to get respect. You all should be ashamed because I am. If you should read this J-Live: U WAXED IT 
Although this was not "The Best of" or "All of the Above" J-Live definitely swung for the fences with the hereafter. His signature style of mixing jazz, poetry, and hip hop is apparent in this release. There are a lot of outstanding tracks on this album with "Listening" being my favorite. Definitely a must have for those who love hip hop, or those who just want to chill. If you want to see J-Live, get Da Bassment T.V. on DVD. What he does with the turntables and the mic at the same time is crazee 
Before I start off, I would like to mention that I wasn't all that big a fan of J-Live prior to "The Hear After." And yes, I do have "All of the Above." While there were some killer tracks on "AOTA," on the whole the album was a little bland and hard to listen to even twice in a row (I'll expound on this in a minute). Anyways, I didn't hesitate when this came out, because I was interested in seeing if he was at the end of his career or not... The only lousy song was "Do My Thing," which had a subpar beat and tried too hard to be 'club-ish.' There are a couple other songs ("I'm Coming Home" and "After") that aren't so interesting, but good enough, and everything else ranges from on-point to phenomenal. For real, the first song goes for the jugular with live instruments and J spittin' nonstop for over 3 minutes straight. Quite the leadoff! J can be found throughout putting more personality and messages in the rhymes than I thought he was capable of. While digital and synthesized sounds are tolerable in small doses, he takes a risk and does back-to-back songs ("The Sidewalks," "Audio Visual") with those in it. Although a tad annoying at first, he pulls it off because those two tracks happen to be among his strongest moments lyrically on the album. "Harder" is an outstanding jam, with numerous live instruments, and I wonder if J's ever gotten down like that on a track before. "Fire Water" has a hard, yet laid-back beat with a guitar in the foreground, "Whoever" kinda has a Spanish feel to it, and the beats of "Brooklyn Public Pt. 1" and "Listening" add to the diversity of the album. "Weather the Storm" almost sounds like it has a bagpipe, while J delivers some heavy-handed political and socio-political raps. The top five songs are: "Here," "Sidewalks," "Audio Visual," "Harder," and "Weather the Storm." And that list seems to discredit such great songs as "Fire Water," "Brooklyn Public," "Whoever," and "Aaw Yeah." The thing that was appealing about "All of the Above" were the numerous concepts that J incorporated in many of the tracks. The concepts were admirable ("All In Together Now," "Stir of Echoes," "One For the Griot"), and definitely great on paper, but the execution on some of them just wasn't that interesting. That whole album just seemed to lack personality and any separation from other undergrounders. This album, however, seemed to have plenty of personality, as I started to understand him more with tracks like "Sidewalks" and "Brooklyn Public." He doesn't really try for any lofty concepts this time around, although he does seem to find a term for letters "A" through "L" within 10 seconds on "Whoever." The vocabulary and metaphors were aplenty as it is on this album (check the well-executed metaphor of "Fire Water"). I love that line: "Throw it on the rocks it'll still burn, go ahead and throw it on your wounds, it'll kill germs." The quotables are incalcuble on "The Hear After." The production is sometimes excellent, but for the most part solid and commendale throughout (bar "Do My Thing"). The "Hear After" is much more cohesive than the bloated "AOTA," and like I said, this one has plenty of diversity. This former Brooklyn teacher proved how serious he is with this Hip Hop thing, and delivers an album that is easily one of the finest of the year. So if you already spent your money on Kanye West, turn right around and pick up this piece of gold from the store. My only problem now is...finding out where I can get "The Best Part." Peace yawl, peace yawl, pe-da-de-da pe-da-de-da peace yawl 
J-Live returns with his 2005 release The Hear After. The results vary, but for the most part, the songs are tight. There are bangers on the album like "Harder", "Whoever", and "Aaw Yeah". You can also expect J to flip words and paint pictures like he's been known to do on tracks like "Audio Visual" and "Listening". To me, this is his strength. But if you're into J-Live, then you know that the lyrical aspect of the album will be on point and he doesn't disappoint on this album. Two thumbs up for the content. As far as shortcomings, there are a few, but there aren't necessarily any wack songs. There are some beats that don't quite fit J (Do My Thing) and there a few forgettable tracks. Tracks like "Fire Water" and "The Sidewalks" are good, but they have a sleep inducing effect. They aren't wack, but they are a little slow/boring. But aside from a few boring tracks and a few weak beats, the rest of the album is tight. As a whole, The Hear After is more than worth purchasing. J-Live's rhymes are always on point. The problem is that the production on some of the tracks isn't up to par (especially for J's standards). It's definitely one of the better 2005 rap releases though and would make a solid addition to any CD collection. Standout Tracks: Listening feat. Kola Rock, Aaw Yeah, Audio Visual, Coming Home feat. Dwele, Whoever (My Favorite), Weather The Storm, Harder, After 
Let's get this out of the way first, if you're searching for beat-driven, crunk infused, boombastic thumpers, then conitnue your search. If there's one thing J-Live wants you to know by the end of the album, it's that MCing comes first. In this regard I agree with the other reviewer here who mentions the decline in production, and the subsequent shift to the lyrics. However, by my tastes, I really enjoy the production, the musical style and variety, and, of course, the lyrics. The one thing that prevents me from putting this album at "All of the Above" level is the absence of thematic and structural creativity that made that album a classic. I'm thinking of songs like All in Together Now and the track with the varying endings. Still, J-Live flexes his lyrical ability as well as ever. To my understanding, J-Live used to teach middle school English, and being that I teach 7th grade English, "Brooklyn Public Part 1" is a personal favorite. Though I cannot empathize with the experience of those in Brooklyn schools, I can certainly identify with J's jabs at principals, school boards, lazy and cynical teachers, testing, and in general, the illogical and thwarting nature of the public schooling system. There's also a sweet verse which just continually gives name to the countless variety of students you encounter in schools, "Some are motivated, some are lazy, some are geniuses, some are crazy, the line between is hazy." This track's selling point to me, is the way that J-Live delivers these points, not in a condescending tone, but as if we, the listeners, are on a moving belt, traveling through a school, witnessing what our guide, J-Live, is telling us. The music backdrop is also great here with a piano sounding as if it was pulled right from a high school auditorium, and a reocurring "Ohhhh ohh" chant. Other beats on the album don't impress as they did on "All of the Above" because I feel that album contains more breaks and change-ups during songs. I do not deduct points for this, though, because I feel the production is more precise, and the songwriting is more focused (perhaps the cause for the absence of songs that take a leap in creativity). Despite the move towards songs with the fewer breaks, there is still a wide variety of songs styles, most with memorable hooks. The album opener, "Here", featuring the well-known jam band Soulive, sounds like the child of "Black on Both Sides" and "The New Danger" by Mighty Mos Def. "Do My Thing" has a cool synth loop, and "Whoever" features a surprisingly groovy latin/carribean mix with some well-placed scratching. This track also displays some of J-Live's best flow on the album. The follwing track, "The Sidewalks", is another favorite and deals with J-Live's childhood stomping grounds, NYC. The beat is heavy, and the twisting, high-pitched synth line in the background is straight out of an Eazy-E track. The lyrics in this song simultaneously, and effectively, dismantle biter MCs from the area, offer praise to the capital of the world, and make clear J-Live's roots in the same communities so many other rappers use as an excuse to talk of (or more accurately, glorify) lives of depravity, self-absorbed behavior, and fantasical imaginings of grandiose lives drenched in death, sex, and drugs. I applaud J-Live's ability to persevere through life on the same tough streets, and come out a messenger of knowledge and hope. J-Live perfectly embodies the ultimate frustration in hip-hop and all of pop culture today: he is an artist as talented as any in his craft, yet the wisdom and truth with which he speaks will prohibit his words from reaching the people, and the great number of these people, that they need to reach. Without sacrificing the infectious vibe that is absent in much underground hip-hop, J-Live continues in the long line of great African-American thinkers who see the still present entrapments of his race, and warns of the dangers of complacency and indiffence, all with the spirit of hope, and the purpose of a teacher. I hope it will be soon when we ALL are ready to learn 
The Hear After is an album that true hip-hop heads will enjoy. Guest artists on the album include Soulive, Cvees, Kola Rock and Dwele. The album opens up with the song "Here." The production on this song is wicked. A real stand out track on the album is "Fire Water." This song is so hot. The track almost sounds like it is mixed with a song from The Cure. This is a great song. The song "Whoever" is another song with crazy production. It's a great bouncy summer song with a slight salsa feel to it. "Audio Visual" is a laid back sounding song. New Yorker's will enjoy the song "Brooklyn Public Part 1." This song laments about the overcrowding and bad situations plaguing the New York School System. Female rapper Kola Rock shines on the song "Listening." This is a song with a unique concept. The Hear After is a very musical album and the lyrics are engaging. If you like Wordsworth, Tribe Called Quest, Common, Talib Kweli, Heiroglyphics, Mystic or other hip-hop artists, you will enjoy this album. 
Don't think of buying this instead of the two (2) studio albums. Buy this as companion. This is what the Dolls sounded like when you saw them in a cramped, sweaty club in 1973. Young, hungry, urgent, sassy, and confident. The star is Jerry Nolan's drumming. No matter what chaos was happening up front, Jerry slams the back beat and keeps the boys in line. Arthur's rumble bass is up front, and better represented here than in either studio album. Let's hear it for the underappreciated rhythm section. David is in exceptional voice throughout, and Johnny's nasal off-key vocals make me smile. I can see his screwed up face everytime he squeals "Trash!" or "I'm a human bein'." That's Queens, N'Yawk talkin' at you. Syl fills in all the blanks energetically and inventively. I've been waiting years to relive the Dolls' sloppy wonderful version of "Give Her A Great Big Kiss." Marty Thau's liner notes are heartfelt. I remember him first showing up at the Mercer Arts Center. Looking old school record biz promotor with a gang of juvenile deliquents. My only regret is that "Endless Party" was left off. It was always my favorite Dolls' song, and one that typified what they were like. RIP Billy, Johnny, Jerry, Arthur. Rock on, David and Syl 
This is the good stuff.....raw and live versions with better sound quality than any of their studio recordings. 
Where did these guys come from? How'd they make women's clothes look masculine? I can imagine Marty's amazement when he walked into the Mercer Arts Center. Amazement and joy. I guess there've been several revolutions in rock. I always considered the three main stages to be Chuck Berry, the Beatles, and the Ramones. But that third stage really started with the New York Dolls. (OK, nods to Lou Reed, T. Rex, Bowie, Iggy, Alice; they definitely contributed.) Anyway, I agree with the other reviewers that this is the Dolls best disc (or at least tied with the first album). It gives us the boys performing all the songs on the two albums (except no "Puss 'n' Boots") before Todd and Shadow produced them. Todd did a great job with the first album, and Shadow did a very good one with the second; but here we have the raw material. I'm thrilled to hear this after all these years. I didn't even know it existed. The band is brimming with excitement, attitude, and positive energy. (A lot of people don't realize that about the Dolls and the Ramones: the music is happy, even if some of the subjects aren't exactly comedic.) Johnny Thunders was perhaps the best pure rock guitarist of all time; right alongside Chuck Berry, and probably ahead of Keith Richards. I'm so glad nobody has any interest in this music except for a couple o' hundred people. Let 'em eat cake. 
This is a great representation of what the Dolls where all about. The tracks are live in the studio and appropriately loose, feeling as if they might just implode at any minute. If your a Dolls fan, this is a must have. Will be revisiting these tracks tomorrow night when the reformed Dolls play the 9:30 Club in DC. They may fewer in number and a bit rough around the edges but it only adds to Syl and David's considerable charms. They're as campy and wonderful as ever and the new guys fill in ably (great to see Sammi YAffa from Hanoi rocks - one of the few bands who truly "got" the Dolls - filling in for Arthur). It ain't 1973 at Mercer Arts but they still wipe the floor with any of the over-hyped, over-rated bands who count them as an influence. 
 "Hard Night's Day" shows just how great this band really was. These tracks are basically in studio demos, recorded live with no overdubs. From David Johansen's growling vocals, to Nolan's precision drumming and finally Johnny Thunder's slashing riffs rythms, this cd is all killer and no filler. This music has been presented on other releases, but I believe the 21 tracks included here make this album the most comprehensive album release available of this material. Purchasing this album is pretty much a no brainer for any NYD fan. Even if you have these songs on other releases from other labels, they are not this complete and do NOT sound this good. If you are new to the NY Dolls, and happen to make it this far on curiosity alone, purchase this cd along with the compilation album "Rock N Roll" ASAP. It's is a great way to get you started. You can even get them both here in zShops for a really great price 
Was hard for me to believe at first,but this collection of 21 tracks the Dolls apparenty had in the vault as 'cutting room floor' material is pretty darn good.Tunes here were first penned in 1973,just before the band stepped into the studio to lay down cuts for their first album with producer Todd Rundgren.Songs like "Jet Boy","It's Too Late","Frankenstein","Lonely Planet Boy" and "Bad Girl" aren't all THAT different from the final version that made the lp.A great addition to any true Doll's fan CD stack.A keeper 
What a fun album! I never knew how great a live studio album could be until I bought this. All the energy of (fabulous) musicians playing together (instead of recording each track seperately like with a normal studio album), and with the clear sound of studio equipment. There's a lot of great cuts on here too, like "Seven Day Weekend," "Jet Boy," "Lookin' For a Kiss," and "Personality Crisis." If you're a Dolls fan, or just some young, naive punk looking to learn a bit about what started this whole punk thing, look no further 
If you're looking about getting into the Dolls, listen up. The Dolls only made 2 studio albums and they both can't match the sonic power of this offering. Yeah, it's not as polished as their studio works but that's what makes it so dang good. The first Dolls album isn't bad sounding but the second one sounds almost as weak as Back In The USA by the MC5. After hearing Kick out the Jams, you know it wasn't supposed to sound like that right? Well, not only do the Dolls run through pretty much their entire catalog at this point, but it's probably the best "live" and "studio" album you'll ever hear from these guys. So buy the other two if you want. I really suggest buying the first one and leaving Too Much, Too Soon alone. That album is an insult to what the Dolls really sounded like. Buy this and enjoy the Dolls as they were meant to sound. 
This album is simply a joy! David Johanson's hoarse, raspy voice is perfectly complemented by the rest of the band's ragged playing. Dolls Perfection! This album drives my wife nuts, but to me it's the most beautiful racket in the world, plus it's got a ton of songs 
This is my favorite Dolls CD. I was a little disapointed though because I bought this to replace my other '73 demos CD "7 Day Weekend". This one has 4 tracks that are not on that one, plus I heard that the sound quality on this one is better. Dolls rarity "Hoochie Coochie Man" is ommited, but I decided I could live without it. However, after I bought it I noticed that another rarity "Endless Party" was also ommited from this release...D'oh! Can't live without that one. So now I have to have both in my collection just to have the entire '73 demos. They're both good. The '73 demos are a must-have. Which CD to get between this and 7 Day Weekend is a toss-up. The version with more rarities VS the version with more Dolls standards &amp; slightly better sound is what it boils down to. If you're a sucker like me, get both 
This Soundtrack is the best one that I have ever heard. The movie is unique. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! 
For those of us who have been fortunate enough to have a glimpse of the mystery and majesty, that surrounds some of the hidden Himalayan kingdoms, this music will sound most familiar. Photographer and director of the film Himalaya, Eric Valli, has dedicated many years in capturing the essence of the people of Dolpo, Nepal. For years this tiny kingdom has been isolated from the rest of the world because of it's geographical location. The threat that the unique nomadic existence of these noble people will disappear, is very much a reality, hence the urge to portray the struggle and beauty of Dolpo on film. More than a movie, this is a living testimony of a culture interconnected to all of us. Bruno Coulais has captured the heart, spirit and mystery of the remarkable people of Dolpo. The soundtrack is evocative and without images transports us to the magical world somewhere between heaven and earth. From the intricacies of Buddhist faith to the grandeur of the highest mountains on earth, the music on this soundtrack has it all. 
Mmm ... where do I start? The movie itself was alright, a bit slow-moving, but touching and evocative of a distant culture and a way of life that most of us western-influenced audiences would find quite alien. The Himalayas' mountain-scape inspired awe as always, of course, but ultimately it was the soundtrack itself that lifted the movie from being merely interesting to being something sublime. Himalaya's score was even better than that for "Samsara", another excellent CD that transports the listener to the mystical Himalayan mountains. The best track on the Himalaya soundtrack is the one that incorporates the mantra of the Goddess Tara (the female counterpart of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion): "Om Tare Tutare Ture Svaha!". Listen to this CD and it might just ferry you across to the other shore 
....beautifully haunting, it elevates one's spirit to himalayan heights EVERY TIME; you won't regret this buy 
Not speaking or understanding Tibetian, didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie, and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why. It guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high trails, powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air. You are at once engulfed in the Tibetian life, you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants, singing bowls, and drums 
After seeing the gorgeous film, I ordered the CD within days. At first listen I only heard the occasional heavy string sections and felt that I'd rushed into buying a CD that failed to carry the spirit of the film. However, after a few spins in the ol' CD player, I found myself listening to it every day. A consistent soothing melody recurs throughout the CD, echoing the Buddhist chant: Om Mani Pedme Hung. Then, going out, I found the chant continuing in my mind. What a wonderful effect! Use this mantra of love and compassion to soften, to ease and soften your mind, energy and spirit. The CD ultimately has that power 
Using Tibetan incantations, Mr. Bruno Coulais has composed some of the best musical scores I have ever listened. Every piece of music depicts the real life struggles of these people of Dolpo. The compositions are so strong, so natural, sometimes so haunting, it draws you ever closer to these people. To those magnificent and breathtaking sceneries, Mr. Coulais has added another dimension; his music tells the story, the drama, the struggles of life in its true authentic way of life of the Tibetans. With each piece of music you travel along with the caravan, singing their songs, sharing their moments of joy and sorrow. Unlike other soundtracks this one really belongs to the people of Dolpo. You must really listen to believe me

Wow! I never imagined that U2 and Green Day would ever make a song together. It was just one of those things I never thought of. However, it is great. The song doesn't really sound like a Green Day song, but it does song like a U2 song. Billy Joe and Bono both trade off on the vocals, which gives the song many rich layers. As for the music itself, the song starts out soft with piano and then kicks into a fast and hard alternative rock song. This song is a strong performance for both Green Day and U2. I like Green Day, but love U2, and this song is just another wonderful piece of music to put in their catalog. As for the CD single, $10 is pretty pricey for a song that is going to be included on a best of collection. As for the live version, you can get on the Internet for like $1, so to buy this single, is sort of pointless. Perhaps some remixes or extra tracks, by either Green Day or U2 would have made this single worth $10. Oh well, The Saints are Coming is still a great song regardless. 
Two great bands collaborating... U2 and Green Day. I'd never have imagined it, seriously. This song's great: the beginning starts out with Billie Joe singing a few lines from The Animals "House Of The Rising Sun" (goes so perfectly with the Skids' lyrics) then Bono does his thing and it's just pure brilliance. Two great voices, one great song, and The Edge's signature guitar sound throughout the whole thing. Get it, it's totally worth your money 
For U2, they definitely know how to make great music as one group, but when they try to make it with another group in a collaboration, it is electrifying. The Saints Are Coming with Green Day is a great collabortaion that Bono and Billy Joe Armstrong really eliver on within each of their voices. The single is the highlight off U2's third greatest hits record U218 singles. I definitely like this track a whole lot, becasue there have been very few really promising duets this past year. I definitely hope that these guys can do something else together like maybe going on tour as one. Song: B 1/2+ 
If you watched the game, you know there was electricity in the air. This day was all about New Orleans, not the Saints, but the people who survived the worse natural disaster in American history. It would be silly for me to say this song will bring back the emotions of that Monday night, because it won't. It will serve as a reminder that on one Monday night, not only did a couple of great bands get together to honor New Orleans, they rallied America around the Superdome, and cranked it out. Get the song ... you won't be disappointed 
Not only is the song the best cover U2 has done in years, but the single (which also includes the live version from the Superdome) gives you both the Rick Rubin produced studio version and the aforementioned Superdome version. Buy it. It's VERY worth it 
what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians. It sounds like ESPN called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush 
U2 Green Day team up to give a rousing performance of The Skids "The Saints Are Coming". Both bands are punk rockers at heart and their version of the song is one of the best recordings of the year. Their performance at the reopening of the Super Dome was inspirational and the feeling emanates from the live recording. Sometimes when two major artists join forces, the results are less than spectacular, but that is not the case on this song 
Avenue Q breaks down all the hardships in life and lays them down allowing you to take into perspective and laugh at them. The show is an outrageous play on Sesame Street featuring an ethnically diverse cast including monsters obsessed by pornography to the dreaming school teacher. The cast does an absolutely fabulous job of portraying the characters. I highly recommend this soundtrack with reservations to those who take serious offense to comedy at the expense at all races, cultures, and occupations 
If you loved the play, you will love the CD. If you haven't been, go! It is not suitable for kids 
I loved the show when I saw it over 1 year ago. I don't know why it took me so long to purchase the CD. The music is great and holds lots of surprises for a "traditional" Broadway show lover. It's lots of fun. 
everyone I've played it for has enjoyed it. Just a lot of fu 
This CD is amazing, and has some of my favorite songs on it. I hope to see the broadway show sometime soon, but until then, this music will definately do. It has many hysterical numbers, such as "Schadenfreude," "Everyone's A Little Bit Racist," and "If You Were Gay." It also has some very sweet, beautiful songs, such as one of my favorites, "There's A Fine, Fine Line." I love this 
When telling people about this show, I usually use two turns of phrase: "Sesame Street... for adults," and "Rent, with muppets, and without HIV." Perfectly captures the "quarter-life crisis" experience 
What an excellent musical! It's really a lot different from what a lot of people are doing today. Although it hinges on an almost nonexistant plot, the episodes are excellently thought out and sensitively written. The lyrics are simply hillarious, not only because they make you feel really ackward, but also because they touch on situations that everyone has experienced in one form or another. I highly recommend this gem 
This is rude, crude, and extremely funny--just the song titles will tell you that much (Everyone's a Little Bit Racist, You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You're Making Love). However, if you don't plan on listening to this in the car with your toddler, it's fantastic! Plus, we have a personal reason for really enjoying it--one of the main characters is played by John Tartaglia, who also has a short on the Disney Channel. So, we've seen him working with muppets in a kid show, and now we've heard him playing a puppet who has sex in a song! It's too funny. Even if you don't know "Johnny and the Sprites," though, this is an extremely funny musical 
Great cast, great score! SO much better than this year's "Lousy" Chaperone! "Q" rules 
When does one sit down thinking about ideas that would make it on braodway, and come up with an x-rated puppet show? I dont know either but it happened and thank God it did. Avenue Q is so much fun (as long as you can take the crude language) But they dont hide that its in there so that shouldnt be a surprise. The Lyrics are wonderful. The songs are campy for the most part. The show deals with life and many different aspects of it. From hidden fantasies, to useless college degress, to racism, to, well, porn. Even if your not into broadway this would make a great addition to anyone comedy CD collection. If you are into musical theater you should definitly have this one. Enjoy! Favorite songs (other than the WHOLE THING): "Purpose" and "Everyones A Little Bit Racist 
This is the e.p. for all those who loved Iron and Wine's "The Creek Drank the Cradle," got hooked, and found themselves needing more. It's got almost an identical sound to that album, same lo-fi recording techniques, same dark-empty-church-in-a-Deep-Southern-forest type feel, but to me it feels even more hopeful, and even more peaceful. "The Sea And The Rhythm" is a beautiful song of love with hushed vocals that crash quietly like waves over sharp and hidden acoustic guitar. "The Night Descending" has a progressing, chugging feel, "Jesus The Mexican Boy" tells a touching story of a sad friendship, and "Someday The Waves" features what I think are the e.p.'s best lyrics, including the line, "Time like your cheek has turned for me." For those who loved "The Creek Drank the Cradle" but were disappointed by the slickness of Iron and Wine's more recent recordings, you need this e.p if you don't have it already. Buy it NOW 
I love Iron Wine's two LPs but I'm definitely of the opinion that singer/songwriter Sam Beam is at his best working with the EP format. He reminds me of those writers who can put down beautiful bits of short prose but whose novels invariably get a bit long-winded. The Sea the Rhythm and Woman King are his two best efforts thus far, both tight, succinct works that I always find enjoyable. The LPs always seem to run out of steam for me, despite having many essential songs. This follow-up to his debut contains the same lo-fi, 4-track-recorder-in-the-bedroom aesthetic, so if you're a stickler for sonic purity, try out Woman King instead 
I think this my first EP purchase ever - and I generally feel that, despite the quality many offer, EPs just are not worth it. Sam Beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind, as these apparent "outtakes" from The Creek Drank The Cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better. I only very recently discovered Iron and Wine through Our Endless Numbered Days, and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. The standout track to me is The Night Descending, it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past. The other four tracks are just as excellent though, and I think Sam's managed to make an avid fan out of me. Damn... and just when I thought there were no new artists to be excited about! 
i was a little apprehensive in buying this ep as it only has five songs, but this is just as incredible as TCDTC. 'jesus' is by no means bad or weak musically- it is some of the best story-telling i have heard in a song and isn't that what folk is about? if you want trendy and passe, atonal garbage, then do yourself a favor and buy the latest dunghill associated with conor oberst. however if you want relaxing, beautiful, melodic, and flat-out good acoustic genius, then iron and wine is just what you need 
I listen to this EP like it's my job. I don't remember bedtime without it. It fits the mood, it spends time with you, it calms your frazzled nerves and lets you know that everything will be okay again. It is an essential in your collection of mellow music. It is what downtempo was meant to be. It is literate, wise, simple, and, most important in the sparse-music genre, it is complete 
I'm with a couple of the other reviewers about Jesus the Mexican Boy, which is overlong and wouldn't be all that good even if a couple of verses had gotten lopped off. The first, second, and last songs are gorgeous. though, and the third song is fun ... Hardly junk like an apparently deaf customer called it, this EP is definitely worth it if you're a big fan, but the uninitiated would be better off starting with one of the full-length LP's 
Was really disappointed with this album. He needs to find something new that has the zip of Vincent, Crying American Pie. Old artists may need to just fade away if they are just a bunch of old men strumming boring new stuff. Bought this album because of the 3 songs that I mentioned. None of the rest made me want to listen more than once. 
Trying to gather a collection of songs together that can truly give an impression of such a diverse artist like Don McLean is not easy. Grammy Award winning Producer Joel Dorn has done just that with Reaview Mirror. He's captured the wonderful vocalist and interpreter of Songs , the Solo live concert artist , the concert artist with full band and strings , the folk singer and the blues singer. Don McLean is all of these - he's also a cowboy and Dorn has included to fine examples of McLean in cowboy mode. This CD is a gem - as a bonus it includes McLean's new single from his upcoming originals CD - plus a bonus DVD - this is value and well worth the price - as the album has just been released I ould doubt the reviewer who claims to have found it in a clearance bin - and doubt he even listed to it. Buy it its grea 
A lot of reviewers have commented that this album has a couple of good songs on it, and that the rest are just so-so at best. I disagree. Sure the first few songs are the best, so everything after seems to be a let down, but these are still very good songs. Anna Nalick has an exceptionally good voice. This is not regular radio drivel, nor is it 1-hit wonder material. It you enjoy lighter female singers - Tori Amos' and Fiona Apple's later stuff, Sarah McLachlan, etc - then you will probably like this CD. This CD may not be a 5 Star effort in many people's eyes, but I do believe that it shows that Anna Nalick has the potential to be a 5 Star artist. 
What can I say? It's catchy. At first I thought it was the lyrics (Breathe [2 a.m.]) that caught my attention, then I thought it was the rhythm and vocals (In the Rough), but after hearing the whole thing through and reading the liner notes I suspect the appeal at least partly due to production by Eric Rosse, who did Tori Amos' first two albums. Nalick isn't in Amos' class when it comes to composition and craftsmanship, but she's a helluva lot more accessible. The melodies are pretty pedestrian, verse/bridge/chorus, but all the hooks are in the right place and the instruments take a back seat to the lyrics, which are what introspective girl-pop are all about, right? I admit, at my first listen of the full album I felt I'd been snookered, because the lyrics were a bit more light and shallow than the first single "Breathe (2 a.m.)," which is definitely the darkest track here. But at least the words weren't embarrassing; Nalick wrote in just enough wryness and self-awareness to prevent triteness. And some of the songs are deeper than a nodding acquaintance reveals. "In My Head" is a simple but honest tribute to the music-hero worship we all do but don't like to admit: listening to that one song over and over again because it speaks to us so deeply. I've heard that Nalick broke into the pop world as a songwriter rather than a singer, so it's easy to imagine her taking inspiration from her muscial idols and then channelling that passion into her own songwriting. I can respect that. Basically this is a competent, if innocuous album. It's kind of like vanilla ice cream: not the most exciting or adventurous, but it's sweet, tasty, and goes down easy 
Love this CD, especially "Breathe." I listen to this when I'm mellow, driving in the car. The only song I don't like is the 2nd one; the name of it escapes me now 
Anna Nalick proves that in a world of Jessica Simpsons and Lindsay Lohans, you can come up with an album that showcases actual talent. Her voice is better than half the female artists' put togther. I got this album thinking it would be a Kelly Clarkson like rock album. I was surprised when i listened to it, but not disappointed. The songs are haunting and stick in your head. The slow songs are better than the fast ones. The best songs on the album are Breathe (2 AM), Catalyst, In My Head, In The Rough, Paper Bag and Bleed 
When I think of Anna Nalick, I think of the eclectic, heartfelt, moving songs, all collected together on one album. Anna truly has something for anyone. If you're one for a soft ballad, try "Forever Love (Digame)" and "In My Head". If you are more for alternative music that has real personality, then "Paper Bag", "In The Rough" and "Consider This" are right up your ally. If you want a touching song that really makes you think, I reccomend "Breathe(2AM)", "Wreck Of The Day" and "Catalyst". And if you want an energized, refreshing song try "Satellite" or "Citadel". As I said, Anna Nalick has something for everyone 
Anna Nalick IMO is the best artist in the 21st century. Her voice is so smooth and soothing and her vocals are personal and intense 
My favorite songs: Breathe (2AM), In My Head, Paper Bag, Consider This Disappointments: Wreck of the Day, Bleed An above averege CD. I would probably buy it just for Breathe (2AM) 
Nellie McKay is awesome. I love her singing style and her witty lyrics 
Who can resist the curiousity of listening to someone with such cheerful sounding music that is being compared to Eminem? That is how I first picked up her CD and sampled it at a store. I immediatley bought it and have not regretted that purchase. Nellie's music always makes me smile. The sunny sound pared with the outrageous lyrics create the perfect set of opposites. Whenever life makes me feel like I should follow some unwritten rule I pop her CD in and it reminds me that doing what is expected is not the only option. Some of her more mellow pieces for the new listener are: Manhatten Avenue, I Wanna Get Married, Suitcase Song Won't U Please B Nice. Just for fun, I like to mix a few of her songs into my playlist when I have company over - I find it amusing that people can be so impressed by the beautiful sonds and not pay enough attention to hear the crazy lyrics! This album really celebrates her abilities to create something refreshing and unique 
The best satirical songwriter since Dory Previn, but with far more musical variety, delightful pastiches of every style. This has become a classic on my shelf. Unlikely to be popular with white male republicans. 
great cd which incorporates many differenrt genres to have wholly entertaining sound. the lyrics of powerful and the whole cd is arrnaged delicately and effectively. haven't stopped listening to it for some time 
I've found myself listening to this more and more. She's bold and fun - sometimes it's in your face and other times more nuanced. Occasionally, she gets a little too clever, but that's to be expected from someone very smart but very young. You'll either love it or hate it. Give it a listen 
I worshipped Nellie at the Birchmere on 1/22 while she performed nearly everything on "Get away from me" intermixed with her new creations from Sony's unreleased "Pretty Little Head." Yes... I'm infatuated. Nellie is imperfect in nearly every category, but she fills so many categories - including irresistable sprite - that her shortcomings are not only over lookable, but trite in recitation. She's precocious, brilliant, charming, and a perfectionist that can't let a mistake go by without restarting a song in mid-concert. Watch this space... one day you will wish you kept that ticket-stub because it will trade for ungodly value when Nellie's trancendent talent matures and explodes like a Respectable Member of Society 
OK. I have to separate my opinion of Ms. McKay - she is a brat - with her musical ability. She is a good instrumental musician. She doesn't blow me away. Her approach to music, and near about everything else from what I can gather, is 'I like what I'm doing and that's the only opinion that counts.' OK. If you're not on a major label, yeah. If you don't care if people listen, yeah. But she IS on a major label, and she DOES care if people listen or she wouldn't be so stridently 'in your face' about her opinions. This goes back to 'she is a brat.' And unfortuantely, that spills over into her music in ways that are extremely off-putting to me. This record sounds great from a recording standpoint, but anyone can make a good-sounding record. However, it's so calculated that it has no real soul. It's more a commentary on McKay than it is on anything else. If she could rein in her ego and attitude, she might make a good session player, but if I never heard her sing another song she wrote, my heart wouldn't break. Perhaps the critics like her little schtick, but to me, it only reveals her immaturity. There are far better artists out there with less attitude and more ability. This record is as off-putting as her bratty attitude about nearly everything, as evidenced by the interviews she gives. I wouldn't waste my money on this one 
The one problem a record collector encounters when he has an album too many of one artist, is the tendency of the artist to sing the same songs in succeeding albums/settings. Feinstein, who I consider as the leading proponent in reviving the American Popular Song standards to its unfettered glory is backed by a philharmonic orchestra in this album with the musical direction of conductor Alan Broadbent. And yes, he sang some songs that were sung in sparse and acoustic settings in his previous albums. As usual, just like any cabaret singer who never really sings the same song twice (listen to the grand old dames of cabaret like Julie Wilson and Mabel Mercer), Feinstein delights in the varied ways he can see a song in different contexts. Having said that, I thought he was a bit overly cautious in exploring his rich bari-tenor (sorry for this oxymoron but that is the word to apply to his voice) in soaring the vocal lines of Kern's The Folks Who Live on the Hill. Other than that, he was at his wittiest and conversational (not to mention just plain beautiful) voice when singing I Won't Send Roses and he can revisit the Bernstein/Sondheim Somewhere without evoking the famous version of uber diva Barbra Streisand. If you like good crooning vocals in a grand and orchestral setting, this is the album to listen or give as a gift -- you/they won't regret it 
Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him 
Once Again, Michael Feinstein Has Recorded A Beautiful Romantic Cd. The Cd Features The Best Recording Of "LAURA" I Have Heard Since NANCY LAMOTT's Version. Michael Continues To Be One Of The Best Singers Of Our Time!! I Look Forward To All Future Recordings Hope That A Duet With The Fabulous Monica Mancini Will Be Coming Soon!!!! A Fan!!! 
There is not a single song in this album that is not definitive Feinstein. However, the mixing of Feinstein and the Israel Symphony orchestra leaves a lot to be desired. Several times, he's simply overwhelmed by the orchestra and is lost--leading to literal audio distortion 
Man, this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove. Just kidding I don't ride motorcycles, but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul. It can't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine, moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas 
I hate to start this review with a negative comment but it boils my blood when people give a two star review to this record because it's not up to par with Gentlemen or of all albums, Up In It. This is a band evolving, moving on...which alot of people have a problem dealing with. I don't think afghan whigs are making a record to please the fans they had in 93. This a genius record. Yes, Gentlemen was a turning point, but not a final nail in the the coffin. If you want repetition listen to ac/dc. The thing that made gentlemen so great was the things going on in that period of this mans life. You can't stay that angry forever. People grow up. 
This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded." THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way. The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
REALLY I GAVE THEM A FOUR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE CATALOG AND NOT BECAUSE OF THIS CD. THE CD BY ITSELF IS A 3 IN MY OPINION. REALLY DON'T NEED TO SAY A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WILL PROBABLY CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT ALLREADY LIKE THE WHIGS ANYWAY. THE MALLCORES AND EMO'S PROBABLY HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THESE GUYS. I THINK IT'S AMAZING HOW LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM HOW MUCH OF TODAYS RADIO PUKE HAS ELEMENTS OF THIS SOUND IN IT. MAKES YOU WONDER, WELL ATLEAST ME ANYWAY 
It's pretty obvious I think the Whigs are among the most underrated bands in rock history--otherwise, I wouldn't be writing this. After several albums mining such dark subjects chronicling love gone bad, addiction, murder, remorseful sex, and generally living the life of a modern American male Tarintino style, the boys are back with a collection of tracks that are, for a lack of a better term, light hearted. I mean, they're actually having fun here, without all that downer self-torture business (okay, maybe there's a bit of that, but it's way muted). Production values are high. Soulful background vocals, ballsy horns, and winning arrangements; this LP absolutely shines. I know I'm gonna take a lot of flak for the following closing comment, but honestly, this is the album the Rolling Stones _wish_ they recorded 
Popped this one back in the CD player after a few years off and was surprised how much I dug it. I usually pick 'Gentlemen' or 'Congregation' first when I need a Whigs fix. This is one where Dulli really sounds like he's enjoying being the lothario - I wish I was that cool! The "ass shake" line in 'Somethin' Hot' is one of the all time classics. Definitely the funkiest album in the Whigs catalog and a lot of fun listening to the Dulli swagger. An instruction manual on how to be the man 
"To some old boy who lived uptown who could afford it." That's my favorite Dulli lyric. This is the Whigs album that I've played the most over the years. Its good driving music. Perhaps its a bit less contemplative than prior albums, but I never really saw their cerebral side as one of their strengths. I'd say 1965 has more of a modern RnB/soul feel to it than their other albums, particularly because of the stripped down, hip-hop style drumming throughout. Also, Dulli takes it down a bit with the vocals, instead of straining to squeeze out every last belligerent howl he can muster. "You might be right, you might be everything that you said that you were/so baby, don't make me worry about you..." he muses on the track "Slide Song", maneuvering his voice deftly into that space that's sort of halfway between a full-throated belt-out and a whispery croon. I was a big fan of "Congregation" and less so of "Gentleman". By the time "Black Love" came out, I'd sort of had my fill of the Afghan Whigs. It was 1965 that brought me back into the fold. This is the one that will probably continue to be my favorite 
Alright, some fans fall into the "Gentlemen" camp, and it's certainly a classic album - consistently good songs all the way through, Greg Dulli in perfect self-loathing form, etcetera. Others fall into the "Black Love" camp because it's a fantastically dark, if overblown, caricature of Greg Dulli's persona - menacing, pleading, hypersexualized, and excruciatingly out of key. "Congregation" is a worthy choice as well, the grittiest and grungiest of them all, not to mention the near-perfect "Jesus Christ Superstar" cover. I love all of these albums, but "1965" is the one that I pop into the CD player most frequently. The lyrics seem a bit trite compared to the brooding "Black Love" and desperate "Gentlemen" - an acquaintance of mine, whom I forced to listen to "1965," called it a "40-minute pick-up line," which probably isn't far from the truth. But frankly, I couldn't care less, because this album has that indescribable groove that compels you to shake your ass and sing along. Many musical elements absent in past Whigs recordings - the sultry female backup singers, screeching horns, all products of the New Orleans backdrop - shine through in "1965" and help Greg Dulli effortlessly channel the soul, funk, and R that came so naturally to the "Uptown Avondale" EP but were forcibly and often awkwardly incorporated into the "Black Love" recording sessions. Words can only describe these intangible feelings so much. Just listen to the album and wait for those moments of transcendence, like the soaring chorus to "Uptown Again," or when the female vocalist coos alongside the mantra "I've got the Devil in me, girl" on "John the Baptist," or Greg Dulli's anguished "yeah, yeah, yeah" as his voice drowns amidst the squealing horns and careening guitars in the final minute of "Omerta." There's nothing like 'em on any of the other Whigs releases, and that's why "1965" is their standout record 
The Afghan Whigs are America's greatest rock and roll gift to music. Aside from being from Cincinnati (let's not hold that against them) Greg Dulli is a master songwriter. He writes from the place deep down within oneself where everything is hidden. Where you would not tell your closest loved one your deep dark dirty secrets. With that being said the one thing that always held the Whigs back is the sad simple fact that our boy Dulli can't sing a lick. I am a huge Whigs fan for many years and have come to that conclusion a few years ago. What makes the Whigs great is the pure emotion and energy that goes into the songs which have always been in top form and go into the stratosphere on 1965. "Crazy" might as well be tattooed Greg's forehead, for that's what he is. "66" is the greatest love song ever told. I could rave about this CD for hours but I will not. All I can say about 1965 is to buy it, spend sometime with it. Really listen to the music and lyrics and I believe that it will touch you in ways no band ever had. I take this CD everywhere and tell anyone who will listen about it.   
ROCK INDEED! This CD is great; when I first rec'd it I played it while I cleaned my house. Time and work breezed by as I enjoyed the music. Perfect; not loud and overwhelming yet not to soft. I love it. I've also played it while entertaining guest; everybody loved it. Although I already had the Lover's Live DVD, I had to sit in front of the TV to fully enjoy it. The CD allowed me to do other things while still enjoying the music 
This is my favorite album period. I have to admit that I am not too high up on Sade's first albums, But this one takes it. I think everybody that listens to the crap that is coming out now, needs to get a reality check and listen to the real. Alicia Keys......Yeah whatever.She can't hold a match compared to Sade. I just wish another album would come out. There is nothing lost in this album. And jeez, can Sade be any finer. The most gorgeous woman on the planet, with the best voice 
For all of you that may have thought I only panned dance compilations, get ready to feast your eyes on this review. I have been a fan of Sade since God was a boy. Her music, although viewed by many as simple, has more soul than just about anything you can hear on television or radio. Instruments used to deliver her mood ebb and flow like a gentle tide against a moonlit beach. One of her many talents is that she never feels the need to "kill" her songs with overblown meaningless orchestrations. I loved every track on this CD; however, my favorite is "Somebody Already Broke My Heart". "I've been torn apart so many times. I've been hurt so many times before. So, be careful and be kind." I'm sure that just about every person who would listen to those lyrics could relate because if you've ever been in love, well...you get the idea. Kudos to you, Sade. In a time where most music is souless, uninspired, and insipid, you are definitely a breath of fresh air. 
It seems like Sade blesses us with her melodic stylings every 8 years or so, but her music is always memorable, and touches the deepest confines of my emotions and soul (it's definately not pop music). I had the pleasure of seeing Sade live at Jones Beach years ago, she performs barefoot and appeared to be in her natural element on the beach, this all made the experience all the more sensuous, my date and I loved it. That whole night seemed on the verge of a major downpour, and this venue has no rain cover, needless to say this enchantingly beautiful lady and her music, kept the inclimate weather at bay, all night long, just providing a cool mist to keep us refreshed. I guess Sade has been catogorized as a contemporary jazz artist but her music transcends normal parameters of classification. I put this CD on when I need spiritual healing. I just kick back with the headphones in effect and listen to track 7 "The Sweetest Gift" (dedicated to her child) and track 11 "It's Only Love That Gets You Through" over and over and over again. Track 1 "By Your Side" was the first song released after an excruciating long hiatus (8yrs), it was a hit immediately. I hope and pray that we don't have to wait much longer for this true musical angel's, return. 
i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it 
Sade is a band, it is not a female singer. Sade was one of the biggest brittish groups of the mid-80's. Their jazz-pop sound made them stars and 'Diamond Life' was one of the best selling records in the UK for many years. Sade's discography can be described in chapters. The Jazz-pop chapter which includes the albums 'Diamond Life' and the masterpiece 'Promise'. Then we have the 'World Music' chapter. 'Stronger than Pride' has many spanish influences and latin american influences. also some reggae rythms can be traced.(Sade Adu lived for some time in Spain and married a spaniard). 'Love Deluxe' has an american r b and rock influence within a brittish "trip-hop" frame (this has been their biggest album in the US). 'Lover's Rock' is a different album. It is not a jazz-pop album and it does not have the signature sound of 'Love Deluxe'(no electric guitars or strong drum machines). 'Lover's rock' is a mellow album with soft reggae and chill style sounds. It has a 'Lounge-chill' texture that is so popular in europe (there are many lounge -chill albums in the market and others like Bjork's Vespertine album follow this european music trend). This is a great album, the best since 'Stronger than Pride' 
Absolutely great! Another album from SAde that you shouldn't miss. Flow, All about our love, and The sweetest gift are my favourite! Can't stop listening to it. She just knows how to make me feel so good 
Lovers Rock is one of the most greatest albums you'll ever come across. It hits a spot in your soul, and you can't help but feel the words, rhythm, and the beat. Sade is just that good. Whenever I listen to this album, it's always on repeat. I wish that she would bless us with another great CD because I've been hungry for more for quite some time now 
Released in 2000, this album has come in many different options. The original album, which is this CD, has 11 songs and is 44 minutes long. Also available is a Lovers Rock CD with some bonus live tracks on the disc. There is also two disc option, with the original Lovers Rock CD, and a bonus CD of a few live tracks. Lovers Rock is also included as a bonus CD in the DVD Lovers Live (which comes in a standard DVD case). The best value is to get the Lovers Rock CD with the bonus Lovers Live DVD in the standard jewel case. Confusing? THIS CD DOES NOT MAKE THE MOST OF SADE'S VOICE OR SONG WRITING. This is really a stark, stripped down sound for Sade, especially when you compare it to her early work. Seven of the tracks are driven by muted electronic rhythms and a muffled background music. I don't think the sound works well with Sade's vocal style. She sings flat and without emotion. All seven of these tracks sound alike and the CD gets boring and monotonous. The songs that are good are where she drops the electronic rhythms and lets the emotion of her voice come through, or where she livens up and starts to rock. On The Sweetest Gift and It's Only Love That Gets You Through, Sade sings to almost no accompanyment. Here she sings in a great jazz/blues style and really lets the emotion of her voice come through. King of Sorrow and Immigrant are a little more upbeat rockers. (they are not really rockers, but do rock when you compare to the other tracks on the CD). Here she sings with more energy and variation. So, if she is the King of Sorrow, I think I might consider turning gay 
With Stanley Road Paul Weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days. He hasn't written 12 good songs, instead, he's written one great album. A factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song, making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them. A mostly guitar driven album, Weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics, often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song, which gladly and competently carries the album along. However, there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel. Though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones, they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that, not only are they a nice change of direction, but also they effortlessly fit in. Stand-out songs are 'you do something to me', 'broken stones', 'the changing man', 'I walk on gilded splinters' and of course the title track. To truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end. It far outweighs the sum of its parts, and as these parts are so good, you're in for a great journey. 
I had written Paul Weller off after subpar outings with the Style Council. After the urging of a friend, he persuaded me to pick up this title. After listening to this, I realized Paul Weller going back to his roots with The Jam. Although it is much more mature than his old school days, I enjoyed this outing very much. His writing style has come back with some middle aged anger which made me very pleased. Fans will not be disappointed 
This album is top quality stuff. A fine blend of natural talented writing and top drawer session musicians. Stevie Winwood and Noel Gallagher (Oasis). H from Grappenhall, Warrington, England 
Beginning with the superb hooks in The Changingman, Paul Weller does not let us down. Featuring one of the finest ballads to come out of England since McCartney still had a moptop ; You Do Something To Me. Stanley Rd is a must for fans of "real" Brit pop. A Masterpiec 
First of all, I'm not a super major Feeder fan. I've only heard "Polythene" and "Yesterday Went Too Soon" and liked Yesterday better. That being said, "Echo Park" is the best of those three. This album is solid from beginning to end. I had a hard time picking a favorite tune. In fact, it was one of the best albums I've heard since Embrace's "Out of Nothing." It's one of those just-push-play kind of albums. The content and form of each song is fitting: the rockers kick, and the ballads were true to themselves, not wimpy or contrived. Check out: Satellite News, Piece by Piece, Turn, Seven Days..., and Under the Weather for a good sampling. Buy this and let your friends borrow it 
This is the most fantastic album i have ever heard. i don't think I truely appreciated music until I first heard Feeder! They really are amazing and this album completely showcases them. Every song is great in its own way and it's so difficult to chose a favourite because of this. There are 'happy' songs like Buck Rodgers and Seven Days in the Sun which make you want to leap around playing air guitar and more mellow ones like Turn and Oxygen that are great at making you reflect on life. if you don't listen to it you are really missing out 
A brilliant album from one of the best British rock (indie rock) bands. This album has everything a great album should have and more, it is truly a masterpiece. The song Buck Rogers was absolutely huge in the UK and really helped to promote and sell the album, fortunately that was the only single to be hugely overplayed. Every song is absolutely superb, especially We can't rewind and Turn, which in my opinion are two of the best Feeder songs. Anyone's music collection that doesn't contain this cd is incomplete. Feeder ROCK!! especially echo park 
This is a great album and i recommend it to any one. People who like hard rock, people who like soft rock, and people who like pop rock, will love this album... I'm glad i found out about the band, because they make some great music. I thoroughly recommend buying this album 
This is a truly great album. This album should not be negatively critisized. It is very unique, original, unlike nothing I've heard before. The band just received a gold record for echo park and they will receive one for yesterday went too soon...... They are a remarkable band...... 
This cd is awesome and very up beat. I believe it is an album for a wide variety of people. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes up beat music. 
Confession - I can't STAND rap. The albums artwork, and the accompanying rap selections ... and explicit lyrics ... hides some INCREDIBLE talent. Today, rap stars capture a narrow, decidely controversial market ... and Rihanna simply doesn't fit this mold. She reminds me of the amazing talents of Amy Winehouse, another teenager whose voice almost captures the sounds of Aretha Franklin. When comparing the EVER so catchy SOS, and then comparing it to the dichotomy track A Million Miles Away. Wow! It's SO rare to able to choose a single artist on the iPod to get one through both lullaby moments and rock / disco ... sort of reminds me of the rock and roll of Rod Stewart and his Great American Songbook. I actually asked the dentist the other day to change the CD from Barry (don't ask which one - hint M) to SOS to get my root canal done in double time, then finish me off with A Girl Like Me. Worked magic! Together with my other favourite artists, Dido, Deep Purple, Rihanna is a WONDERFUL find. I just HOPE she continues to produce heartfelt ballads and not rap. Oddly, Dido also got a "helping hand", NOT that she needed it, from Eminem. Another contrast! Go Rihanna, GO GIRL!!!! 
One of the biggest surprises for me actually this year in terms of music. I mean we had some great offerings like Christina's Back to Basics, Nelly Furtado's Loose, and John Mayer's Continuum(also include India Arie, Mary J Blige, and Bob Dylan). And then we had some disappointments like Beyonce's BDay (come on now and JT -to his fans- is not impressing me either with "Sexyback"). And in terms of new artists the only ones that I had liked was Natasha Bedingfield, Chris Brown (my adolescent relatives got me hooked on that), and Carrie Underwood (yeah you read it!). The reason I'm throwing out names is because Rihanna the artist behind "Pon De Replay" was the last person recently I expected to make a good album, because in some cases I was right before (Ciara being an example for me). But in Rihanna's case I totally misjudged and was glad to have listened to the album. What I love most is the variety of songs in terms of genre (rock, pop, hip/hop, island, r). You'd think after listening to "SOS" it would sound all alike and then you're hit with the next two tracks sounding so different and yet good. This was not something you would expect considering her first island-dance album that failed to hit platinum. The album's production is very polished (another surprise) and enjoyable. Now Rihanna isn't the best singer but she knows her limits and tries to stay within them (unlike some artists who I will not name). I'd recommend it but it isn't for everybody. But it is fun and entertaining music 
I don't really feel like writing a lot but I do want to say that I love this album. I was very skeptical about a Rihanna album. I didn't buy her first one because I figured all her songs would sound like "Mr. DJ". I wasn't going to buy this one because i assumed all her songs would sound like SOS (I liked SOS, but I don't want to hear it over and over again). Unfaithful, Girl Like Me, this album is hot! Rihanna did her thing 
The Fray's sound is nothing particularly knew. Lifehouse and Switchfoot did it before (and possibly better), but, nevertheless, How To Save A Life is a strong debut for this group. The lead singles "Over My Head (Cable Car)" and "How To Save A Life" are great tracks and there are several other strong tracks on the album, including "All At Once," "Dead Wrong," and "Fall Away." If you enjoy easy listening music from a talented group, give this album a chance 
I only enjoyed one song. The one they always play on the radio. How disappointed I was to pay a high price to just enjoy ONE song. 
If you are looking for some great new tunes, this is the cd you should check out! Awesome 
I had no problems with my order, it came quickly and in great shape and I just love the CD 
I do not understand how the Amazon.com reviewer could downplay this wonderful band. They are the best thing to come out in America in a long time. Their songs have so much meaning and depth of emotion you cannot just throw them to the wayside. I just attended their concert at the House of Blues New Orleans this past Saturday and I heard some new songs they had written along with the most popular songs from this album......and they were all amazing. When Isaac Slade sand "Look After You" and "Heaven Forbid", it brought me to tears. I believe this album should be looked at as having all the songs be the same melodically--because they are not!!--but be looked at as being one of the rare albums that come out where you can enjoy the whole cd all the way through and recognize the emotion that went into it and the brilliance in music that The Fray brings. "How to Save a Life" is my most favorite album and song---it reminds me of my late mother and what she did for me. I thank The Fray for bringing good memories to my mind and lots of hope........I love them and they have saved my life. 
My daughter listens to this cd alllll the time! I think she only watches Gray's Anatamy to hear them sing sometimes! Even I like to hear this cd and I'm 53! LO 
Everything went smoothly for this purchase and I have really enjoyed the CD. It is one of my most favorites ones and I highly recommend it to everyone! Thank Yo 
Fray seems to be the new hype especially because of Gray's Anatomy, but I found them before they were the hype and they are still great. It is a great album and the piano makes it quite different from other comparable albums 
How to describe The Fray? Well, they're a piano-pop group, so I ought to compare them to other piano-pop artists. Let's see. Think Coldplay without the atmospherics, Mae without the blissful melodies, Ben Folds Five without the wit and swagger. Essentially, remove any elements of other piano-driven groups that make them remotely enjoyable, and you have The Fray. There's so little here to describe that this album is nearly impossible to review. Song after song of lyrics so generic that every teenager in the country will believe they were written just for them, piano parts that meander aimlessly, and vocals pitched a quarter tone flat. Don't be mislead by the claim that there are one or two great songs on here - the singles are indistinguishable from the rest of the album. It's mind-boggling that a band can manage to display so little personality over the course of 45 minutes. The piano is not a gimmick, but neither does it actually establish any command over these monotonous skeletons of songs. The record isn't unlistenable so much as it is pointless. Coldplay and Keane often compensate for subpar songwriting by achieving voluminous sounds. The Fray can't even manage that, insisting on remaining timid and gentle, but with closed facelessness, not profound vulnerability. And that album title. Probably the worst name for a record since "Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. 
Great recording of one of the greats. The original is now difficult to listen to due to the tinny sound and mono recording. this revival was wonderful, with a great cast and now a definitive, excellent recording. Skip the movie soundtrack 
Drats ! I can't believe I let myself miss this revival... If the stage production was as good as the cast recording I can only say that I really hope that the chaps in Great Britain who are currently rehearsing up the latest revival are on up on their jippers (or whatever they call them) on this one... (Actually the New York dialect doesn't seem so authentic on this one... strange... guess Gulliani really did clean up Time Square...) The orchestration on this is swinging... And it better be... IF I WERE A BELL, LUCK BE A LADY and I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE have been major entries in the GREAT AMERICAN JAZZ SONG BOOK since the musical came out... in fact, as many versions of IF I WERE A BELL that I've had to sit and play through, I have to say that the big band swinging Entr'Act version is really boppin' ... and the decision to take the REPRISE of GUYS AND DOLLS uptempo makes the CD even more must have. As for performances, while I think in many ways the score out-tops the cast, its still fun to listen to, overall its good enough to warrent listen after listen after listen from this BROADWAY and JAZZ FANATIC, and SIT DOWN YOU'RE ROCKIN THE BOAT is still the unforgettable showstopper it was the first time I experienced this music. Now - - I know this comment might be off the wall, but I wonder if some of the other great writings of Damon Runyon will ever hit the stage hencefoith ? And is it just me, but despite some great new musicals on Broadway this season, there is still a greater need for more revivals. 
What a treat this CD was, I've never been a huge fan of musicals' but I always had a soft spot for the film with Brando and Sinatra. This, however, was a revelation for me. The music seemed new, the singing was crisp and spirited, packed full of comedy and pathos. The sound quality - excellent, just put this on, sit back and submerge yourself into Runyons' world. 
My only real frame of reference is the movie with Sinatra and Brando. Maybe not the best to campare with, even so I have to say that, with the exception of Nathan Lane and Faith Prince, the performances on the CD lacked the life I would have expected. Maybe it's the effect he was going for as the suave, worldly gambler, but Peter Gallagher's Sky Masterson just came across as bored. His voice was also not the quality I would have expected from a Broadway-caliber performer. I almost hate to admit it, but I even prefer Brando's rendition of "Luck be a Lady" over the one on this CD. The movie version of "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" was also far superior. Some of "Sky's" songs (complete songs, not snippets/samples) can also be found at Peter Gallagher's web site. I found the CD at my local library, so I avoided having to pay for the disappointment. I would recommend you try to borrow a copy before deciding whether it's actually worth buying 
I love the "Guys and Dolls" music, and this is a great recording. Faith Prince is a divinely perfect Adelaide; Peter Gallagher comes as close as humanly possible to perfect as Sky. Nathan Lane, unfortunately, has been ruined for me by being the voice of "Timon" in "The Lion King," but he's an excellent Nathan Detroit. The entire cast is very good, although I was a little disappointed with "More I Cannot Wish You," except for Josie de Guzman. She's a great singer, and she hits all the high notes, but she doesn't bring out the warmth in Sarah's character. Every spoken line she delivers sounds harsh, and her "I'll Know" sounds more like a checklist than a daydreaming girl. Her worst offense, though, is "If I Were a Bell," a truly great, comical song sung by Sarah when she's drunk in Havana. Instead of sounding lusty, drunk, and spontaneous, she sings it sweetly and note-perfectly; there's no character. "I've Never Been in Love Before," though, and "Marry the Man Today" are both fine, and "Sue Me" is just terrific. I really like the two Sky songs--"My Time of Day" and "Luck Be a Lady"--because Peter Gallagher is a fantastic tenor, and they're just beautiful. Overall, a really fun soundtrack, but I still think that Sarah was miscast 
This recording is definitely the best I have seen done for this musical. I know from personal experience portraying the role of Sarah Brown that this musical is a hit with audiences due to the up-tempo nature of the musical. The speed of some of the songs kept everything flowing and preventing a lag in an otherwise long musical. This recording is what my director used to base our tone and speed on, and I applaude her for it. The voices and performances on this recording are spectacular! Bravo 
Hi, I am currently doing a production of Guys and Dolls, playing Nicely-Nicely, and I decided to do some research on the various recordings of this show. This 1992 Revival Recording is fantastic, and a fun recording to listen to. The tempos of all of the songs are bright, fun, colorful and really breathe some life into the songs. The overall performances given on this disc are excellent as well...Nathan Lane makes a funny, and charming Nathan Detroit - one can see why Adelaide would put up with his nonsense for 14 years.....Faith Prince keeping with the tradition of nasal Adelaides with the Brooklyn accent does an excellent job here of portraying Adelaide with impeccable comic timing, and belt that can reach the back of any large Broadway house. Her "Adelaide's Lament" was a treat. Peter Gallagher and Josie De Guzman do a wonderful job here, although they are not the best Sky and Sarah I have heard, or seen. Walter Bobbie's characterization of Nicely-Nicely is just adorable and warm, and he does an incredible job on whatever number Nicely has to sing. J.K. Simmons was hilarious as well, with great comic timing. I only give this recording 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that sometimes some of the tempos were TOO rushed, to the extent that some of the clever lyrics might be overlooked and compromised, and a lot of the score has been drastically changed, when they didn't need any changes at all - "Runyonland", and "Sit Down You're Rockin' The Boat" are a couple that come to mind immediately. I think Frank Loesser's score was good enough with out the changes and embellishings that were added to the score for this production. I would recommend this recording just for the fun of it, but if I were doing a production of this, and wanted to hear an accurate representation of the score, or if I were doing research on this musical, I would either go with the Original Broadway Cast, or the 1995 Complete Recording with Kim Criswell, Don Stephenson and Emily Loesser. Both, especially the latter, give an excellent representation of how the score was initially conceptualized and represented. And how perfect it was, and still is 
This is probably one of the best Broadway revival soundtracks ever recorded. It truely captures the excitement and humor of a live performance. It's as if they're on the stage performing the show with microphones hanging all over the place capturing a classic performance than in a recording booth with them belting out songs. The biggest strength of this soundtrack is in the vocal characterizations as well the great atmospheric orchestrations. The casting was pure perfection. Nathan Lane, Faith Chance and Peter Gallagher are all in top form and you'd think they were all born to play their parts. Since this play has been performed in High Schools and community theaters for years, this soundtrack as well as the Broadway run had to distinguish itself from the amateur/semi-pro shows with such performances that would make it the definitive version. I think this soundtrack has acheived that and more. I'd buy this version over any other version any day. 
I know that the reviewer right before me gave this 1 star and called it "the worst drivel he'd ever heard". Before you allow this to sway you, look at his other reviews. This is a guy who's favorite band seems to be Chicago. Also, it would appear that he has purchased more than one box set of the TV show "Frasier". Take a negative review by this guy as a sign that the "Showtunes" album might well be excellent. Stephen Merritt might be a little too adventurous for someone who's brain has been turned to pudding by the blandness of Chicago and Blood, Sweat Tears 
This album exemplifies the relentless self-absorption and boredom of performance art. I would never voluntarily buy anything else produced by this man. It is artless, stupid and monotonic. Did I forget to mention self-pitying and annoying? If you want to ruin your day, buy this CD and listen to it first thing in the morning 
Stephin Merritt has created another imaginative work with "Showtunes" in his 26-track CD. I've listened to it several times on my commute to and from work, and I'm not quite sure why one of the reviewers object to his absent voice. His other musical enterprises - 6ths, Future Bible Heroes, Magnetic Fields - don't always have him front-and-center. What he brings to us with "Showtunes" is more of his clever lyrics and catchy tunes. One track is especially remarkable - "Hail, Son of Heaven". It sounds to me like the Iraq War Anthem. You could read a bit of political intrigue into "Showtunes" lyrics, but hey, why bother? Just enjoy the opera excerpts and the liner notes. Why did I rate it with only four stars rather than a full five? His capolavoro, "69 Love Songs" (the three-disc set), has everything I want in a funny, clever, and touching entertainment package and gets the full five stars in my book 
I'll be brief. I was shocked to see that the only review yet posted for Stephin Merritt's Showtunes was such a bad review, giving an insulting two stars. I can't see anyone who really likes Merritt's body of work not liking this album since it is full of his trademark melodies and clever lyrics. The previous reviewer complained that Merritt doesn't sing on any of the tracks, but he doesn't sing on about a third of his material (Future Bible Heroes, The 6ths, the first two Magnetic Fields and a sizable chunk of 69 Love Songs), so this is nothing new. I can understand if some people may feel the singing is too melodrmatic or mannered, but it fits with the nature of the songs and it's fun. And speaking of the songs, they are presented in a fragmented, seemlingly random order which, of course, makes it impossible to follow the story lines. Nevertheless, I agree with whoever's decision to do this since it emphasizes the music and makes this collection more albumish. Bottom line, this is the best Stephin Merritt release since 69 Love Songs. (Also, the full recordings of the three musicals can be purchased from that most famous of online download stores. 
The curiously gifted songwriter Stephin Merritt is best known as the guiding force behind several acclaimed indie-pop groups -- most notably The Magnetic Fields, who amazed, delighted, and sort of overwhelmed us all with the three CD collection 69 Love Songs (and then followed up with the underwhelming album i.) Over the past few years, Mr. Merritt has also written songs for three music theater productions by Chen Shi-Zheng, and Showtunes is jam-packed with 26 of them. These tunes encompass everything you love (or perhaps don't?) about Stephin's songwriting -- they are clever and witty, compact and concise, tuneful and cloying... and a bit precious at times. There's one major problem however -- Stephin isn't singing any of them. Instead, the Showtunes are (appropriately, I guess) performed by vocalists and choruses from "the original casts" in a mannered, over-enunciated, Broadway-esque style that sounds more like Gilbert Sullivan than The Magnetic Fields. And sadly, I couldn't stand it. Maybe listeners more enamored of musical theater than I am would not be as distracted by this (I can't stomach Cole Porter songs sung this way either.) Besides, the arrangements are fantastic, using unconventional ensembles that convincingly blend Asian instruments with lute, autoharp, accordian, marimba, and steel drums -- thankfully without the electronic clutter that sometimes intrudes upon Magnetic Fields productions. (Happily, a few instrumental selections are sprinkled throughout the CD.) But unfortunately, all I could think about while listening to Showtunes was how much better these songs would sound if they were sung by Merritt's soulful, resonant, unpretentious baritone voice instead. And I suspect that many of his other fans will feel the same way, hoping as I do that Stephin has worked through this musical theater phase once and for all. In the future, if he combines the formidable songwriting and orchestration skills heard on Showtunes with the sincere and direct vocal performances that graced so many of the 69 Love Songs, I expect to be amazed and delighted by Stehpin Merritt again and again. Meanwhile, be forewarned: The Magnetic Fields meets The Mikado may not be your cup of Oolong tea 
i loved it...especially liked blitzkreig bop; check it out if you dont own it already 
The Ramones are one of my favorite bands. I just love them to death. Joey Ramone has got to be one of my favorite singers of all time. Johnny Ramone can turn 3 or 4 power chords into a masterpeice. For a while, I only had Ramones Mania to my disposal, so I knew I had to get more. So I started my Ramones album collection with The Ramones S/T. Is this a bad record? You bet your furry purple buttocks it aint! In fact, it is a very good record. And like Leave Home, Rocket To Russia, and Road To Ruin, it really shows us what punk is supposed to sound like. But there's just something about this record that makes it not as good as the next 3. It's probably the fact that the guitar sounds are in one speaker and the bass is in the other. It's not a national tragedy, but it makes the guitars just sound like a bunch of noise, which mean that I usually just hear the bass. Plus, I don't think Joey's voice is quite as good as next releases. Don't get me wrong, I still love it. It just didn't quite get perfected until later. Aside from these issues, this is a freaking awesome album, and I still enjoy it. My favorites are Blitzkreig Bop(single version), Judy Is A Punk(OMG such a great one; one of my favorite Ramones songs!), I Wanna Be your Boyfriend(yeah, immature, but still very good), Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement, Let's Dance, and Today Your Love Tomorrow The World. And the only one that I absolutely cannot stand is I Don't Care. Although The Ramones' sound got much stronger on their later records, this is still essential to all punk rockers out there. Awesome record 
The Ramones what can i say? Greatest band ever? Maybe not but pretty darn close.For all those to stuck up to like the ramones because the poor production and lack of fast guitar solos are really missing. The Ramones were born on 50's bubblegum and the new york dolls the stones and beatles. If you are new to The ramones i recommend not starting with this album because you might be turned off cause lack of audio quality. Try A greatest hits or Rocket to russia, road to ruin, End Of the Century, Brain drain, or pleasant dreams. The Ramones debut is a great great album really what rock n roll should be about not 30 minute drum solos 
Frist of all this is an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams 
When this debut album by the RAMONES came out in 1976, it was perhaps the most revolutionary rock album since the BEATLES White Album. It was certainly the most original and influential album of the late 1970's and possibly more so than anything that has been released since then. Some might be skeptical of my first paragraph, until you realize that the RAMONES (and this album) didn't just introduce the no-holds barred, autobahn fast, three chord punk rock genre to the world; but the RAMONES also influenced the creation of new branches of heavy metal - namely, speed and thrash metal. And their influence didn't just stop there: In the early and mid-80's us goths were into bands like Depeche Mode, the Smiths, Joy Division, The Cure, Bauhaus, Love and Rockets, etc....all of us ALSO wore RAMONES shirts, we loved the Ramones, and we still do. Robert Smith of the Cure and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode have both worn RAMONES shirts onstage and cite them as influences. This is in no small part due to their lyrics being so dark and reflective of teen alienation with society. The sadly deceased Johnny Ramone would probably roll over in his grave if he knew that he and his band were being lumped into the same category with those goth bands that I just named....but...sorry Johnny, your band will always be one of our favorites. Is this a "heavy metal" album (or band) as some reviewers below say? Well, I remember that they opened for Black Sabbath back in the 70's not long after this album came out. After a few minutes, the audience of metal hippies threw bottles and other trash at the Ramones, and ran them off the stage. Apparently, metal fans at that time were partial to these slow, drawn out, twenty minute songs with the long wanky guitar solos. The Ramones (whose songs on this album all clocked in under three minutes, and around only two) didn't buy into this, so the Ramones musical style as opposed to the heavy metal of the 70's was much different (though, again, they would influence many later heavy metal genres and bands....metal bands like Motorhead, Slayer, Metallica, Guns N Roses, Anthrax, and many other bands cite the Ramones as huge influences). So, the Ramones "metal?" Well, all I can say is that if it floats your boat then call them what you want...hell, if calling the Ramones a metal band will make you like the band and buy their albums (esp. this one), then you can call em' a polka band, a jazz band, whatever for all I care. Just buy this record, you won't regret it. My personal opinion? The Ramones not only hold the patent on punk rock, they were punk rock back in the days when "punk" meant something more than overpriced Hot Topic shirts from the shopping mall or car pool rides to Good Charlotte concerts with your mom and little sister. Oy Vay. Enjoy this album.  
The Ramones aren't a punk band. They are a hard rock heavy metal band. And all the songs on this album are heavy metal style. Joey Ramone still sings the same voice though Johnny Ramone plays electric heavy metal guitar. The Ramones were always a rock and roll band 
So I bought this album about 2 years ago and hated it. Talentless, overrated, sophomoric, and juvenile would have been words I might have used to describe the Ramones. Then about a year later something in my head snapped, and I realized just how impressive and important this album is. It's not just amazing for historical value, but shamelessly enjoyable and life affirming... even if the subject matter is pretty nihilistic at it's core (solvent abuse, prostitution, murder by chainsaw). Somehow Joey can sing about even the most depressing subjects and make you want to sing along not for catharisis, but just for pure enjoyment! I dont know if they were really punk... upon first listen, I thought more of a juvenile and visceral Beach Boys. Classic rock, sort of like those "Nuggets" bands, but just way better. When I heard they covered Surfin' Bird and California Sun everything just made sense all of a sudden. The Ramones reminded people again in those days of what was cool about Rock Roll. Two chords (MAYBE three), or better yet 1 chord, a catchy chorus and a whole lot of distortion. Sure, they're lo-fi and by most conceptions of art appreciation they're just TERRIBLE, but that's also what makes them cool. At the same time, the Ramones "shtick" doesn't sound calculated or forced. My initial ignorance to the genius of this band completely bears out the course of their career. Don't feel sorry for them though... history will be kind to the Ramones 
First off I think it's so funny how you all say there is a curse word in 'Let Go'....LOL!Ofcourse most of you are alot younger than me,me being 18.But I do think it is poor taste of Vanessa swearing,knowing millions of kids will be buying this record.But she's just expressing herself. The album is ok..She doesn't have this amazing voice but it is sweet and sincere..I like that she didn't do a "Disney" album and kinda ran away from that(Which is why alot of reviews are bad on here...they liked her in HSM...and I didn't!Kids movie,lol....so I give the album 4 stars.. There are a few songs that are just annoying but there are some hits like 'Say Ok' which is the best song in my opinion 
We liked Vanessa in High School Musical, so got this CD for my two tweens. It was a huge disappointment. Her voice just isn't that good and the songwriting is pretty lame. I finally took it out of our car CD player because the singing is so bad. She makes Hilary Duff look really good 
What is this garbage? Manufactured trash by Disney Channel is reaching the apex of my nerves. First of all, I was impressed with Vanessa's performance on the Disney Channel hit "High School Musical" but that's about as good as it gets for her. None of these songs are good, it's all been done before. Her voice is digitally enhanced to the point where she sounds like a robot half of the song! A little bit of enhancement is acceptable, but not to this extent. I really don't think anybody will be able to relate to this music. She has a rather mediocre voice, nothing spectaucular. Wouldn't waste your money on this one 
I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to "Hounds of Love," but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this 
Kate fans should buy this CD because it is a masterpiece. People unacquainted with Kate Bush should buy it so they will know what brilliance and unabashed creativity really is. Aside from that, all I can say is, Thanks, Kate. Your spirit is something I hope we will enjoy for many years to come 
I feel like a god has whispered the secrets of life into my ear. This album is not just a wonderful piece of art, it's one of the most important things I have experienced in my whole life. There are no words for the way this music reveals, accepts and celebrates the quiet truths of the human condition; there is only birdsong. I cannot listen to it without simultaneously crying and smiling my face off 
There are no really good songs on this cd. i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush. This is an ode to her ego. The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'. Nearly every song was great. And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father. Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent. But her new CD is frankly bad. But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars. Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long. It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent 
I received "Aerial" last December, and it still amazes me. The music soars and sweeps, carrying the listener along on its wings. It is a work of genius, and those who are long-time Kate Bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive! This two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences, in my opinion. The first disc, "A Sea of Honey" is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces, first of which is "King of the Mountain," probably the most "commercially appealing" song on the album. "King of the Mountain" sucks the listener in with deep, murky tones and Kate's voice easing into the song softly, building in intensity as the song progresses. "King of the Mountain" is followed by songs like "Pi" (who else but Kate Bush could make the derivation of Pi sound so sexy?) and "Bertie," a lovely Elizabethan paean to her young son. Then there are emotionally raw songs like "Mrs. Bartolozzi" and "A Coral Room," the latter of which is about Kate's late Mother. The reclusive Ms. Bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in "How to Be Invisible," and sings in reference to Joan of Arc in "Joanni." After being captivated by songs about famous people, and more down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs, the listener comes to the second disc, titled "A Sky of Honey." This is, in my opinion, the piï¿½ce de rï¿½sistance of "Aerial." This disc is a continuous journey of sound, taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by--among other things--the sounds of birds, the sound of her child's voice, and Kate Bush's silky voice singing in Italian. The disc is almost indescribably beautiful, in my opinion. I love the way "A Sky of Honey" takes me out of myself when I hear it. I feel like I am flying at points; becoming one with the soaring birds. My personal favorite on "A Sky of Honey" is "Nocturn," a surreal nighttime romp on the beach, accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of Kate Bush's voice. The disc's final (and title) track "Aerial" is a forceful climax to the sonic journey, and ends with Bush singing: "I want to be up on the roof I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on the roof In the sun" It is as though Kate Bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip. What an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is! To Kate Bush fans, I cannot recommend this album highly enough. True, it was a very long wait for this new CD, but, Ms. Bush has rewarded her fans duly; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph! If you are a Kate Bush devotee, you will not be disappointed! And, if you are new to Kate Bush, "Aerial" will be a great introduction to her genius. Kate Bush is like no other artist I can name. Her voice is incredibly versatile; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee, a temptress or a child. And, so far in her career, it Kate Bush's voice gets better with the passing of time. Like a fine wine, one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly. "Aerial" is well, well worth listening to, and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is. 
This is a mature, feminine, ethereal and extremely beautiful piece of art! No one makes music like Kate Bush and Aerial proves it! Both discs are great, but A Sky Of Honey is obviously the true gem as it is a conceptual piece! There's no one like her and there never will! 
As I commute home in the golden afternoon sun, listening to the song cycle "A Sky of Honey" on the 2nd disc is like going off on a vacation and returning quite refreshed, all in the span of 40 minutes. I feel like I've slipped away to a little ocean village in Italy with my one true romantic love, and that God made the world just for her and I. I feel like I skinny-dipped in the ocean under a dome of stars, and the birds sing, and nature and mankind are united in love and laughter forever. Thank you Kate for touching both mind and soul! 
I can't explain how powerfully this album moves me. At first listen, I was disappointed. There was no "Night of the Swallow," no "Moving," or other rousing songs that make me want to dance, alone, in the night. Then, I read someone's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone. I made time for this album. Time alone for me is scarce, but I missed Kate and made room for her. We cooked together, went on long walks, even went running once or twice. I fell in love with "Sunset" first. The flamenco guitars, the rhythm picking up, the multiple sky images. I listen to this and feel one with the sky. It is such a positive, beautiful album. Listening to it feels like a religious experience. This is not party music. It's not for socializing either. I had a good friend over and I just wanted to tell her to stop talking so I could soak in this beautiful, beautiful music. Kate's voice is softer here. She wears her motherhood comfortably, and it shows, yet she still has that incredible vocal range. I had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me. I was wrong. That doesn't mean I like all songs equally. I listen to the songs on the first disk (especially while running), but it's disk 2 that captured my heart. "Sunset," then "Nocturn." Then, sweet "Aerial:" "I want to be up on the roof I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on the roof In the sun." I am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience. You have to live it, immerse yourself in it, give yourself over to it. For those of you disappointed with it, I recommend giving it another chance. Especially listen to it outside. I think you might yourself similarly entranced as I was. 
To give it credit, this CD set is beautifully produced, and reminds me many times of Windham Hill recordings. It is dominated by slow tempo acoustic arrangements, usually piano. Kate's voice is of course gorgeous, and the lyrics are often excellent. However, all of that can be intellectually appreciated, but it's different than enjoying it. If you are looking for any of the adventure, creativity, or risk-taking that characterizes so much of her other work you will be disappointed. Maybe two songs on the entire two-CD set have any true life to them. Only one really has any of the vocal fun that made so much of her earlier work exciting. Also, other than the many straightforward piano arrangements, most of the remaining songs seem to re-use pieces of sounds or rythms from previous work. I own all her other work and I hate to say it but this CD set is disappointing and I don't suspect I'll replay it often if at all. For the most part, your ear and mind quickly forget this CD as soon as you've heard it 
I love the show, and the soundtrack is just as good. Like the show, the music is a little dark, but great 
I'm normally not an indie rock fan, but I've always been a fan of the music on the show. This soundtrack is awesome--it's eclectic and powerful and I honestly couldn't stop listening to it for over a week in the car 
Really nothing on this is bad. The best IMHO is Rubyhorse, the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Subways but a case could be made for any of the songs. The only problem is now I have 8 other CDs I need to buy 
Loved it, such a variety. I however do agree with the others when said there were others that should have been included on this disc. But maybe that should come with the second disc 
Love the music on this CD--takes you back to certain scenes in the program. It is the best show on TV 
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This show just keeps getting better and better 
Loved the "bits" of songs I heard from the show and was a little hesitant about ordering the soundtrack as most only have a few songs that are good or okay in the whole. This soundtrack, however, is an incredible surprise. Every song is interesting, fresh, and great to listen to. Whomever took the time to pick these songs deserves a huge thumbs-up. Thank you 
I bought this for my husband for Father's Day as well as the Von Bondies CD and he absolutely LOVES both CD's!!! It was nice to read the insert and have it written by Denis Leary himself. He gave credit to his son for choosing the Von Bondies song...looks like his son is on the road to a successful career in music just like his dad is in television 
All these songs have one thing in common, they all make this the most exciting one to watch 
Dennis Leary picked some great tunes, far from the ordinary [...] you hear on the radio day-to-day. If you're bored with the usual, and are open to something better, this is a great CD. It helps if you're a "Rescue Me" fan as well; you can keep in mind what tune goes with which scene from the show 
... ... ... Mr. Lamontagne CD's will inspire you to see him live. Seeing Mr. Lamontagne and his wonderful band will leave you feeling catered to. When it's time to go home, just because it would be unfair to encourage yet another encore for someone who has already poured out his soul and deserves a rest, you'll appreciate that you at least still have Mr. Lamontagne's CD's to go home to. Many thanks to "RayRay All The Way" and his band; well done; hope you'll make our gorgeous Spreckles a bit of a habit. 
I LOVE Ray Montagne - and I loved Trouble (his first album). This second album speaks the truth about finding your answers inside of you! And the songs, from beginning to end, speak of all that occupies the world today. Truly a remarkable and gifted song-writer who sings from his soul 
Ray Lamontagne's new album contains more instrumentation than his first. Although I wasn't sure at first whether I liked it as much as Trouble which I loved from the very first time I heard it, this one gets better the more you listen to it. Track 11 is one of his best ever and one of the nicest songs I've ever heard 
I liked Trouble but I think this CD is a little better. I like the musical arrangements better this time around. The addition of John Medeski and Chris Wood give the music a deeper more full sound. Trouble sounded mostly like Ray playing an acoustic guitar. Where Till the Sun Turns Black really has some excelent backing musicians. Lyrically I like both about the same. I say to get both discs they have alot to offer. 
its more like Dan Fogelberg. While I was really blown away by the CD's first two tracks, I found the rest of the album a bit of a let-down: Pleasant, a nice showcase for Mr. LaMontayne voice, but lyrically undistinguished. Even so, I've enjoyed the CD quite a bit -- ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TWO TRACKS -- and would recommend it to fans of Nick Drake, Jack Johnson and -- face it -- Dan Fogelberg. I know it's hipper to be likened to Drake than Fogelberg (by a long stretch) but let's not get carried away, people 
After Trouble and his Austin City Limits appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer songwriter. This follow up has made me reconsider, because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist. He waited and it was worth the wait. This reminded me immediately of John Lennon (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way. I didn't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording. Enjoy 
...is the first thing I said when I put on "Till The Sun Turns Black" for the first time. Ray Lamontagne has seemed to put away his Van Morrisson records which inspired him for his debut album "Trouble" and picked up a copy of "Pink Moon" by the aforementioned Drake. This new record seems to be an opposite reaction to "Trouble" and I think it works. Yet, my problem with both of his LP's is that they aren't great records straight through. I rarely listen to the last half of "Trouble", except for the wonderfully serene "All The Wild Horses", because all of the stand out tracks appear in the first 5 slots (a problem with the sequencing on many modern albums). While "Till The Sun Turns Black" is a better sequenced album I still think it could have been stronger. Yes the songs are dark, brooding, and delicate but we've heard much of this before from other artists. I wish Lamontagne had branched out a bit more with this album. I am all for beautifully restrained music but this is almost too low key without pushing the envelope enough. It's not anywhere near the inspiration of a Nick Drake album because not only did Drake sound like this over thirty years ago, but he did it with more artistry and dynamics. Lamontagne should have taken notes on progression from albums like "Sea Change" by Beck or drenched this one in more emotion as Damien Rice did on his masterful "O". What I really wish is that Lamontagne had combined "Trouble" with this one. Mix the best five tracks from each LP and make one album, that would have been an incredible venture. I think Ray is still finding himself as a songwriter. Hopefully we have not seen his definitive work as of yet. Once he's done with all of the impersonations we'll see how he does. "Till The Sun Turns Black" is a nice, well produced album, but it's nothing Lamontagnes heroes haven't done in the distant past. 
This is a very good record. But it should have been even better. Here is the problem. It is a moment from Shelter, Ray's best-known song from "Trouble". In the second chorus, as Ray plaintively sings that he Will Shelter You, the strings come in and the song heads into the stratosphere. A great song, beautifully orchestrated. In "Till The Sun Turns Black" Ray and his producer seem to be looking for that moment again and again but instead the orchestration pulls down some otherwise great songs. Two of the best examples are the opening Be Here Now and the albums title track Till the Sun Turns Black. Be Here Now is an epic song that has been on repeat from the moment I first heard it. That the cd starts with this meditative six plus minute song is a hint that this cd was not just made to churn out sales. Yet as great as the song is, as great as Ray's controlled, whisper-like vocal is, as tasteful as much of the production is, this song has a moment too. In the second verse, after you are already totally sold, the strings become overblown and somewhat sappy. Something that is totally unnecessary when there is a singular voice like Ray's to carry the song. It is still the best song on the album, but that moment is a little bit of a let down. On the title track the strings are so far out of control it turns a very good song into a ho-hum affair. There is a live version of this song that I've been listening to for almost a year- just Ray, accompanying his own vocal with guitar. There is NO comparison between the two versions. The lyrics may be a little trite, but the power of Ray's voice on the live version, especially at the chorus, is front and center- a force to be reckoned with. That said, there are many excellent songs on the record, and many of them are orchestrated very well. For the first four songs alone the cd is worth the price and is more to my taste than most of Trouble. Perhaps the problem is insecurity. Ray just needs to believe in the power of his own songs and his voice and he will be fine. There is nothing wrong with adding instrumentation; he just needs to find the right balance. Neil Young used brass and strings to great effect on some of his landmark songs from the '70's. Ray has said one of his main influences is Stephen Stills. A song like 4+20 from Deja Vu is perfect in it's spare and quiet brilliance. Maybe he needs to look to Neil more when the urge strikes to add those cinematic flourishes. Not that Neil is immune, as anyone who's ever heard A Man Needs A Maid will attest.  
I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive 
Once his second Lp, "Word of Mouf" dropped and sailed to the top of the charts, Ludacris became one of the most popular and talked about rappers of the new millenium. In 2002 he brought his group into the game with their album, "Golden Grain" which went on to sell over 500,000 copies. But now in 2003 it's time for Luda to step back in the lime light riding solo again with the release of his 3rd album, "Chick-N-Beer." 1. Southern Fried (Intro) - 4/5 2. Blow It Out - 4.5/5 3. Stand Up (Featuring Shawnna) - 4/5 4. Rob Quarters (Skit) - No Rating 5. Splash Waterfalls - 3/5 6. Hard Times (Featuring Eightball, MJG Carl Thomas) - 4.5/5 7. Diamond in the Back - 3/5 8.

Eyebrows Down (Featuring T*** Boi Dolla Boy) - 5/5 Overall: 54/65 4 Stars Ludacris really surprised me with this album. On some of these tracks he took a different approach in structuring them like "Splash Waterfalls", "Screwed Up" and "Diamond in the Back" and for the most part it was a bad decision. But Luda definitely brings the heat like expected when it comes to production and lyrics.

Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days. Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
From that high-profile snafu with Pepsi and Bill O'Riley to his movie roles, Ludacris keeps busy. It's easy to think that he's not focusing on the rap game if he's into so much other stuff right? Wrong. Chicken -N- Beer, the Atlanta-bred rapper's third release on Def Jam is a 4-star effort, and by far his best album to date. Ludacris, relies heavily on his own talent and that of his crew, Disturbing Tha Peace (DTP). Of the 13 tracks, only four feature established artists. High-profile vocals include Snoop Dogg on "Hoes in My Room," Chingy on "We Got," 8 Ball MJG and Carl Thomas on "Hard Times" and Houston's Lil Flip on "Screwed Up." The production team for Chicken -N- Beer is an assorted order. Erick Sermon, Kanye West, DJ Paul and Juicy "J" share the roster with lesser-known beat masters Icedrake, Ruh Anubis, and Jook. Beats provided by this team are more than enough to hook the listener, but craftily they don't overshadow Ludacris's flow. The recipe for the album is similar to the rapper's prior two: freestyle sessions, smoking and drinking, partying, sex, introspection and pimpin'. The ingredients are similar to other mainstream rap albums but Ludacris's charismatic delivery and hilarious rhymes continue to make him stand out. The lead single, "Stand Up" is the Kanye West-produced (and Ludacris co-produced) club banger. It has the right amount of energy and punch lines that makes it enjoyable in the club as well as in the car. Another standout track is "Splash Waterfalls." The verses follow along the progression of a romantic relationship--one that's full of kinky sex. But the verses aren't what make this song great. Icedrake put together a track that's mellow in the background but is laced with a fierce drum loop full of bounce. "Screwed Up" is Ludacris's ode to the Houston style of "screwed" music. The beat sounds a bit like a slowed down circus ditty laced with a lot of bounce from the beat machine. Lil Flip lends his drawled vocals for a few verses as they flip about staying high off of weed and lean. "Hip Hop Quotables" is version three of the freestyle track that always appeared on Ludacris albums with Erick Sermon's minimalist head-bobbing production allowing listeners to pay attention to the lyrics. The punch lines come back to back to back on this track. Don't laugh too much or you'll miss the next joke. Ludacris continues to improve as a lyricist despite keeping busy in the movies and his philanthropic efforts. Chicken -N- Beer is served up well and fans will want a large order. 
Decent album here by Ludacris. I actually give this album about a 3.75 rating. I liked Ludacris older tracks/albums better. But this one is decent, for southern music that is. I think the production on this album is pretty good, gots some good beats here n there, some tracks are garbage, most are pretty good. Lyric wise, he does good on some tracks, some his lyrics are garbage. Gotta watch out. If your a fan of Ludacris, I dont find a reason why you wouldnt like this album. Half of it is good, half of it aint that good. Check it out before you cop it. But its good for southern tastes. My Top 5 Songs 1.Hard Times 2.Screwed Up 3.Hip Hop Quotables 4.Teamwork 5.We Go 
Now as with every Ludacris release i anticipate it highly. This tiem he failed to impress me enough. Not to say this album is bad but it kinda fell of compared to his last 2 releases. The album kicks of well with a good intro that is more of a song (actually one of the best IMO). Only 2 songs are bad with about 5 or 6 quality songs and the rest jus good or ok. Of course he drops a nice freestyle again on Hip Hop Quotables. Definitely worth getting if your already a fan but pick up his first album (Back For The First Time)if ur new to Luda. 3.5/5 Top 5: Eyebrows Down Sothern Fried Intro Teamwork Splash Waterfalls Blow It Ou 
I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong. But this album is kinda annoying. The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive. The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree. He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down. The rest of them are kinda annoying. But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
I really liked this as a full album. The songs all fit really well together, but they all had very different musical influences to them from old timey to funky. I love a good beat and all the songs had that. The lyrics were also inventive and fun. It is really the type of record that you can get into and listen to over and over again. I highly recommend it for rock lovers and people who like to listen to music that makes them bop around in the house, car, or on the street with their ipod. Give it a try and have a little fun 
The White Stripes is my favorite post-1996 new music discovery (yes, I am old school). They don't sound like anything else out there, and that's pretty refreshing in comparison to the Nouveau Punk and Retro-New Wave music on the radio today. Their new album, Get Behind Me Satan, is certainly different from their last release, Elephant. This is more a drums and piano set rather than a typical rock album. And make no mistakes, there is nothing typical about it. Most of the songs, such as the campfire sing-a-long "Little Ghost" and "My Doorbell" are simple, catchy tunes that you just can't get out of your head. Then there's the blues number, titled (appropriately enough) "Instinct Blues". One of the things I love about this band is how they use a variety of genres, mixing and matching elements from each. Jack White always seem to be able to make something new and innovative but somehow still sound familiar. There are some loud guitars and crashing drums for those into heavier listening. Besides the radio friendly hits "Blue Orchid" and "The Denial Twist" there is also "The Nurse" and "Red Rain". These last two songs are a little more eclectically put together, however. My absolute favorite song is the last one on the album, "I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet)". It's very minimalist, featuring just Jack playing a piano and singing slightly off-key. It's beautiful and silly all at once. (It would make a great country music cover if anyone had the balls to do it.) Overall, this is a great album. The slower songs are mixed in well with the punchier ones. It definitely is an interesting listening experience. Pick it up and give it a try if you can. 
blue orchid is a great song but the rest of the album sux...the songs are kinda weird 
I always get worried with every new album a band I like comes out with. Will it suck? Did they sell out? Will it make me regret ever liking the band to begin with? No worries with the White Stripes, though. They're consistent when it comes to making great White Stripes music. And Get Behind Me Satan is no disappointment. I recommend it highly to any White Stripes fan. I've listened to it so many times, well, there's no way to count. But I do plan to listen to it lots more. 
It would have been good if the item was delivered. Too difficult to follow Amazon up, no further purchases to be made 
I know the critics have dissed it but I love it. Best songs. Red Rain Forever For Her Instinct Blues The Nurse If you like the Stripes you'll like this one 
this will be the peak of the white stripes catalog. although their past albums have been brilliant finally the noisy reverberation known formerly as the white stripes has been put to sleep on this number and instead has been replaced with beautifully constructed 3 minute masterpieces. instead of reinventing the blues with every song, each song is completely different from the last but yet just as brilliant as the next. Check out forever for her (is over for me), take, take, take and the denial twist if you want to hear the best stuff mr. and mrs. white has written to date 
Jack White has done it again! This is my second White Stripes CD (first being Elephant) and it does not disappoint. Jack White still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals. This album seems more mature in a way but at the same time, you know it's the White Stripes from the opening riff and when Jack's vocals come in. Red Rain, White Moon, and Blue Orchid shows that Jack White loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles. My favorites, though, are Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet). I think I still like Elephant better but one thing is for certain - the White Stripes aren't fading away anytime soon. I love his Led Zeppelin/Nirvana style voice and can't wait to hear his new band, The Raconteurs 
I usually don't pay attention to the reviews, but I was so surprised to see people diss Yung Joc. I'm not exactly a "rap" type of person and I thought this album was hot. Yung Joc has very promising tracks on this album. My favorites are:  1.Intro 2.It's Going Down 4.Do Ya Bad 7.Dopeboy Magic 8.Patrone 11.Chopper Drummin' 12.I Know You See It 15.Knock It Out Fire verses like on "Dopeboy Magic" show other rappers should watch out for Yung Joc in the future. I thought this album was well worth my money. There are certain weak songs on the album and another weak point is the interludes. They are a little too long and boring. Although some give it 1 star, I have to give it 4 and a half because Yung Joc gave my favorite rapper, Kanye West, a run for his money 
I can't understand why so many people are hating on Yung Joc because he released one of the tightest rap CD's of 2006. While Yung Joc's lyrics aren't exactly mind blowing,there's a lot here to satisfy the listener. What he lacks in the lyrical department he makes up for with some really nice flows over hypnotic,neck-jerking beats and loose,sliding basslines. He injects a lot of personality,Southern charm,and warmth into his rhymes and vocals. Like a lot of other rappers from the ATL,he has that distinct Dirty South drawl. At times,he brings to mind 50 Cent's sing-song rhyme delivery,e.g."It's Goin' Down", but mostly he channels the essence of the Urban Legend,T.I. He sounds especially reminiscent of the King of the South on tracks such as "Do Ya Bad" and "Dope Boy Magic". But he contributes enough of his own originality,high energy engaging style to make him more than just another emulator of a popular rapper's rhyme style. He comes off as more of an innovator than a cheap rip-off or imitator. So it's official. Yung Joc's debut album is going down as one of the hottest joints of the Summer of 2006. He drops an album with some tight flows wrapped around sizzling,straight-fire beats,and he comes up with a disc that is highly enjoyable and definitely lives up to the hype. I would suggest buying this one because it is well worth your money. The Best Tracks on this disc are: 1) It's Goin' Down 2) Do Ya Bad 3) Dope Boy Magic 4) Patron 5) I Know You See It 6) Hear Me Comin' 7) 1st Time 8) Knock It Out 9) Picture Perfect 
kay, i'll review each song and give it a rating. 1. New Joc City- Sets the mood of the CD. 2/5 2. It's Goin Down- A masterpiece. People across America are catching on to the motorcycle dance. 5/5 3. He Stayed In Trouble- A very boring interlude. 1/5 4. Do Ya Bad- A catchy tune that gets stuck in your head. 3/5 5. Don't Play Wit It- It took me a while to get sick of it. 3/5 6. Excuse Me Officer- Another interlude but better than the last. 2/5 7. Dope Boy Magic- Original and awesome. 4/5 8. Patrone- Still a favorite. It took a couple lines from "It's Goin Down" and put it as the chorus in a new song. 5/5 9. Flip Flop- I like the chorus. 3/5 10. I'm Him- A good hip hop beat. A new style for Joc. 2/5 11. Hear Me Coming- A favorite from the start. Could be a great single. 4/5 12. I Know You See It- Got me from the beginning. The video isn't bad either. 5/5 13. Yung N*gga- ANOTHER interlude 14. 1st Time- Slow but very smooth. A possible candidate for a single. 4/5 15. Knock It Out- A filler. 1/5 16. Picture Perfect- Not a very good wrap-up. 1/5 Well i hope this helps a bit. peace 
I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is. 
I got one word: RETARDED. It fits this album and also every one of the reviewers here, that gave this bs more than one star. 
I never heard of Young Joc until I placed his CD in my system and its banging. I am from Harlem NY and I was born and raised in Hip Hop so I know good music when I hear it. This CD is hot. Ok so he is not Nas or Jay-Z at the mic, so what? If you are a lyrically oriented dude don't by this CD but don't hate it. Just listen to the beats, ya'll. I drive an AUDI A6 with a system that has close to 3,000 watts in it. This CD brings out the best sounds in my ride. The cd is fun to listen to, the beats are tight, and his flow is average but none the less its a great cd. Who else is out there with beats such as these? TI, Mike Jones, and PIMP C comes close to this one. If you want lyrics go and buy Busta's newest. If you are the type stuck on KRS-1 and what not, you gots to move on. He is a legend no doubt but the South is where is at at the moment. Nuff said. 
This is precisely the kind of mindless drivel that passes for music in today's world. Very sad commentary that anyone would give this guy a contract much less that anyone would BUY his product and promote his talentless self. If he's lucky, he won't end up like Mike Tyson. But that's another story for another day 
If you are a fan of Ashlee Simpson or Kelly Osbourne, I think you'll really like this album. This seems to be the template for their careers. If you are into anything rougher/cruder in sound than those ladies, I'd say stay away from this. It will only disappoint 
Also, pay attention to the fluctuating 4 to 4-and-a-half star rating this album got as of 1999, after 84 reviews. That means, more or less, 84 people gave this album a review that warrants at least an "excellent". Sleater-Kinney will be missed. 
During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done 
I've been a fan from the beginning, and this is my favorite Sleater-Kinney album (though THE WOODS is now vying for the title!). The others always get talked up more than this, arguably their most intimate and painful record. I don't know if it's the production, the lyrics, or the music itself, but this record always feels to me like a secret whispered by your best friend in a dark bedroom late at night and long ago, or a kiss from someone you know you can't hold onto. The technique of Corin and Carrie singing two different lyrics at the same time is in itself a feminist statement -- you cannot pin us down, we are both at once. Although I loved their records before this, THE HOT ROCK is The One that made me fall IN love with them 
Saw them last year in the UK, really thought they were excellent Just got round to getting this and I have to say that it is brilliant...melodic and intense. Was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the live show but it surpassed it.. 
Sleater-Kinney has been my favorite band for some time now, and through my exploration of their works I've never been let down by a single album, or a single song. To me, every Sleater-Kinney album is incredible. These women know how to make amazing music, but with The Hot Rock it had something more boiling under its skin. Something about this album resonates with me on every level. Each song just creates this powerful emotional current, a current that will sweep you away to musical bliss. It's hard to determine which Sleater-Kinney albums are better than the others - in my mind they are all untouchable pieces of music, standing all on their own, seprarate from everything else. I have determined though, that The Hot Rock is my favorite of these works, each song as great as the last, filling you with what you've been missing but never knew you lost. This is Sleater-Kinney at their absolute best. This album has changed and saved my life countless times. Listen to this and breathe deeply: This is music as music should be 
this band has a cute singer, Corina with chipmunk cheeks. She sounds like Belinda Carlile. I just want to pinch her cheeks! 
By the release of "The Hot Rock" in '99, it was clear that Sleater-Kinney had arrived at an unprescedentedly intricate sonic asthetic; contrapuntal and angular, yet ferociously contained, thier attack lies in the constant tension between the band's two stellar leads--listening to Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker sing thier often conflicting lines simultaneously is to be privy to a fascinating, constantly evolving relationship, one where the urge to support and celebrate one another is continually challenged by a dynamic in which each little bit of emotional real estate that's offered as a gesture of compromise is burdened with world-historic import. Of coarse, all this staggeringly cerebral conceptual metaphor slinging would be dull as door knobs if it weren't for the band's talent as musicians and songwriters; that S-K can cram enough of this stuff to fullfill several senior thesis requirements into music so gloriously engaging, kinetic, and just plain rockin' is a testament to just how important this band is. Few have operated so proficiently on simultaneous levels of chops, content and execution. As a guitarist, Carrie Brownstein has more chops than Paul Bunyon, creating the most arresting, original guitar sound since Peter Buck or The Edge (or Pete Townshend, or Tom Verlain--pick one, the point is, the woman's GOOD) Rarely playing anything that resembles a traditional riff, her arsenal of quicksilver leads and choppy, percussive arpeggios give S-K's music and incredibly elastic, unpredictable quality the makes their records among the most listenable in rock. Corin Tucker, on the other hand, is mostly voice, but what a voice it is--a riveting, ennervating force of nature that gives visceral physicality and unforgettable conviction to her lyrics. She may have the best set of pipes in rock. Then there's Janet Weiss--not doubt one the best drummers in rock, slamming all this stunning musicianship into orbit with unshakable consistancy. You can hear all this loud and clear on "The Hot Rock", and if this album lacks the breathless rush of thier previous effort, "Dig Me Out", well, that's only disappointing if you expected them to reinvigorate rock twice in a row. On this record, the band intorduces several directions they could go in, and they're all thrilling to contemplate---"Start Together" is a surging anthem, so full to bursting with righteous conviction and sure-footed authority they could sustain an entire album of these(others in this vien include the blistering "God Is A Number", where Corin nearly turns her voice inside-out, and "The End Of You" an impossibly ingenious song that equates navigating the music biz on a tiny, proud indie label with pirates on the open sea.) Contrasting this angle are bracingly subdued songs like the aching "Don't Talk Like", with lines like "there's a part of me/ that works just like a child" aiming strait for the heart strings, and "The Size of Our Love", sung by Carrie, that takes on the tricky subject of love and faithfulness in the face of death with out a hint of cliche or sentitiousness. "Burn, Don't Freeze" is head-spinningly complex, "Banned From The End Of The World" is infectiously bouncy, and "Memorize Your Lines" is stunningly evocative, with a lush bed of cellos and florid, almost gothic atmosphere. "One Song For You" throws a perfect little temper tantrum at the end, with the band revving up behind Corin as she drops the kiss-off line of the century, educated-punk-grrl division: "drop little boy crumbs you could follow back/ when you get lost becoming a man." Ouch, Corin. Very ouch. The other songs that I haven't specifically drooled over are great, as well. Suffice it to say that this record [isn't bad] 
I listen to Bob and Tom every morning. Yes, they're very funny, but not exactly adult. The humor is almost always adolescent, sometimes childish. And they are usually very, very funny. If ou're into highbrow humor, skip them. But if there's a naughty ittle kid inside you, then you'll love them 
This is the funniest cd i have ever purchased. I just started listening to them on the radio (KSHE 95, 94.7 FM for those not in the St. Louis and surrounding areas) and their skits are the funniest skits you could ever hear. When I found out that they had a greatest hits cd out i immediately rushed out and bought it. When i put it in my cd player, i couldn't take it out 
This is by far the funniest CD I own. They should have a new one coming out soon I hope! They have the cleverest humor. These songs and skits are the type that stay with you. Everytime I see an orange barrel the song just pops in my head. Bob, Tom, Chick Christy rock! The FCC must be going crazy 
BOB TOM'S Greatest Hits is a 2-CD collection full of songs and spoken comedy. You will be going off the wall with these wild and crazy guys. My personal favorites are Dicken's Cider Prisoner of Love Larry King Head Shampoo Orange Barrels and I Wanna Be Like Hef. 
These guys are hilarious! If you ever chuckled at Wierd Al Yankovicks' parody tunes, you will be rolling on the floor with this CD. The Band and the arrangements are first rate, and the lyrics and vocals are waaay off the wall. This is a two CD set, and it is packed full. Personal favorite is Can't Stop Stalking You, a Harry Connick sound-alike with outstanding big-band backing. A Girl Like You, is a scream, with vocals and lyrics worthy of Melissa Etheridge. Duke Tumatoe and the Love Brothers, might give you some hint of what you are about to listen to. And------it is true-this cd is not for the squeamish, or easily embarrassed, but it is one heck of a party collection! Rock On, Bob Tom 
I'm so psyched that BOB TOM decided to release their Greatest Hits album in stores nationwide. This is just as funny as Adam Sandler and Cheech Chong, fans of the show will recognize some classic comedy tracks such as Dear Penthouse, Dicken's Cider, and Prisoner of Love! You don't have to be a fan of the show to get this, although it might help just a little 
I stumbled onto this after picking up Blackberry Belle (also outstanding), and it is a great companion EP to that record. In addition, it features exquisite cover art and is a limited edition. If you're a fan of Afghan Whigs, I'd highly recommend rediscovering Greg Dulli with this EP and Blackberry Belle 
Greg Dulli and the Twilight Singers released some fantastic music with this album. The tunes are wonderful and Greg's voice is at it's best 
Get this now. It's limited to 2500 copies. If you love Afghan Whigs or the other Twilight Singers you will love this. BUY NOW!! Hurry before its sold out 
Love it, love it, love it. McGraw demonstrates depth and range. 
It's great. Buy it. You won't be disappointed!! 
I have always been a big fan of Tim McGraw! His voice is absolutely gorgeous, and he always turns out hit after hit. His first greatest hits is one of the best greatest hits CDs available, and I highly recommend it to everyone! 1. "Indian Outlaw" - Without a doubt, my least favorite on the entire disc. His voice was not quite as strong on this one as it is on his later songs. This was the song that really shot him into the spotlight. It is catchy, but it definitely does not measure up to the standards of the others. 2. "Don't Take The Girl" - I LOVE this song. This is a very beautiful song about a couple who grew and went through many various struggles together. First, the boy didn't like the girl and pleads his father not to take her with them on a trip. Then, as they are dating, they are held up with her as a hostage, and he pleads for him to take everything except her. Finally, he begs God not to let her die, even to let him die, instead of her who is dying from pregnancy complications. This is a gorgeous song that gives chills to the listener. 3. "She Never Lets It Go To Her Heart" - This is another really great song. Tim reflects on a woman who is the object of desire for a lot of different men, but "she never lets it go to her heart", and she always goes back to him. 4. "I Like It, I Love It" - I do like this song, but it is not one of my absolute favorites like others. His voice is definitely country in this song. A guy is told that he's getting in too deep in a relationship, but he doesn't care and just keeps wanting more of her and her love. 5. "Just To See You Smile" - I LOVE this song. It is just such a beautiful song, and his voice really shines. The guy loves this woman so much that he would do absolutely anything for her: "Just to see you smile/I'd do anything that you wanted me to/When all is said and done/I'd never count the cost/It's worth all that's lost/Just to see you smile". 6. "It's Your Love (with Faith Hill)" - Without a doubt, one of the best songs on the disc, and one of Tim's best songs EVER. The vocals from both him and his wife Faith are exceptional, and the song is all-around breathtaking. If you ever need an outstandingly beautiful song for a wedding, pick this one: "Oh, it's a beautiful thing/Don't think I can keep it all in/I just gotta let you know/What it is that won't let me go//It's your love/It just does something to me/It sends a shock right through me/I can't get enough/And if you wonder/About the spell I'm under/Oh, it's your love//Better than I was, more than I am/And all of this happened by taking your hand/And who I am no is who I wanted to be/And now that we're together/I'm stronger than ever/I'm happy and free". You just can't feel sad when listening to this song. Absolutely breathtaking. This song alone is worth the entire disc! 7. "Where The Green Grass Grows" - Another song where he sounds very country, but it's still good. A guy just wants to enjoy the simple life with the woman he lives and "where the green grass grows" with no problems around them. 8. "For A Little While" - A man reflecting on a summer love where they weren't together for very long, but he was glad that he got to be with her "for a little while". His voice is great, and it was during the transition from sounding very country to what it is today. "And I laugh everytime I start to think about us/We sent that summer out in style/And she's gone but she left me with a smile/Cause she was mine for a little while". 9. "Please Remember Me" - Another of the absolute best tracks on the disc. His voice is so gorgeous and haunting on this song. A couple broke apart, and he knows that she'll find someone new, but he still loves her, and he begs her to always remember him. Very beautiful song. "When all our tears have reached the sea/Part of you will live in me/Way down deep inside my heart/The days keep coming without fail/A new wind is gonna find your sail/That's where your journey starts//You'll find better love/Strong as it ever was/Deep as the river runs/Warm as the morning sun/Please remember me". Another song for which it's worth getting the entire disc! 10. "Something Like That" - A guy reflects on an old love, and remembers in detail everything about them because "a heart don't forget something like that". Another song where his voice is really country sounding, but it's still a very fun and catchy song. 11. "My Best Friend" - Another song that I really love. A man confessing to the love of his life that she's more than just a lover - she's his best friend and means the world to him. Yet another song that people should get the disc for, and it is also another of Tim's best and most beautiful love songs. "I never had no one I could count on/I've been let down so many times/I was tired of hurtin/So tired of searchin/Til you walked into my life/It was a feelin' I'd never known/And for the first time/I didn't feel alone//You're more than a love/There could never be another/To make me feel the way you do/Oh, we just get closer/I fall in love all over/Everytime I look at you/I don't know where I'd be/Without you here with me/Life with you makes perfect sense/You're my best friend/You're my best friend". Absolutely breathtaking. Another beautiful love song. 12. "Maybe We Should Sleep On It" - A couple breaking apart, and as they're moving the bed, the man thinks that maybe they should sleep on it one more time and give themselves another chance. "But, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight/And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds/I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right/So, baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight". 13. "Down On The Farm" - By far, on of his most country sounding songs. It's just a fun song about a group of friends having fun "down on the farm" where they're free of their responsibilites and just enjoying themselves. 14. "Let's Make Love (with Faith Hill)" - A very sensual song mostly for lovers to enjoy. Just as the song tells, a song about a couple who just want to hide away from the world and make love to each other. "Baby, I've been drifting away/Dreaming all day/Of holding you/Touching you/The only thing I want to do/Is be with you/As close to you/As I can be//Let's make love/All night long/Until all our strength is gone/Hold on tight/Just let go/I want to feel you in my soul/Until the sun comes up/Let's make love/Oh, baby". The most adult song on the disc, and the vocals are outstanding. 15. "My Next Thirty Years" - This is another more mature and introspective song. The man is reflecting on this life when he turns thirty and he vows to be different in his next thirty, providing inspiration to other people wanting to change for the better. "My next thirty years, I'm gonna have some fun/Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done/Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears/And I'll do it better in my next thirty years//My next thirty years, I'm gonna settle all the scores/Cry a little less, laugh a little more/Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear/Figure out just what I'm doing here/In my next thirty years//Oh, my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight/Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late/Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers/Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years". There is something on this disc for everyone out there. There are simple fun songs, there are breathtakingly beautiful love songs, there are songs about heartbreak, there are more adult songs, and there are songs that are introspective and inspirational. There are also singing styles for everyone. On some, his voice is very country, on others it's more contemporary and strong, on others it's in between the two, and in a couple he is joined by his wife Faith Hill. This is an outstanding greatest hits disc honoring the hits from the first half of his exceptional career. I highly recommend this disc to everyone, whether or not you like country, because there is definitely something for everyone. 
Guys, if you've got feelings for Tim, you're gonna love this one. If you know anything about honest to God country music, this is what you look for. This guy is extremely good and his music fits 
Alanna Nash - what qualifications do you have - Karaoke at its best come on - so untrue get up and do this and see if you could attempt one chorus of anything - you better listen to his voice - you are out in left field...I am a music lover of all genres and he can hit the high notes...maybe not as good as Faith but even the weakest singers couldn't do what he has been doing...he picks great music yes and he knows how to add those special hooks....you should never review any music unless you do your homework.. 
I am an old rock and roller--never liked country music--I could not stand the sad songs and twang. However I saw Faith Hill on Oprah a few months ago promoting her Fireflies cd and was lost forever. I have since bought 21 cd's which are all by country artists. My favorite song on the cd was with a man I had never heard--Tim McGraw. I now own all his music, am a member of their fanclub, and have reservations for their next concert. Lost forever in country---------- 
This compilation contains most of the hits that established Tim's reputation as a contemporary country hit-maker. Beginning as a traditional country singer, his debut album attracted little interest and he gradually changed his style with each of his next four albums sounding less country than the one before. Those four albums are the source of the hits featured here. Tim's main strength lies in his unerring ability to select exactly the right songs to appeal to the public and which also suit his voice. He made his major breakthrough with the controversial novelty song Indian outlaw, but none of his other hits here contain controversial lyrics. What you will find are a couple of duets with his wife (It's your love, Let's make love), some up-tempo songs (most notably I like it I love it) and a lot of ballads, among my favorites being Don't take the girl, Just to see you smile, My best friend and the amusing My next thirty years. While some country fans objected to Tim's move away from traditional country music, album sales and singles chart placings justify Tim's decision. This compilation is a reminder that Tim was one of the most successful country singers of the nineties. He didn't stop there, as his inevitable second volume of hits will eventually confirm 
I love this CD! I listen to it all of the time. I can't get enough of Tim and this is him at his best. It is definitely a must have. 
The film may have been a muddled waste of celluloid, but it was the undeserving recipient of a beautiful score from the brilliant and unsung Cliff Martinez. Blending hushed, shimmering orchestration with icy electronic atmospheres, this is gorgeous and subtle minimalist ambience, very similar to his wonderful score for Solaris. At half an hour, it's on the short side, but worth the money nonetheless for fans of Martinez' unique brand of ambient alchemy. 
This is an impressive effort. This CD has been played fairly constantly in my car for the past 3 weeks. What impresses me is that I consistently find new bits that stand out depending on my mood. There are some great grooves, brilliant fills, and rocking riffs in classic Eric Johnson style in the first movement, 'Prelude'. The opener 'Bloom' and 'Good To Me' are probably the highlights there. Mr. Johnson then turns it down a bit during 'Courante', the second movement. 'Sad Legacy' and 'From My Heart' are both great introspective songs. 'Sad Legacy' builds a sense of urgency and 'From My Heart' has a mellower, R feel and nice jazzy runs. These two are probably my favorites off the album. The last movement, 'Allemande' starts off with a nice old-school style jazzy number, 'Hesistant'. 'Magnetized' gets things rocking again, before a very good atmospheric classical guitar piece, 'Ciel' ends the ride. Eric plays an wide variety of styles on this release and manages to keep it all together as one cohesive piece, with one small exception. Tribute to Jerry Reed, while a nice bit of picking doesn't fit on this CD for me, especially after the sitar on 'Cruise The Nile'. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed Ah Via Musicom or Venus Isle. Or, if you aren't familiar with Eric johnson already, then do yourself a favor and pick up a CD. This one is as good as any of his studio albums to start off with. 
Seriously friends...I was watching a youthful EJ on the ACL DVD and he just blew my mind, lick after lick but let's be real...Bloom is a repeat of the same old thing except not as good as it used to be. EJ, take it from one of your biggest fans who owns all of your music...if you come out with another album, don't use samples because you think that they will help you modernize the music or "relate" to the kids. Go into the woodshed and seriously, build a chair. You need to practice and learn something new if you're going to do something original ever again. Otherwise, each and every album that you put out is going to sound the same as old ones...like this one does. Still, much respect. You are a great master of the instrument but, PRACTICE 
This was the first cd of its type I have brought into my audio library,but it was a good introduction. I've known about Eric Johnson for most of his career and always was fond of his sound, but just never got around to adding any of his stuff to my collection. Then I went to a joint Joe Satriani/Eric Johnson evening, and the next day there were 3 new cds in my collection. This, his latest, is a nice presentation of all of his stuff, from chicken-pickin' (the excellent "Tribute to Jerry Reed") to smooth, cool jazz ("Hesitant" ; "Ciel"), to working his pleasant tenor in one of his forays into lyricism (the also pleasant "Sad Legacy" and "Your Sweet Eyes"). My main fault with Johnson's music is I can hardly ever understand what he's singing, but his voice is so agreeable and his tunes so listenable that i'm willing to overlook it. This is a solid body of work, full of clean lilting notes and stinging riffs. A good inclusion in the library of any guitar aficianado 
Bloom is definitely one of Eric Johnson's strongest efforts. Almost every song on the album is a winner. The couple that aren't are still really enjoyable. What I love about EJ is that first he is always very diverse with his songs. They have a wide range of feel and texture that very few musicians have. Secondly his guitar playing is amazing. His guitar's tone is perfect for each song. Be it the signature EJ sound in Columbia, the definite twang in Tribute to Jerry Reed, the Eastern feel in Cruise the Nile or the stirring chimes in Your Sweet Eyes. And he is able to make the guitar pieces important, yet never overbearing. This is definitely an album that gets maximum play on my iPod.. 
EJ remains, in my opinion, one of the two guitarists by whom others should be measured (Steve Morse being the other). This is owing to his sheer technical ability (which many guitarists like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and others possess) coupled with a feel, tone and general musicality which most of the other virtuosos lack. As always, his playing on this CD is incredible. The CD is recorded well and sounds great. If there is one knock, however, it is that EJ is a master of so many styles of guitar playing, that at times the CD feels disjointed (probably why he breaks it down into three segments). He begins with a very EJ-like boogie, then rolls into the more Satriani-esque, followed shortly by what I think is a great, uptempo cover of Dylan's My Back Pages. But later, EJ hits us with some Grand Ole Opry-like country, neoclassical, and even Pat Metheny-like jazz. Don't get me wrong, EJ gets it right and then some every step of the way, it is just that when listed to from start to finish, as a whole, the CD does not flow as well as say Venus Isle 
I know it's a cliche to say that a CD or any other work is greater than the sum of its parts-- but that doesn't prevent it from being true on occasions like these. That's not to denigrate the parts, by the way-- each is wonderful in its own way. I think the amazon.com critic has a point in that a couple of songs here may not live up to their full potential (and I was almost tempted to give this CD 4.5 stars as a result), but my visceral and emotional response to this reality is that these few songs act as a kind of respite, a breathing space, that actually serves the whole. And even each of these songs begins to convince with its own appeal after a few listenings. A collection of musical pieces like this is rare in a pop music context-- or actually any setting. Apart from the Beatles, I can think of few musicians who have been able to create a single work this stylistically diverse, musically nourishing, and yet utterly cohesive in its own captivating way. That Eric Johnson's renown rests upon his world-class guitar virtuosity (which he infuses into this mix occasionally, but never overbearingly), makes this accomplishment even more amazing. I think we have something of a complete musician on our hands here-- a true rarity 
Since it's spring, I thought I'd offer a review of Bloom. I've enjoyed this ablum for the past year, through all seasons, and especially love it while I jog. Actually it makes me more of a runner than a jogger. Ha ha! Bloom's a wonderful album. It's a rich in sound as the earth is in its offerings: dynamic colors in shadows and in the light, beautiful merging and counter-dependent, lush, wriggling, dying, growing, all goodness and radioactive together. There's constant movement from song to song. The beginning is quite emphatic: it pushes the pulse into the upper ranges and completely attacks at times. The dissonant chords near the end of Summer Jam are a real treat. Eric Johnson knows what he's doing. Good to Me is one of my favorites. It's deceivingly simple. The pulse pretty much keeps steady until Sea Secret. Here he dives in and goes a wee bit deeper, apropos to the name. One may suspect he's even become a little political with Sad Legacy. From My Heart is very pretty material. It's perfect for driving at night, windows down, freeway free of clouds of fumes and too many cars. That kind of groove (for me, anyway). From there to the Nile with not too cheesy world tones. By the time the album finishes, it's entirely different. Gone are the fuzz boxes and out has come the classical guitar. Not before Magnetized, though. Sweet runs and great tones abound. It's not hard to enjoy, and especially with the vast number of music choices consumers have at their fingers anymore, Bloom shines 
These songs are quite melodic. This time, I liked his vocal songs better than instrumentals. Its kind of strange. Another great album from a great musician 
Dem Franchize Boyz drifted around the ATL music scene and dropped a number of independent releases, but then their song "White Tee", while not necessarily becoming a major hit by Billboard standards, did give them some brief attention. But that's nothing compared to the popularity they've received thanks to their latest album, On Top of Our Game. I personally don't see what the big deal is about this album. Before I listened to it, I thought I would be annoyed by all the snap music, but it turns out that the problem isn't necessarily the music itself, but the below-average lyrics that all four members of Dem Franchize Boyz put on wax. I never was that impressed by "I Think They Like Me" (an obvious single because it's censored), but the thing is, that's actually the best song on the album. Many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter, like cars ("Ridin' Rims"), bling-blingin' ("You Know What It Is"), and hardcore sex ("Freaky As She Wanna Be" -- and why does Trey Songz keep wasting his talent like this?). The choruses can get a little uncreative too: "Don't Play With Me" has "B, don't play with me" while "Stop Callin' Me" has "B, stop callin' me" (by the way, calling the latter song wack would be an understatement). And "They Don't Like That" makes me wonder if they were reading our minds. The production also tends to get repetitive; when I heard "Suckas Come and Try Me", I felt like singing: "I think I think they like me!" And the remix of "White Tee" is unnecessary, especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here. I'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz are the same group. The only thing more annoying than the group's rapping is when Damon Dash shows up on "Bricks 4 the High". No, he isn't rapping; he's instead talking -- no, not talking; WHINING about severed ties with Jay-Z and Roc-a-Fella (*sigh*...is he still talking about that?). In the end, while I wouldn't call this the worst So So Def album ever (Young, Fly Flashy Vol. 1 gets that honor), it's pretty darn close. If this is Dem Franchize Boyz at the top of their game, what does rock bottom look like? Anthony Ruper 
DFB are a complete disgrace. Remember the days when true artists like Pac, Big, Ice Cube, Nas, Bone Thugs n Harmony etc. gave us classics that had a message of some sort? Well unfortunately, that was back in the 90s where there were few corny acts there and there, but a majority of true people had great music. Fast forward a good decade later. Acts like D4L and DFB has to be the worst thing to hip hop since Vanilla Ice. Don't even call this hip hop or even music. it's a bunch of silly noise that was meant to be played on MTV BET with no substance whatsoever. Even white kids at my school listen to this mess. What has humanity come to? I'm pretty sure if I said who A TRibe Called Quest are, they would have blank faces on them. Yup...so sadly, great hip hop is destroyed by nonsense, lazyness, and dumb lyrics. If you spent a dime on this thing, I truly feel sorry for you b/c I'm pretty sure your farts has more music ability than this. So please stop promoting this garbage. It's a waste of time and spce 
This has got to be the worst pile of trash I ever heard, right now I cant think of anything worse then this. The same ol trash bling and girls. And if you got JD and Bow wow on your album at the same time, its gonna be wack. And do these n***** even know what franchise mean? What does that word have to do with their name? I'll just start a click called ham cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter 
It seems like a majority of reviewers are correct about this album. Just plain wack and trashy snap music to try to sell records. Now some people think that I'm from the south, so I'm supposed to like this type of music. Wrong!! The same people who gave us that single "White Tees" managed to sign to So So Def (Jermaine Dupri what did you do, sell your soul?), and recorded a sophomore album. I guess anybody likes this kind of music, such as the reviewer below me who ironically is a top 1000 reviewer and resides in the same city as me, who claims they're on top of their game, and gave this 4 stars. Now the album is just plain wack for the most parts. Horrible lyrics like "Watch your face beat up my hand" from the somewhat hit song "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" and the un creative repetative chorus on "B**** Stop Callin Me". Mostly the subject matter on this album is about drugs, cars, and going to clubs. Whoop-dee-do. I can just go on and on about how horrible this album is. The guest appearances are horrible also. "Oh I Think The Like Me (remix)" is just as wack as the origonal. This time they bring in the So So Def Allstars (Da Brat, Bow Wow, and Jermaine Dupri) to help add to horrible song. The only good guest appearance is the Three 6 Mafia assisted "Don't Play With Me", and that is one of the better songs on this album. Overall this album fails big time. Dem Franchize Boys did show an improvement- techinically. Their self titled debut was just plain stupid. This here is a level higher, classifing it as wack. On Top Of Our Game is basically classified as 'been there, done that' only in a less creative way. If this is the "top of their game" their game must not be very big. They did go platnum...in cell phone ringtones, so there is money being made somewhere. Ususally I don't buy albums, if I've already downloaded already, or know that it is going to be wack. I never would have listened to this if my cousin didn't leave this at my house. Hardcore Southern listeners will not like this review, those are the people I can highly recommend this to. Lyrics: F+ Production: F Guest Appearances: D+ (gives a half star because of Three 6 Mafia) Musical Vibes: F- Overall: F Favorite Tracks: Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It, Don't Play With M 
Is this the same Dem Franchize Boyz that came out with a self titled debut album that was oh so horrible two or three years ago rockin White Tees? This can't be the same group that used to drop lyrics like "all of my bills got a zero at the end ( wut dat is?) hunneds and fifties and twenty twen twens!/ if it's less than a dub(20) I don't carry them, you put change in ya piggy bank I put ones fives and tens!/yea my pockets is bulgin, it ain't nothin but my cash..." ??????? This album was a complete surprise. If you check my review of their first album, I completely bashed this group, their debut and their existence, called em one hit wonders (White Tee) and such. But this right here is a different Dem Franchize Boyz. The turnaround is quite simply amazing. The transformation from their debut to this excellent album is like noon and midnite. Don't get it wrong their debut album was quite horrible but this album is bangin bangin bangin. I don't know what these boys got on, some weed or liquor or maybe they just matured but it's just baffling. Enough about that. Dem Franchize Boyz hooked up with Jermaine Dupri on So So Def and Jermaine Dupri has worked his magic because he has these boyz on point and on track. Every song is fire...and the beats are simply bangin. Dem Franchize Boyz, for what they do, deliver lyrically but they do occasionally drop dud verses. The best being Parlae (wit da dreads) even though he just recently got caught for a lick. They get some stars like Bun B, Jim Jones, and Three Six Mafia to come along for the ride. The first single Oh I Think They Like Me made DFB not one hit wonders but made them household names. The second single Lean Wit It Rock Wit It created a serious movement called Snap, even though it existed before that song, it pushed it to the mainstream forefront. It is a great song though that practically anyone can dance to. If that don't make you move check your pulse. The third single Ridin Rims was made for the summer and is exactly that ridin. The next single will be Freaky As She Wanna Be ft. Trey Songz and it will be a big hit especially for the summer. It's my favorite song on the album (I'm a laid back guy so what). Stop Callin Me screams ringtone...and with RIAA now recording platinum ringtone sales...don't be surprised. Basically the whole album is bumpin from the Oomp Camp crunkness Suckas Come And Try Me to the trap songs like My Muzic ft. Bun B and Bricks For The High ft. Jim Jones. There isn't a song that is wack in my opinion and this is coming from a guy who bashed these guys and wrote them off as complete wackness. Trust...this album is tight. DFB are at the of their game and you should check it out 
Since I cannot find a listing for the single "Lean wit it, Rock wit it" on Amazon with enough attention to get my opinion out, I'm going to take the entire album of Dem Franchize Boyz to task. This album is garbage; complete and total garbage. This group is complete and total garbage. Jermaine Dupri and Diddy are garbage for thinking that this style of music can accomplish anything more than just sticking an annoying tune in someone's head that they can't get rid of. There is no real flow to the music and beats are incredibly simple and childish. The little toy piano I had when I was 3 years old can produce more complex music than these guys can. The music also fails to produce anything that would be of any use to dance to in the clubs. Sure, people can do that stupid `Lean wit it, Rock wit it' dance from the video, but that's it. Plus, at this point, doing that dance would get someone seriously laughed at. Groups like Dem Franchize Boyz and D4L have no clue what makes music work and have zero understanding of the kind of beats that make hip hop flow. DFB is an embarrassment to the Atlanta hip hop scene and they need to stop before they and groups like them bring further disrepute to a legendary music city. 
atl has been falling a lot this year. not only are the fools d4l stealing cash but so is this lame rap group dem franchize boyz. they think theyre so cool cuz their name is DEM franchiZe boyZ instead of them franchise boys but really no one but dumb and helpless teenagers that happen to enjoy this cd. their music is lame, sorry ifi offended you, but thats a fact, their beats are wack, lyrics are lame, one positive is that they dont rap about fu*king candy bars...whats next, d4l is gonna call thier music wrapping? anyways, about dfb, just about everything about thier music is lame. the only good song is the i think they like me one because of da brat. otherwise theres probably better rap acts in nebraska then these fools. go get some t.i., luda, shawnna, or da brat 
Easily on of the most creative CDs ever recorded in this genre. I'm mad at myself for waiting so long to buy it 
This is by far MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF THE MILLENNIUM !!! On this albume, Me'shell relinquishes all of her artistic talents captures the true essences of love with songs that are passionate, personal, intimated. Everytime I listen to this album it takes me to a joyful orgasmic atmosphere. A place where love is possible and appreciated. THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT I WILL ONLY LET "THE ONE" LISTEN TO! What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Simply, THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. There's simply no other album that can match up to this masterpiece. 
I have all her cds not to mention almost every soundtrack shes been on. Comfort Woman is my favorite cd. There truly no words to explain the energy that comes off this cd. Just get it if you dont have it 
I just recently bought this album and I can't believe I did not get it upon it's release. It is absolutely pure genius! I love Me'Shell. Lyrically, musically off the charts. She is a truly blessed as her talents cannot be taught. This completes my Me'Shell collection as I now have every recording she has ever made. If you see her name in print just buy whatever it is...you will not be disappointed. This album is simply Awesome! 
How to describe this CD? It's hard. I've said before that Meshell is a genius and a true artist in everyway. I don't think she could ever put out a bad album. Her heart and soul is poured into everything she does. It infuriates me when I ask people if they listen to her and they are clueless of who I'm talking about. How is that possible? But upon further pondering, Meshell's music isn't exactly commerical. Each song is a part of a masterpiece which is the entire album. Take one song out and a listener could be lost. Nah, radio are just a bunch of punks and are cheating their listeners from some great music. End of story. This is a great C 
"Comfort Woman", the fifth studio album of Meshell NdegeoCello is a calming world in itself. The album takes the listener to a completely different place and it is a 40 minutes out-of-worldly experience. Each song progresses beautifully into the next giving it a story-like feel unlike some of her previous work (even though her previous work is just as good). NdegeoCello has looked for new inspirations on this record and it doesn't have as hip-hop a feel as her album "Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape". The vibe to the album is more laid-back and most songs are slow to mid-tempo. 1. "Love Song 1"- A perfect start to the album. It is reminiscent of her song "Call Me" from her first album "Plantation Lullabies". A very nice slow song. Has a reggae vibe. 2. "Come Smoke My Herb"- NdegeoCello's voice is beautiful and spacy in this song. It suits the great instrumentation. 3. "Andomeda The Milky Way"- A very weird spacy song that I love. The beat is perfect and NdegeoCello sounds good. There is honesty in her voice. 4. "Love Song 2"- She continues the spacy feel in this track and it is perfect. Completely abstract lyrics. 5. "Body"- A faster paced track than the rest of the album yet it is great. The lyrics aren't anything too special but the instrumentation is cool. The spacy feeling is kept. 6. "Liliquoi Moon"- One of the most brilliant songs ever. The instruments are just amazing and so are the lyrics. The guitar solo at the end is just amazing and so unexpected. 7. "Love Song 3"- My favourite of the Love songs. The instruments are great and NdegeoCello creates an amazing atmosphere on the track. 8. "Fellowship"- The lyrics for this track really got me thinking. It is a song testing religious boudaries and is brilliant. The instrumentation is inspired by reggae and is brilliantly done. 9. "Good Intentions"- A faster paced track. The instruments are good and the lyrics are cool. Sometimes I feel it is a little out of place. 10. "Thankful"- Seriously brilliant intruments. I am amazed that NdegeoCello has kept the spacy feeling for the whole album without allowing the sound to get old.  Overall I think the album is an amazing piece of work that only Meshell NdegeoCello could produce. Each song has it's own individuality yet each one fits into the album perfectly. At first listen I must admit I didn't recognise the genius of the album and it took me several months to actually appreciate the album for the masterpiece that it is. It is incomparable to any of NdegeoCello's other work and is in no way comparable to other artists out there nowadays. I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone. MARK- 10/1 
Listeners will find themselves transported to a liberating and soothing musical place which seems to transcend space and time. This project brings "neosoul" to new artistic heights as Ndegeocello delivers a masterful neosoul fusion of reggae, rock and funk while setting her passionate lyrics to an ethereal, sonic atmosphere of sensual and seductive grooves. On your first listen, you will find yourself effortlessly transported to Meshell Ndegeocello's musical cosmos which speaks to a mesmerizing universal spirituality and sensuality 
So I'm sitting here on a cold October night, in front of my fireplace, sipping a scotch with Me'Shell playing softly on my stero. I am being enveloped by a warm embrace of soul and sound, swirling around me, almost like a warm, familiar blanket. Is it the scotch? The fire? No, I don't think so, although those things are a perfect compliment to this album. The sounds coming out of my stereo are so smooth and soulful. So delightful. The sounds of this album, the bass, the drums, the little whistles and quirks...but none of them compare to the aching, the soul...of Me'Shell's voice, perfectly moaning softly along to the funky bass lines. I defy you to put this on and not feel that familiar tingle. If only, there was someone here to share this feeling with.. 
I think we all should add this to our 'Music to get busy to' songlist. Fave tracks are Love Songs 1,2,3, and Liliquoi Moon. You may find it hard to just 'chill' with that special someone if you put this one on. Heck, you may not even be able to just 'chill' if you're by yourself...but that's another story. But I will echo the sentiments of some of the other reviewers: THIS ISN'T ANOTHER 'PLANTATION LULLABIES', SO GET OVER IT. Those that are in the know should realize that Meshelle's skills as a musician/songwriter/poet are much deeper than that. She is not the type that's going to be copycating herself. Please, don't be narrow-minded and try to put her in a fishbowl with other one-dimensional artists. Let's all fire up some incense, pour a bottle(or two) and mellow with her 
I am currently a first year college student (but currently a sophomore, if I may boast a bit, as should be expected of a sophomore), am 18 years old, and a theater arts student, currently studying performance art, a medium which has facinated me since my youth. I was introduced to Laurie Anderson at around age 7 or earlier by my father. I fell in love with this album then, though I was unable to really grasp the gravity of it then. The first track, From the Air, truely connected with me, for odd reasons. It was an anthem of what was coming in my life, though I only recently learned that. She captures the fleeting pain of the "American Dream" and what we do to ourselves to protect ourselves from the freedome we are (or were) allowed. She explores everyday human emotion to a ten, trying to help us connect our life to our own tribal nature, also attempting to find what "God" is. Obviously she finds that God within us in the title track, although I recomend everyone to listen to her, despite (if that need be) her Buddhist philosophy. Many will, as another said, "run screaming", but some will find something opens up inside themselves as they experience this journey with Laurie. "You know, I think we should put some mountains here, otherwise, what are the characters going to fall off of? And what about stairs? 
I love this album! I listen to it when I'm kicked back, relaxing and having a smoke. All of the tracks are enjoyable and she utilizes that vocoder so well. I have most of Laurie's albums but this one and "STRANGE ANGELS" are my absolute favorites. These are my favorite "Avante Garde" divas: BJORK, DIAMANDA GALAS, YOKO ONO, NINA HAGEN, LENE LOVITCH and of course LAURIE ANDERSON who's tops on my list. Julius-Alla 
Somewhere in the 70's a new genre was created called performance art. Some of it was shocking, some of it mind numbingly repetative and dull. Laurie Anderson, however, got it right. Complex use of electronics and a somewhat no wave take on music and lyrics creates a fascinating album. Big Science is edgy, clever, fun and intelligent. The only thing missing is the visual aspect of when this material was performed live 
where it all began. Laurie is my favorite musical artist along with Kate Bush and this is her debut recording. Its considered a landmark by most, I saw two whole stacks available for sale in Virgin Megastore the other day, but I don't think its her best album. It has a very cold and removed atmosphere and i'd recommend Mister Heartbreak for any newbies but this is also an important recording. My favorite tracks are From The Air, Born, Never Asked, Let X=X, and It Tango 
1. A dnde voy sin ti 2. Perfume de mujer 3. Bandera blanca 4. Amar y solo amar 5. Sbado por la tarde 6. Das de rosas y amor 7. Hasta amrte 8. Nostalgia 9. Mala yerba 10. Como un jirn de brum 
Commissioned is from the 80's and I was only a baby when they were at their prime, but I am still enjoying to this day. My mother introduced the group to me and I am so greatful. The music helps to inspire and sustain my faith in God 
I must say that it would be impossible to fit the best songs of Commissioned on one CD. I own all of the CDs that these songs were taken from and I must tell you that Commissioned has seen me through many days. One of the things that I like about Commissioned is that their message never changed with the changes in the Gospel industry. Jesus has always been the focal point of every song and praise that these brothers have made. I recommend that you hurry up and purchase this and all the rest of the CDs that Commissioned has done. Email me if you need a list of the albums 
The Be Good Tanyas are a triple threat, combining breathtaking harmonies, well crafted songwriting, and superb acoustic musicianship. My favorite thing about this band is the underproduction of their albums. There is very little overdubbing or polishing of the sound: you can hear them breathing into the mike, the sound of rain the background, etc.; this lends an intimacy to the songs that is both heartbreaking and gorgeous. Lyrically, the strongest song is "Song for R.", about loving others despite their flaws or addictions. Another high point is their cover of the Sean Hayes' tune, "A Thousand Tiny Pieces". The harmonies on this song and on the song "Human Thing" should stop traffic. In my opinion, the only weakness of the album is their affinity for traditional songs that one finds in dusty Smithsonian archives. When they perform traditional songs, they sound too confined and uninspired. Their rendition of "Out of the Wilderness" makes them sound like a chain gang auditioning for a cameo in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?". They are talented lyricists, as evidenced by some great songs on the album (Human Thing, Ootischenia, Hello Love, Song for R.). The hidden track of Prince's "When Doves Cry" is the only real disappointment on the album. I was looking forward to some amazing vocal pyrotechnics from all three members on this song, and I cannot understand why Frazey Ford performs this as a solo when the other two members are phenomenally talented at harmony vocals. Overall, this is a really lovely album that I have listened to nonstop lately, and each time I find something new to enjoy. 
What a treat it is to find a band like this. I'm the type of guy who will search for good bands on the internet, through reading reviews and such and I do believe I have found a great band here. The first song, Human Thing, will not leave my head. What a great song! Simple, direct and beautiful. The Be Good Tanyas also do a blazing and sultry version of Prince's "When Doves Cry". It's an amazing interpretation that changes the entire feel of the song but delivers it with the same urgency that Prince did. Prince no longer is the principal owner and I think he would be fine with that given what a great job The Be Good Tanyas have done. The album works from beginning to end and that's something to love 
I've had the new album "Hello Love" on repeat since I got it in the mail a few days ago. It's wonderfully atmospheric, lonesome and gorgeous. I think it stands up well to the previous albums, lending a bit more mature aspect to the alchemy. The only thing I am disappointed about is that their website hasn't been updated yet 
Every track on da CD is hott. Itz a good CD to ride to at night make love to. The girlz can sing their ass off. I really didnt know anything about these girls until 1 of my girls put me on to them i have had their CD play-n ever since. Like i said all the trackz are hott but my personal favorites are Get up on It, Surrender, Keep On. If you are think-n about get-n it-get it...you'll love it if u dont something wrong wit your earz. Not like-n this is like say-n 12 Play is wack u know everybody love 12 PLa 
Too bad this group supported by Keith Sweat didn't go any further. I bought it for one song, but the whole CD is great for listening. Lyrics contain songs about love and such, and I like they way speak about it. It gives you something to look forward to. 
These girls or Ladies are real real good and a whole lot better then most of these"girl groups" that were the norn back then.I put the among the "best" Brownstone SWV TLC Changing Faces Jade If you ain't on this list then theres a reason 
This cd still rocks I don't have mine anymore but I am going to get another one but this is a very nice cd not raunchy at all but just right I would tell anyone to get this cd. you can even still have your kids in the room while you listen to this I'm still young but this really reminds me of my teen years I use to be in a group and on our way to rehearsal I used to wear this album out!! 
ok,its bad for us girls to make sexual slow jams geared to guys.but its ok for us to make male bashing songs for girls?,what kinda femenistic hipocritical bull$hit is that?...............aren't both types of R exploiting the target demographic?(thats not to say that was kut klose's intentions) either way this is a great love making album,even if it was geared towards guys.i like,get up on it,lay my body down are all great headboard bangers.its obviousdly not aimed at girls but so what.i like it so thats all i care about really,i think it was probably the most overlooked R albums of the 90's,just due to the simple fact it was targeting guys.besides isn't that what destiney's child was doing in the begining when they was targeting girls with their ghetto azz male bashing chicken head songs like bills bills bills?............sheesh when will the hipocracy and double standards end 
This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on "Surrender" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex. "I Like" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose 
Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three. Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great. These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade. That's a good class to be in. 
"Creating this album of romantic songs has truly been a labor of love. I have never before experienced such unconditional dedication and commitment from so many different people, all working toward a single goal. Collaborating with Johnny Mandel is a dream come true. He is a genius, a tireless worker, a gentle soul and a lovable man. It has been a privilege to work with him. If you have the feeling that I had a ball doing this album, you're absolutely right!" ~ Michael Feinstein ~ This collaboration between Michael Feinstein and Johnny Mandel is one of the best-ever Feinstein recordings of all-time. Mr. Mandel, who is a brilliant composer/conductor/arranger and has done several film and television musical scores and known as one of the best Sinatra arrangers, did a superb job on the stunning arrangements. The Oscar-winning composer also produced this album and chose the best studio musicians in this project most notably one of my favorite pianists, Alan Broadbent. Presented in this "labor of love" album is a dozen of songs interpreted in sheer beauty and perfection. Mr. Feinstein has always been very resourceful in compiling songs that he would record and his musical knowledge is simply amazing. All his liner notes have been so informative and give accurate details about the origins of each song. He collected some of the best works from Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Larry Hart, Sammy Fain, Harry Warren, Jerome Kern, Burton Lane, and the Bergmans, among others, to offer another remarkable album not only for his fans but also for everyone who enjoys fine music. My top favorite from this collection is a sentimental gem of a song by Rodgers and Hammerstein, "No Other Love," a song I've been hearing from my parents' collection (versions from Perry Como and Ella Fitzgerald) when I was growing up and so glad to hear a new charming version with fabulous arrangement. I totally embrace and welcome new interpretations of nostalgic songs that now give new significance to life in general. Some of the choice cuts are "Isn't It Romantic," a medley of "I Can Dream, Can't I"/ "I'll Be Seeing You," "A Fine Romance" and "Wasn't It Romantic," a uniquely beautiful version, which showed-off his creative style of singing and his ear-catching vocal artistry. Mr. Feinstein is so privileged to be the first artist to record a meaningful song by Johnny Mandel/Alan and Marilyn Bergman "Where Do You Start?" It's a song that has the most poignant lyrics from this collection. "Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past? How do you deal with all the things you thought would last, that didn't last? With bits of memories scattered here and there I look around and don't know where to start . . . Which books are yours? Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine? Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine So many habits that we'll have to break And yesterdays we'll have to take apart . . . One day there'll be a song or something in the air again To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again A moment in what might have been Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry? Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you'll try. . . And though I don't know where and don't know when I'll find myself in love again I promise there will always be A little place no one will see A tiny part deep in my heart That stays in love with you."  You'll enjoy this CD. It's truly a labor of love. 
If you want to fully enjoy the grand nature of this CD, pour yourself a glass of VERY GOOD WINE, be sure it is poured into WATERFORD, lower the lights, light the fireplace, then sit down and enjoy!...You will be lost in the magic of this performance 
This Is The Cd That Made Me A Michael Feinstein Fan!! I Had Bought His Two Previous Cds And Liked Them Very Much, But The First Time I Heard "My Favorite Year" I Was Hooked!! I Was In Tears By The End Of The Song &amp; A Life Long Fan!!! Johnny Mandel's Arrangements Are Stunning And So Romantic!! One Of Michael's Very Best!!! 
While this is not my favorite album in my collection, I keep coming back to "You're an Education", a song that Feinstein dug out of the vaults. He has a knack for finding great tunes that were either lost by time or simply forgotten 
This is one of my all time favorite romantic cds. Though I have most of Michael Feinstein's cds, this one remains my favorite. Full of beautiful, classic love songs, this cd delivers sentimentality without being sappy. You can tell by all of Mr. Feinstein's cds that he genuinely loves the songs of early hollywood and broadway and it is apparent, most definitely, in this cd. If you are in the mood for love with your special someone and want a little background music, you should give this one a try 
This is one of my favorite of the Feinstein collection. Not only does he perform the title song beautifully, he follows up with "Wasn't It Romantic." It certainly was! He sets the mood for the game of romance with "I Won't Bring You Roses" but the accompaniment to this, "Time Heals Everything," spoke to me in a big way. Nick Clooney needs to hear "Wasn't It Romantic" so he can play it on his WSAI show in the early a.m. hours; says he likes Feinstein, but doesn't play enough of this fabulous performer's music. Romance is the game, and Feinstein is the master 
I received this 11 years ago when my first child was born. It is a wonderful alternative to traditional lullaby music. You could feel my daughter totally relax, while being rocked,danced or hummed to sleep. Unfortunately the cassette tape did not endure the endless playings( I now have 4 children)...so here I am ordering the CD. I am grateful it is still available. It has become a tradition 
So okay, I am a big sentimental goop! But we all are at times, and when you are feeling particularly sentimental and romantic, in my opinion, there is nothing better to wallow in than this album. Michael Feinstein puts everything on the line when he performs, and I for one, appreciate it, because he is not just technically talented, his voice and delivery have a direct line to my emotions. Do I feel manipulated? Nope. This man truly loves this music just as I do. I have been listening to this album for 10+ years and I still love it. Relax in a warm, soothing bath of sheer romance. He transcends sexual orientation, just as Johnny Mathis always did. Who cares? Romance is romance and no one does it better than Michael Feinstein 
i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
The CD contains a little bit of everything, but all songs familiar to my daughter 
My 3 year old requests to listen to this CD over and over again! It is fantastic since I know the words to all the songs too. I love singing and dancing around the house with my son to this CD. It is much better than laying around the house and watching another movie. What was even better was listening to this CD on our last road trip. I never heard a peep out of him except his singing! It is a MUST HAVE! 
As soon as we tell my daughter that we are going bye-bye, she asks if we could listen to Elmo (aka this CD. At 20 months she was singing along! It has all the great children's songs I remember. It has become one of our favorites from Sesame Street 
This right here is basically a Del Greatest Hits album from the two albums that hes realeased on Elektra records (No Need For Alarm (1993) and I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991)). Del would be dropped from Elektra around 1996 while he was recording "Future Development". Now I have a beef with Elektra Records ever since I found out about the situation with that K.M.D. album "Black Bastards". In addition, around '04/'05, they would be bought out by Atlantic Records, but before they go, they would try to make some money by putting out some greatest hits albums under their name from some of their major artists (Brand Nubian, Pete Rock CL Smooth, Busta Rhymes, and more). This Del Tha Funkee Homosapien album would be apart of this also. Now since he recorded two albums, Elektra would put some of the songs from them, as well as some rare 12" singles that were remixed that were not avaliable on the albums. The songs "Ahonetwo, Ahonetwo", "Mistdobalina", "Sleepin On My Couch" and "Dr. Bombay" were the funky tracks that would appear on the "I Wish My Brother George Was Here" and "Wack MC's" would appear on the "No Need For Alarm" album. Some of the remix tracks like "Catch A Bad One (remix)" and "Wrongplace (Cas remix)" would be good additions to this album (the origonals appeared on the "No Need For Alarm" album), although I don't think the remixes of the "I Wish My Brother..." album would amount to the origonals. Some of the unavailable tracks like "Burnt" (from the flipside of "Mistadobalina" single) features Casual and Souls Of Mischief thats good for many Hiero fans, while Pep Love and Q-Tip would join in for the track "Undisputed Champs", which is also pretty tight to listen to. I had a friend who had the "Judgement Night" soundtrack and the track "Missing Link" was on there as well as it is on here also. Well, there you have it. Basically a bunch of Del tracks while he was under Elektra Records before he was cut from the label. I'm not too mad at this, because Elektra just HAD to make some money on the stuff that they owned. Although I believed that some tracks could have been an addition to this here (like "Worldwide" and "No More Worries" from the No Need For Alarm album as an example), but at the same time they were to release some hidden, hard-to-find tracks that many fans spent long a time looking for. If you don't feel like or don't have the money to buy Del's first two albums, or if you own both album and want to hear some lost tracks that Del had, then get this here. Del has plenty more never released tracks he recorded around that time, that could be found on the Hiero Oldies album. In a nutshell and in response to the reviewer below me: Del had nothing to do with this album. He ended all his ties with Elektra records when he was cut from their roster around 1995/1996. This was all Elektra's cash in on one of their better acts before they were discontinued. But if you a Del fan, you knew that, didn't you 
What has Del seriously done for the music industry in the past 5-6 years? He releases Deltron 3030, one of the best hip hop albums of all time, and then drops off the face of the earth. I've seen him since at Hiero shows almost too drunk/high/whatever to even perform. I don't want to give the impression that I have never liked Del. In fact, Del has been one of my favorite emcees throughout my entire hip hop listening days. It is just a shame that I see him sell-out and release a "best of" album. Really Del...a "best of" album? Most people these days could probably make a better Del mix with the music they own on their very own computers. Unless Del is hard at work at some masterpiece finale album thats gonna rival the next Dr. Dre release and change hip hop forever, he's lost my support as a dedicated fan or even respecting individual. Don't buy this album. Don't download this album. If somebody tries to give you this album for free; fart for the time equivalent to 16 music tracks, then tell that person that what you have just done is more worth hearing than Del sell himself out through Elektra 
I remember around 1991, NBA Inside Stuff did a feature on B.J. Armstrong (my favorite player) of the Chicago Bulls. B.J. said that his favorite song was "Mr. Dobalina". I remember thinking, well, if B.J. Armstrong likes this guy named Del tha Funkee Homosapien, then he must be good. And yes, Del's first album "I Wish My Brother George Was Here" is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic. So I recommend that album over this one (it's cheap too). Del was at his creative peak with that first album; it featured great production from Ice Cube (back when Ice Cube made good albums instead of movies). Since then, his career's been a mixed bag. His CD's are very inconsistent. A Best Of CD is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd's. But I think you'd also be better off buying "Deltron 3030" and "I Wish My Brother George..." instead 
Like a lot of people, I never heard of Del tha Funkee Homosapien until Gorillaz came around in 2001. Who was that guy with the insane rap in Clint Eastwood and Rock The House? Eventually, I checked out his album: Deltron 3030. It featured Dan the Automator, another one of the top workers on the Gorillaz project. Deltron 3030 was, and still is, one of the best albums I've heard. Anyone who thinks rap is all about the bling best give that album a chance before turning it down. Deltron 3030 had great music, sick beats, and of course, the masterful lyrics that only Del could provide. So I checked out this album: The Elektra Years recently, and it's every bit as good as Deltron was, and another perfect introduction to Del's solo stuff if you haven't heard it yet. I'm no rap expert. Not by a long shot. I don't listen to many rappers, as the majority of what's out there today is pretty sad. Del, however, is an exception. His lyrics are smart, he doesn't swear every other word, and you won't hear any slow sappy raps about loved ones from him *loooks over at P. Diddy*. He's a pretty upbeat guy that doesn't stop to catch his breath. In fact, you can't hear him breathe in-between verses, like you can with so many other artists out there. And on The Elektra Years, you'll witness some insane rhymes. There are some things I didn't think were possible to rap about, yet Del's able to. At the same time, some catchy beats are playing- most of which sound like they're from the early 90s, when rap was making its presence known. Again, I'm no hip hop expert, or a Del historian, but you can definately tell that a lot of these were from earlier in his career. Horns are used a lot in the tracks, and they work. Whereas there's a horn overkill in early 90s raps (Rico Suave in particular), they aren't over used here. And you gotta love how he throws in some rock elements. A few tracks have a pure rock driven guitar added into the mix, making everything even more diverse. You know what? I'm going to stop this review. If you liked Del's work on Gorillaz, then there's nothing keeping you from enjoying his solo projects. I'm not going to try and spoonfeed everything to you about how awesome this man is. Some of my favorite tracks on this album (though all of them are good) are: -Mistadobalina -Dr. Bombay -Wrongplace -Ahonetwo, Ahonetwo -Sleepin' on my Couch -Eye Examination -Missing Link -The Undisputed Champs After this perfect best of collection, I'm wondering just how good his other, full albums hold up. Del tha Funkee Homosapien breaks the rap stereotypes, and here's to hoping that he continues puting out the good stuff. Bow before tha funkee one 
No self respecting del fan would buy this album. I bought it and didn't respect myself afterwards. Not the best sampling of del tracks, even for old school. Not to mention del has likened his time at elektra to being a slave on a plantation...in fact do yourself a favor go cop the album with that track- future development 
With this "Best of" collection, Elektra has done what I wish every record label would have the guts/brains to do: it opened the vaults to give us access to the infamous glut of "previously unavailable on CD" hip-hop tracks. Over half of the songs on this Del retrospective are remixes, b-sides, or soundtrack cuts that are difficult or impossible to find anywhere else on CD. I have many of these old remixes &amp; b-sides on cassette singles, and I am very happy to finally have crisp, clean digital copies to play, rip, and burn. You might fault the selection of songs dubbed "the best," but you can't fault the inclusion of so many rare and elusive treats. "The Undisputed Champs," "Catch a Bad One (Remix)," and "Burnt" are stand-outs, but there's really not a bad song on the whole disc. Yes, some of the remixes are disappointing--but, really, how could a remixer top the original versions of bonafide classics like "Mistadobalina" and "Dr. Bombay?" Impossible. Just be thankful that some doors have been opened to some previously lost and forgotten tracks. And let's hope that the trend continues. (Are you listening, Jive? Let's get a similar compilation of Souls of Mischief vaulted gems, okay? 
OH wow. This was my group back in the day. I loved Dont walk a way! Even though the radio played it every two seconds. I wanna love you was also my jam, and one woman and do right and don't ask my neighbor was also good. Wow the whole cd is good. What a rarity now a days. Jade is missed 
I believe this was one of the best albums of 1992. Don't Walk Away, I Wanna Love You, One Woman, and Looking for Mr. Do Right, were songs Urban radio kept in heavy rotation, (Radio and Records Magazines, year of 1992 and 1993). The slow songs on this album, as well as the uptempo songs are nice. And besides that, these ladies are nice to look at........ 
Jade was the group! They will always be, no matter how this whole so-called "music" industry slept on them, these girls were a talented bunch. I loved these girls when they first came out and I hope that some day, even though it's been over 10 years, that they reunite and put another good cd better than the first and second to show that they were the talened, savvy, upscale chicks that they were. Of course, the best songs on here are "don't walk away", the first song released from the group. This song was huge back then, and even when it's played today as a classic, it still gets people moving. "One woman" was a nice song too and sounds so good; the song that should have hit the radio airwaves but didn't was "give me what i'm missing" which is such a good, soft and lovely piece with sizzling lyrics and tunes. This proves, once again, that a lot of the time the best songs are the ones that don't get played on the radio and you won't hear until you get the cd. Thus, people should NEVER be closed-minded because that happens ALL THE TIME in the music scene. "Looking for Mr. Do Right" is another good song that should have gotten more play when it came out in the 1993. I loved the video to that song too!In conclusion, Jade was a phenomenal group that should have gotten the recognition and huge limelight they they deserved. No matter how long ago they were, Jade will always be the group 
At the time of Jade's debut, Jade To The Max, SWV was just hitting the scene as well. The trio are a lot more talented than their compitition, but fell off with some production issues. The upbeat production of their singles, "Don't Walk Away" and "I Wanna Love You", can very well have you feeling alive all of a sudden. Pleading for pleasure from lovers on "Give Me What I'm Missing" makes you think if there's something missing in your own relationship with this slow sexual groove. "Looking For Mr. Do Right" is another slow grinder completes the overall appeal to this release. Jade's debut calls on your emotional and listening pleasure by the moaning "I Want 'Cha Baby". There are a few fillers on this, but the songs that grabs you, captivates you 
Wow, I was looking through some old tapes (before CD's became popular) and here it was Jade. Popped it in while doing some housework. I had forgotten how much I had played these ladies during my high school years and with good reason. Unfortunately, these ladies didn't get a chance to make it to the top and show their true talents with all the competetion from other artist such as EnVogue, Brownstone, SVW, Xscape. Now I know why I still have this box of tapes---this was a good album. My favorites on this album--all of them. 
Jade opens up with a bang on their debut CD with a gang of hits like "I Wanna Love You"(featured on Class Act soundtrack), "Don't Walk Away", "One Woman", "Don't Ask My Neighbor", "Looking For Mr. Do Right"(my favorite track), "Blessed"(outstanding). This CD really put them on the map as an outstanding trio of vocalists with a seductive look especially in the video of "Don't Walk Away". These ladies after En Vogue was just as sexier with their look and personality. This and the second CD are a tie to me but their second CD was more balanced but what makes this CD good is the impact the songs above brings to the table. Jade will go down in the top of female R groups in my book for their voices and great professionalism 
Jade To The Max is a classic. The songs hold up after all these years. These girls can sing. Where are they now?? "Don't Walk Away" is a classic as is "Blessed". I keep going back to this CD and longing for the good old days. The girl groups of today, for the exception of En Vogue's new "Soul Flower", are pretty bad. These girls had "voices" and could harmonize beautifully. Grab this CD before it's really gone 
This is probably The Magnetic Fields most uneven release, but this is, of course, due to the fact that these are Merritt's first records. Most people seem to complain about the track order more than anything, but I can see why The Wayward Bus was put first. If Distant Plastic Trees were up first, most people probably would not be able to sit through the whole thing. Distant Plastic Trees feels very different from all other Magnetic Fields releases and comes across sounding more like Enya singing folk songs. Even worse, the synthesizers sound especially fake with some really annoying sound effects. That said, the songwriting here is still pretty good. To echo a similar theme other reviewers have noted, some of these songs would have been better if Merritt had just sung them himself, but Susan Anway is able to do things Stephin couldn't have. For example, listen to the clips for "Josephine" and "Tar-Heel Boy." The biggest annoyance here is the fact they left off "Plant White Roses" which was the best song on the album. Merge's compilation Six Rows of Teeth has a Merritt-sung version which is very good, but the Anway version is better. That was on the Harriet Records "Long Secret" compilation, which is (trust me) unavailable. The Wayward Bus is exponentially better than Plastic Trees. It is a brilliant tribute to Phil Spector. The synthesizers are reverberated, combined with real instruments, and put through filters, so they sound much more natural than Plastic Trees. It still sounds quite muddy though, but that's how it is supposed to sound. The songs are irresistibly catchy and the lyrics are less pretentious. There isn't a bad song in the ten as far as I am concerned. If you were wondering how Merritt's music got so good, this is an interesting start. This will help you understand just where this guy came from. Buy this for The Wayward Bus, but lower your expectations when you get to Plastic Trees 
I can't even get into a lengthly explanation - listening to all of the magnetic fields songs make me happy to be alive. simple 
I usually detest indie pop like this: low fi, precious, sentimentally gloopy songs with detached singing and little or no guts to the music. But damn if this doesn't work in an odd, magical way. The songs don't rock for sure, but the melodies and lyrics pack a delicate punch that can be either soothing, cathartic or just bittersweet. Songs for after the breakup with the love of your life 
This album snuck up on me. At first I thought it was terrible, for the reasons other reviewers have mentioned (blandish vocals, messy arrangements and noise) but I listened to it a little more and got to know the songs and appreciate all of them. The quirky poetry and the entire mood the album creates has come to mean so much to me, and it has truly become one of my favorite albums- odd, imperfect, and endearing. 
First of all, the ordering of the songs bugs me. The second album, 'The Wayward Bus' (c.1992), is placed before the first album, 'Distant Plastic Trees' (c.1991) on the CD. It's just a minor annoyance. Both albums are sung entirely by Susan Anway (formerly of the Boston punk group "V" in the early 1980s). She decided to move to to Arizona in 1991 and left the vocal duties to Stephin Merritt. He has wonderfully unique baritone voice, which is slightly reminiscent of Johnny Cash. The songs might have been better had he sung them. Anyway on with the review. Overall, 'The Wayward Bus' album is better than 'Distant Plastic Trees'. The only bad song on 'The Wayward Bus' is 'Toyko A Go-Go' (it's bad compared with the other songs on 'The Wayward Bus' and future albums.) High points on this album are 'Candy', 'Lovers From The Moon', 'Dancing In Your Eyes', and 'Jeremy'. Seperating the albums is an untitled silence track which goes on for 4 minutes and 32 seconds, which feels a bit too long (especially on repeated listenings). Now their first album. 'Distant Plastic Trees' is probably the weakest thing the Magnetic Fields has released so far(compared to other Magnetic Fields albums; it's much better than a lot of things out there at the time). High points are 'Railroad Boy', 'You Love To Fail', 'Tarheel Boy', and, of course, the college radio hit '100,000 Fireflies'. 'Kings' and 'Babies Falling' are okay songs, but the worst songs (compared to the other songs) on this album. Well, overall the CD is a good interesting listen, even if it cronicles the weakest period of the band in reverse. Keep in mind: This shouldn't be an introduction to the band. I suggest '69 Love Songs' for that 
Really pretty songs in an 80's synth-pop kind of way. Except they make me smile, not cringe (except "tokyo a go-go" which actually is pretty cringeworthy). They DON'T sound a thing like Berlin or Mister Mister, don't get me wrong... But the songs somehow DO give me the same goopy feeling I had when I was a lovesick twelve-year-old listening to those bands! Go on, be sappy, get this 
Slowdive is mainly known for their classic "shoegaze" albums "Just For a Day," "Souvlaki," and the less widely heard "Pygmalion." Great as they are, to my ears the band's early EP's contain their best music, and this compilation is the closest most people are ever going to get to those rare discs unless they're willing to spend a fortune on e-bay for the originals or can track down the recent import releases of "Just For a Day" and "Souvlaki" which contain all of their EP releases, plus the Peel Sessions, on bonus discs. Their early sound is heavier, with more reliance on overdriven guitars, controlled feedback, and occasional forays into beautiful, uncontrolled noise than their later stuff. Those who find their studio albums to be a little too soft and subdued will find little to complain about when listening to songs like "Slowdive" "Avalyn I" "Albatross" "So Tired" and the two versions of "Golden Hair" contained here. Not that you're getting speed metal. What you are getting is the most molten, blissed-out, wall of noise, floating-on-a-cloud sounds this side of heaven. Worth the price, in my opinion, for the first disc alone. Get it even if you have their full-length studio albums. I'm a latecomer to this band and discovered them through this album. It sounds very different, but seems to stem from the same creative ethos, as that which motivated the great Progressive bands of the early 70s. If you're a 40 something guy like me who loves early King Crimson and Genesis, and more recently Future Sound of London, MBV, Flying Saucer Attack, Bardo Pond type stuff, and you haven't heard Slowdive, you MUST give this a try 
I love all things shoegazing and, indeed, Slowdive perfected the sound. MBV might have technically started the engine (in some ways) but Slowdive really did it justice with lush, lush harmonies and gauzy, dream-like guitars and keys. All else under the moniker "shoegaze" is merely a shadow of their sound. That said this collection is a great overview of the band. (The one caveat here would be the exclusion of "Primal" from "Just For a Day". Even though the album wasn't as critically successful as "Souvlaki Space Station", "Primal", I believe, is the ideal shoegaze form. . .but no matter. . .) I do think that there is too much reliance on using the studio material from--especially their first two--full-length LPs. This is most prevalent on the second of the two-disk set. I would have liked more b-sides and rare material, but overall--and especially if you need to invest in one Slowdive album as an introduction--this is an excellent gem. Beautiful. 
Far too many "best of" compilations have a few of the bands hits and a disproportionate number of tracks from later, less popular albums that nobody really likes (perhaps in a futile attempt to persuade people to buy those albums). This collection definitely seems to have been put together by a fan of Slowdive, as it features most of their classics (almost the entire Souvlaki album is here) and quite a few obscurities and rarities. Admittedly, in Slowdive's short career there were very few tracks that aren't worthy of inclusion on a "best of" compilation :) If you're a fan of the band you probably have nearly all these tracks anyway, though the live cut of Golden Hair isn't something I've seen before - but it probably isn't worth $30 to me so I guess I won't be getting the compilation. If you're not a fan of the band, then this compilation is a pretty good place to start, or to fill in some of the gaps with ep/single only tracks - but if you don't own any Slowdive at all, you're probably best of picking up Souvlaki for much less $ and taking it from there : 
Not sure if you like Slowdive? This collection of songs, unlike most compilations does a wonderful job of showing you who this band is. In other words, If you don't like this collection you probably do not like Slowdive. This is Slowdive at there best, While it does lack a few great songs, overall it is pretty amazing. If you do like this set a lot, as a huge Slowdive fan I recommend hunting down all the CD's and EP's you can find. It may be difficult but if you like this material you will love just about everything you hear by Slowdive. In all my searches I have not found another band that even comes close to being as amazing as Slowdive. Most fans of Shoegaze music will tell you My Bloody Valentine is the best of the genre, while they are the originators of this style, Slowdive has perfected what they started. I am a big MBV fan but they just do not touch Slowdive. I highly recommend this album for new listeners of Slowdive, and also long time fans, as there is a lot of hard to find material on this album, and a live peel sessions version of Golden hair that will give you the chills. This music is so good it, it almost doesn't seem human. If your looking for more material by slowdive I would highly recommend these other albums: 1. Souvlaki (My Favorite) 2. Pygmalion (Out of print, but worth trying to hunt down. Try Ebay) 3. Just for a Day (not represent that well on this compilation) 4. Blueday (Also out of print, but this collection has most the songs) While Slowdive sadly no longer exists, most of the members have some great side projects, but none are quite as amazing as Slowdive. Check out The Monster Movie, Neil Halstead, Mojave 3, Rachel Goswell. Get this CD and get into the greatest, underated band ever! (P.S. Souvlaki Space Station is the best Song you'll ever hear! 
I can listen to this every day , especially when I need a pick-me up. These guys rock I can't wait to hear what they come out with next! 
Down To Earth Approach is a really good Punk Rock band that the majority of people can enjoy. This album has me hooked. I listen to it almost every day. If you like Bayside, Achange Of Pace, Armor For Sleep... An music like that you will love this album 
I seriously can not forget about this album. I always come back to it. Probably listen to at least one song a day. Whenever I am sad or just need some energy I put this album in and it lifts me right up. It's impossible to not enjoy this album 
Just testing. By the way, this is a 5/5 album. Saves the day with an edgier sound 
I was--and still am--a huge Superdrag fan. John's solo album does have a hint of the flavor of Superdrag, but don't buy it because you think it picks up where Vitriol left off. This is a no-holds-barred Christian album, and if you don't want to smacked upside the head by the praise of Jesus, you won't enjoy this album. 
This is a great record. A must for any Superdrag fans, but an even bigger must for those of you who listen to Christian music. This has got to be THE album of Christian rock for 2005, probably for many years before. It has a quality of music unmatched in the genre (think Beach Boys, Beatles, Superdrag of course) and the lyrical honesty of Keith Green. Its awesome 
If you enjoy classic rock from the 60's, and you're a Christian or you at least admire the Christian faith, then this album is a must-have. Every song is immensely enjoyable and Davis sounds completely sincere in every musical note and every word he sings. The highlight for me is: Jesus Gonna Build Me a Home, which is an achingly beautiful song. All-around grade: A+. 
This is an amazing album, if you can get past the religious overtones! I'm not a christian and I do not agree with some of the lyrics on the album but you can look at it this way, George Harrison's amazing solo debut "All Things Must Pass" also has religious overtones, but you can quickly look past the lyrics and enjoy the music and the beautiful melodies. The same can be said for John's first album. The album reminds of "All Things Must Pass", "Pet Sounds", and Superdrag's "In The Valley Of Dying Stars". Like I stated before, don't let the "Christian Rock" label make you pass on this album. It truly is a beautiful album. And yes it does have some hard rockin' Superdrag like songs (ie. Nothing Gets Me Down!!). So do yourself a favor and purchase this album. 
So, I'm a "Head Trip..." "Regretfully..." -era Superdrag fan who has been doing the "I wonder where they are now" thing lately and discovered two additional Superdrag records "In the Valley of the Dying Stars" (2000) and "Last Call for Vitriol" (2002) which I was happy to find and purchase. I liked what was happening with "Last Call..." and still need to give "In the Valley..." more time. BUT, BUT, BUT!!!!! I checked out John's solo albums and HOLY MOSES (no pun)!!! What a great album! Now, I grew up around christian music and had some local band faves that were christian rock, but this John Davis record is amazing even if it were I-worship-the-dustbunny-under-my-bed rock. John's writing and performance is capturing his best moments in Superdrag ON EVERY SONG! What a solid, solid, solid effort here. I am so psyched 
These days, Christian music just doesn't do much for me. It either comes off too preachy or just too abstract and makes you wonder why the artist didn't just go secular to begin with. Being a HUGE Superdrag fan, I was somewhat reluctant to hear this release. Now that I have heard it, it is mind-blowingly (is that a word?) good. Arguably, if John Lennon had been a devout Christian when he put out the Plastic Ono Band album it may have sounded very similar to this. Don't get me wrong, Davis makes no bones about his new faith and direction, this is blatantly spiritual. But the songs on here are among his very best against the Superdrag catalog. The production is great and his voice is exceptional. Do yourself a favor...Christian or otherwise, pick this up soon. It is a power-pop masterpiece. 
What a fantastic record. In college, I was a fan of Superdrag. They were supposed to be one of the next big things! So ,when I heard that their ex-frontman had a solo CD, I was very interested in hearing it. And the fact that he had parted ways also with his partying rock-n-roll lifestyle, and found God intrigued me even more! The album does not let you down! From the first to last track, it is pure pop and rock magic! John wears all of his influences on his sleeve, but always adds his own wonderful flavor to his creation. Traces of Brian Wilson, Tom Petty, Matthew Sweet, Badfinger...all seep from this album, but with a new orginality that breathes life into your stereo. I truly think it is one of the best albums I've heard all year! He proclaims his faith boldly, yet his music is completely approachable for even the most faithless! Sadly, he will probably never be embraced by the Christian music community, due to the fact that they simply cannot handle something so artistic, honest and original. And the rest of the music world just might be scared enough by his Christian lyrics that he won't get the radio time he richly deserves! DO NOT BE ONE OF THESE FOLKS!!!!!! This album is musical bliss! It will fill your head with harmony and happiness, so please give a tragically underated and unknown musician a chance. I doubt you will find disappointment 
If you like The Beatles or rock n roll, in any capacity, you NEED to have this CD in your collection. It is simply incredibly and horrifically impressive. John Davis is a music genious as plays almost 20 insturments himself on this record. An incredible deal for such powerful and amazing music 
I put the new solo CD from ex-SUPERDRAG singer JOHN DAVIS in my player with some trepidation, but no matter - upon first listen, all is well with the world. No matter your religious bent, you cannot deny the sheer power, pop craftsmanship, music chops, and authentic HEART of these songs. While I'm a big fan of gospel music, due to Davis' uncompromising lyrical stance (i.e. vulnerable, honest, dare I saw SPIRITUAL content), most if not lal of these songs will have a hard time getting on MTV2, much less college/rock radio playlists. Still, this is truly a deeply-felt album if there ever was one, Davis' new direction might alienate many of his old fans, but TRUE longtime fans of SUPERDRAG will gladly come along for the ride - from the plaintive opener I HEAR YOUR VOICE to fuzzed-out rave-ups like TOO FAR OUT, this is rich, affecting, powerful stuff that reminds you just how SOULFUL rock roll can be - and how SOUL-LESS most of pop/rock music is. This terrific CD deserves to be much, much higher on the sales rank than 16,000+?! Buy one today! Support John Davis 
John Davis has created a pop gem with his first solo album, a collection of tunes that erupt from the depths of his heart. Embracing religion and finding meaning in his life was the greatest thing to ever happen to his craft. A smooth transition from song to song, the diversity found in each track make the listneing experience enjoyable on each turn. Although the Christian rock scene may have a hard time excepting something as original and different as this, long time rock fans a Superdrag fans alike will find something to cherish about this album. AMAZING spirituallity transfused with rock AND roll 
You really can't appreciate American Rock of the late '60's without acknowledging the important role of this band. From southeast Oklahoma, they stood little chance of mainstream acceptance, but one catchy tune - "Western Union" briefly filled the top Billboard spot. This collection underscores how much more potential was there. I knew, even played (with my own "garage band") a lot of these tunes when they were current, and it is an exciting piece of history. I am pleased to be able to hear them again now 
I tend to think of the FA's as a one-hit wonder -- which they were -- though I always liked that one hit: "Western Union" was a fine, fine pop song. This disc, however, brings to light the other, surprisingly enjoyable music that followed, as the band struggled to build on their commercial momentum. They shamelessly repeated the riffs and motifs of that song in follow-up singles ("Zip Code," for example), but they also delved into a rich lode of melodic pop, and this generously programmed, 25-song retrospective gives a nice, balanced view of their work from 1965-69. Of course they eventually shed their clean-cut image and got all druggie and psychedelic, and that's certainly half the fun. Recommended 
U2's latest album is best music and has some of the greatest songs featuring Vertigo, Love and Peace, and City Of Blinding Lights. Buy this great latest album. Bono writes good lyrics 
It's not that bad. While I agree that it's nothing spectacular, it's nothing that will change your life, and it's nothing that will redefine U2's career, it's really what we should be coming to expect. This is a pretty standard U2 album. I know that makes a lot of you cringe, but think about it: they've been a band since the late 70s, they've made some of the best albums in Rock and Roll (if they had only made Achtung Baby and the Joshua Tree, let's face it, they'd still be one of the greatest Rock bands there are), they're in their 40s, they have children, and Bono is around the world engaging the world in some pretty serious things (which is actually kinda Rock and Roll in the most U2 of ways). A lot of purists would suggest that U2 hang it up, that their career has run its course. But think about it, is there really anything wrong with standard U2? I am happy with standard U2, and I think they deserve to settle down a little. That means not trying to redefine U2, not trying to create a new U2, they've done that enough. They deserve to be U2, and give us U2 fans what we want. "I'll give you everything that you want/except the thing that you want," Bono sings on the album's centerpiece, and I think that thought could apply to those of us that wanted something radical. That being said, the aforementioned line comes from a radical U2 song, an anthem as majestic as anything preceeding it. "Yahweh" is Bono as his most Bono, and I have to admit I have a soft spot for Bono being Bono. The only inherently lame track is "All Because of You." The remaining ten are never less than catchy, never less than good songs. Why isn't that enough? When the Best Ofs came out I remember thinking that the B-sides were a different kind of U2. While the songs didn't exactly push the band forward, they were always good and certainly interesting. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is sort of an album of B-sides. These are great songs, interesting ideas although less than spectacular lyrically. It doesn't fail to be interesting even if it never quite acheives an album feel. That being said, for standard U2, it's not certainly not that bad 
Well, I'm less than impressed upon wrapping up a listen to this album. While it has a few standout tracks among the 11 provided, for the most part they are all mediocre. I was never a fan of `Vertigo' but I am a fan of U2 so I opted to give the entire CD a listen, and while the remaining singles `City of Blinding Lights' and `Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own' are classic U2 and wonderful listens, songs like `Original of the Species' and `Love and Peace of Else' really bring down the value of the CD. Some of these tracks serve their purpose. `Miracle Drug' quickly redeems the album after the dreadful opener `Vertigo' but `Love and Peace of Else' and `All Because of You' quickly knock it back down, and while `A Man and a Woman' struggles to be ballad worthy the following four tracks end the album in complete turmoil. `Yahweh' has Bono coming off as an out of tune karaoke refugee and ends the album on such a sour note I'm almost forced to swear if off forever, but I won't do that, because they're U2 and on name alone they were saved, this time 
Been listening to U2 for a long time now and consider myself a fan of their work. For me this album is one of their best, if not their best beside Joshua Tree 
When U2 comes out with a new album, the anticipation and expectations are extremely high. This album did not disappoint. In October 2004, Vertigo was everywhere from ipod commercials to radio play. It was a hard rocking sound that made me so excited for the album to come out. When I bought the cd, I listened to it over, and over, and over. I am one of the biggest U2 fans out there and it takes me repeated listening to approve of their their new album. To sum it up, Original of the Species I believe is the standout track. It's probabaly one of their most beautiful songs ever recorded along with Stay, All I Want is You, and With or Without You. Other great tracks on the album are Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, Yahweh and City of Blinding Lights. Overall a great album, but not their best. If you want U2's best album where every song just flows, then you must buy 1991's Achtung Baby 
I have been a fan of U2 since they released their mega-hit record "the Joshua Tree" ...and since the first time I heard it, I have been a fan of them ever since... AND HAVE NEVER, EVER STOPPED BEING A FAN!!!!! So many people have critisized them because of the many paths they've taken, the risks, the changes, the experiments, but each and every single one of those steps has made them who they are right now: the most honest, bold, charismatic, energetic and emotionally commited band of the modern rock scene. They are not a name, a brand, an empty shell: THEY ARE SOUL!!! And I think that this record cleary serves as an example of what they are able to communicate to millions around the world trascending the barriers of language, culture, religion or economic status... HTDAAB is an album that takes time...it's not easily absorbed just by playing it once...which is perhaps what makes it so endering and deep... it's an album that speaks in the flow of the lyrics, echoed by the rhythms and the unmistakable touch that Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry use to sign every track...They have not lost the boldness and fierce lyrics of WAR or THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, but rather, they've chanelled them using different elements for both their sound and their lyrics... I have heard so many "so called" fans who rip their robes saying how much the band has "evolved" but...THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT..if it is produced for the right reasons...music, TRUE MUSIC, is only created by being born as part of the musician's very core, thus growing and changing with him, not by being manifactured as an easily consumed product like so many bands or pseudo pop stars have diluded themselves into thinking...I'm HAPPY, GLAD, THRILLED U2 has evolved and has had the guts NOT TO REPEAT THEMSELVES...all these "fans" keep on pressing for the band to come up with an ACHTUNG BABY part 2 or THE JOSHUA TREE volume 2 but what they don't realize is that such is not possible because that time has passed, the 4 people who created those records have matured and are the MAGNIFICENT, CONFIDENT, DARING, STILL POLICALLY ACTIVE BAND we can enjoy today, without being a mere caricature of what they were back then... so I ask all of those who have only critized them for what they are not, HAVE YOU ACTUALLY TAKEN THE TIME TO LISTEN, REALLY LISTEN TO THIS RECORD????!!!!! I really still find it hard to understand why it would be considered as lacking or weak after hearing tracks like "Sometimes you can't make it on your own", "A Man and A Woman" or "Yahweh"...not only do they capture the inner experiences of their members, but also serve as a way to communicate just what the band has gone through and continues to experience as an entity who has lasted longer than many marriages nowadays...28 YEARS TO BE EXACT since their first sessions inside Larry's kitchen back in their home town of Dublin... To not be affected by this record is to be either, in my opinion, close-minded about the possibilites of what A TRUE ROCK BAND SHOULD BE ABOUT or more importantly, to the creativity of these 4 individuals...This record is not about what the fans think of the band, but what the band thinks of themselves and the world they live in...Not political enough? How about "Love and Peace" or the "Miracle Drug"??? If someone is not capable to be touched by these two anthems calling attention to the state of chaos and indifference we live in nowadays, I really don't think they should even try to call themselves a fan of this band because then they don't REALLY understand what U2 is about. It's a very well balanced album, with tracks that highlight the magical guitar ability of the Edge like "City of Blinding Lights" or "Crums from your Table" and expose the perfect harmony between Adam's base and Larry's powerful drums... If it weren't for the fact that Bono, and even the Edge, have mastered lyric composition to such a rich point, the sound the band produces would almost be in danger of overpowering the words...but such is not the case, on the contrary, the lines come at the perfect time, each one entwined with other, like it happens with the second verse in "A Man and A Woman": ...But you can't be numb for love, the only pain is to feel nothing at all, how can I hurt when I'm holding you"....or by the end of "Original of the Species": ..."And you'll never be alone...Come on now, show your soul, You've been keeping your love under control"...or in "One Step Closer":..."I'm on an island at a busy intersection, I can't go forward, I can't turn back..." If you are someone new to their sound, spend time with the CD and REALLY pay attention to the lyrics...view them more as a dialogue between you and them rather than a speech they are trying to deliver...and immerse yourself in the sound completely. If you are a long time fan then I'm sure that whatever I've written somehow echoes your own opinion...and if you still continue to feel like this record is not what U2 "used to be" well...it's your loss...thank goodness is not ours : 
With their second in a series of two releases by the Lincoln, Nebraska band For Against, the Words On Music label takes another notch out of the rare CD ebay market by offering up the groups long out-of-print second album December. Just last year, the label gave their debut Echelons (which was only released on LP originally) a grand welcome back into the world, and December is now being given a similarly fancy treatment. In addition to being packaged in a nice two-fold digipack, the album has been remastered and even features two little-seen videos from the group. Although Nebraska has now become a musical hotspot because of Saddle Creek Records, one has to admit that the group sounded pretty far ahead of their time considering the original album release date of 1988. Absorbing influences as wide as Factory Records, early REM, and even some touches of the 4AD catalogue, it's as if the trio from the midwest distilled down what they liked about all the cutting edge groups that they listened to at the time and arrived at something that still sounds pretty fresh nearly 20 years later. The album bursts out of the gate with "Sabres," and Harry Dingman again makes his presence on guitar known right away with soaring melodies that mix nicely with the light delivery of Jeffrey Runnings on vocals (and backed by a solid rhythm section). In fact, one can almost hear a bit of an English lilt on the vocals of Runnings, as if he were looking to separate himself from the heartland even more than the music already does. As if to emphasize things even more, the following track "Stranded In Greenland" contains even more vague vocals that may or may not be a metaphor for the flyover state. If one were to remove the vocals of Runnings from "The Effect," the ultra-gauzy guitars and an almost electronic-sounding rhythm section running in 6/8 time could easily provide the backdrop to an early Cocteau Twins track while the title track of "December" echoes the dark early period work of The Cure instrumentally. For me, the first two albums from For Against were easily their best. Although they had some excellent songs in their latter period, they sound much more lively and willing to try different things (partially due to the excellent guitar work of Dingman, who later went on to play with The Millions). Considering the group is back together and playing again in their original lineup (albeit with a different drummer), they could very well make a resurgence on the heels of these excavations. (from almost cool music reviews 
This is probably my 2nd favorite soundtrack behind 8 Mile. It is worth every penny just for the song Go To Sleep which is probably one of my favorite rap songs ever. Most of the rappers really brought their game to this album and it is about 1/3 great songs, 1/3 decent songs, and 1/3 dissappointing songs. The best ones are X Gon' Give It To Ya, Go To Sleep, What's It All For?, Right/Wrong, Getting Down Drop Drop. (Every song with DMX on here is outstanding). The mediocre songs are Follow Me Gangster, Won't Be Coming Back, I'm Serious, Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Stompdash, Slangin' Dem Thangs both Jinx songs. The bad songs are Do Sumptin, Fireman, C2G, My Life, Focus. Overall, the good outweighs the bad and most of the songs are good to very good. Definately reccommended 
This is a very good soundtrack and a a must have for DMX fans. 1.X Gon Give It To Ya-DMX-5/5-The only single on the CD, one of my favorite DMX songs 2.Go To Sleep-Eminem, DMX Obie Tryce-5/5-Great beat, hot verses by all 3, and the only flaw is Em's annoying chorus, but his verse makes up for it 3.What's It All For-Bazaar Royale-1.5/5-Maybe even worse than D12's Bizarre (lol), horrible beat, annoying chorus and the verses are pretty bad 4.Follow Me Gangster-G-Unit-5/5-50's verse is OK, Yayo's verse is better, and Banks' verse gives this song 5 stars, great beat too 5.Stompdash**outu-CNN MOP-5/5-Love the beat great verses from Capone NORE the Mash Out Posse 6.Do Sumptin-Comp-4/5-Very good production, Comp's got a great flow , and a bunch of his songs such as Get In2 It Harder have been released under the radar, but no solo album release date? 7.My Life (Cradle 2 The Grave)-Foxy Brown Althea-3/5-This song is pretty good, Foxy shows that she hasn't lost it, but the production is subpar 8.Fireman-Drag-On-4.5/5-Great production by Elite, and Drag-On's flow is great. The chorus is based on Ice T's Im Your Pusher 9.Drop Drop-Joe Budden-5/5-First heard this song in NBA Live 2003 (even though it was an NBA remix), great beat and definately one of Joe Budden's best songs lyrically 10.I'm Serious-5/5-Clipse-Definately a standout track on this album, kinda weird hearing a Clipse song without Neptunes production, but Malice Pusha T are great MCs. 11.Right/Wrong-DMX-5/5-Another great DMX song, as I said, this is a must have for DMX fans 12.Its Gon Be What Its Gon Be-Jinx Loose-4/5-Suprisingly good song from 2 virtually unknowns 13.Hand That Rocks The Cradle-Big Stan-4/5-Good production, and Big Stan's flow is great on this one 14.Won't Be Coming Back-Big Tymers-5/5-Great beat by Mannie Fresh (obviously) and Baby does a great job pretty much rapping by himself, with Fresh doing like a quarter of a verse and the chorus 15.C2G-Fat Joe Young'n Restless-5/5-Wow, I was especially surprised with this one with great production, nice verse from Fat Joe and more basically unheard artists shine in Young'n Restlees 16.Focus-Kashmir-3.5/5-Kashmir sounds like her style is biting off of Eve, but her flow is pretty tight over an OK beat 17.Slangin Dem Thangs-Profit-4.5/5-Great production, and another young artist shows very promising skills 18.Off The Hook-Jinx Da Juvy-4/5-Good beat ANOTHER new rapper shows good lyrical ability 19.Getting Down-DMX, Big Stan, Kashmir Bazaar Royale-4.5/5-I wish DMX did a verse, but Big Stan and Kashmir hold it down nice lyrically, with Bazaar Royale singing again (....) Avg. Song Rating:4.3/ 
This may be in fact the best rap soundtrack I have ever heard - if not in the top 3 or 5 for sure. DMX has himself or his bloodline cohorts on about half of the songs and the other ones have some of the bigger name rappers out of NY and elsewhere. There are about 2 weak tracks but a lot of hardcore bangers make up for the couple that are below par. This is a must have rap cd as it is a definite classic and a great cd, you won't be disappointed. #1 - 10 (classic upbeat track by: DMX) #2 - 9.5 (DMX, Eminem, Obie Trice) #3 - 4 (Bazaar Royale) #4 - 9.5 (G-Unit) #5 - 10 (classic by: Capone-N-Noreaga M.O.P) #6 - 8.5 (from B-More teen: Comp) #7 - 5 (Foxy Brown f/ Althea) #8 - 8.5 (Drag-On over a 70's type disco beat) #9 - 7.5 (joe Budden) #10 - 8.5 (Pusha T Malice {CLIPSE}) #11 - 9.5 (DMX - convo w/ his conscious) #12 - 8.5 (Jinx Loose) #13 - 8.5 (Big Stan) #14 - 8.5 (Baby - has a catchy hook) #15 - 10 (classic from the unknown Young N'Restless f/ Fat Joe) #16 - 7 (kashmir) #17 - 8 (the unknown Profit #18 - 9.5 (jinx da Juvy) #19 - 7.5 (Big Stan, DMX, Kashmir, Bazaar Royale 
It's good to see DMX back in the mix. He's one of only a few rappers today that has that raspy voice that commands attention. He gets thins going on the soundtrack's single `X Gon' Give It To Ya'. Solid track overall - good hook, lyrics, beat, and overall production. DMX is featured on four of the 19 tracks on this album. Track 2 is a personal favorite of mine. It features an Eminem, Obie Trice, and DMX collaboration that will hype up any crowd and it even makes reference to Ja Rule, whom the Shady Records camp and DMX have been feuding with these past months. These three rappers do an excellent job complementing each other on this high-energy track. Foxy Brown, Joe Budden, M.O.P., 50 Cent, are also featured on this soundtrack. It'll be sure to give you that those raw vocals you've been looking for. One of the few soundtracks I have picked up in a long time 
if you are a hip hop&amp; rAp fan this soundtrack will give you what you need. Plenty of the song are great in this album. if have to chose the best one i will write sooo many of the song names. But DMX's X GON' GIVE IT 2 YA is the best of these bests. Also other DMX songs are great too. In short this soundtrack is the first best rap soundtrack.. 
the 2006 edition of the warped tour compilation is totally cool, you have great bands like Moneen and Anti-Flag, 51 bands for $8 totally rocks 
I was reading through these reveiws trying to see which songs I should listen to first ( I can't ever just dive into a cd, I need someone to tell me where to start) and I started to get really ticked off. People are complaining about bands not being "punk" enough and the tour having lost its credibility. Well, news flash people. Its about the MUSIC not the LABLES WE PUT ON IT! If you want to hear some music that is rock, punk, gypsy, screamo, emo...just about any type of rock, you've got it here. I bought the '05 comp. and I loved it. It even led me to some great bands and I went out and bought their cd's so that I could hear more of them. If you want to taste a little of everything, for dirt cheap, 8 bucks..51 bands..come on, even I-tunes can't beat that. This is def a CD for those who get in the pool at the shallow end and slowly walk deeper. Heck! Its for those who dive right in! Its about the MUSIC, not LABLES! BUY IT! You won't regret i 
the popularity of punk has obviously caused it to evolve into a handful of sub-genres that the hardcore "punkers" will sneer at. But the warped tour has succesfully captured all aspects of these on this compilation. Usually compilations of this nature sound choppy and thrown together, but this one runs smooth and is well balanced. I know it'll be spending alot of time in my cd player this summer. 6 bucks for 51 bands, how can you go wrong 
I have not heard this CD yet but...Moneen is on it and Moneen rocks my world. So check this CD out because Moneen is on it 
wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a "punk" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this "nu-emo" trend is. now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure. all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi. bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened 
Common's "Like Water For Chocolate" was in my opinion his second best album he came out with. This was my first album I bought by him. When he came out with "The Light" somewhere in 2000, I really kept a close watch on him, because his rhymes really made my head nod. Listening to "Like Water For Chocolate" most of the production was very soulful, something that Common fans were starting to get used to hearing from him after the previous "One Day It'll All Make Sense" album. Common's rhymes on this album are excellent. Listening to him on the song "Doonit", Common can really spit some flames. On the song "A Song For Assata", Common tells a short bio of a black panther named Assata Shakur, with a nice sounding beat that works perfectly. Guest wise is awesome. This was the first time I gotten into Jay-Dee (R.I.P.) production which is on some of this album. Jay Dilla would also help Common with the chorus on the song "Heat". Roots' members Black Thought and Rahzel would do the chorus to "Coldblooded". Mos Def would come and spit some rhymes for the song "Questions". DJ Premier produces the best song on here "The 6th Sense" which is one of the best songs I've heard from Common. MC Lyte and Common would play the pimp prostitute roles by swaping verses on the song "A Film Called Pimp". Bilal would song the chorus to two songs "Nag Champa" and "Funky For You". The latter song would also have Jill Scott as well. Macy Gray (or D'Angelo...depending on when you bought this) would hook up for the third single "Geto Heaven". And Slum Village comes in for the song "Thelonious". Some of the guests were not on point (i.e. Slum Village), but they make a great addition to the album. Oh, I can't forget his pops Lonnie Lynn on the song "Pap's Rap III". I actually enjoy those tracks, if you ask me. As I said before Common dropped a dope album in 2000. People say this is the best album he's made. I agree so, in his mature state, but it would be hard to top the classic "Ressurection" which dropped back in 1994. Although if you want to hear some soulful hip hop, as well as being a fan of Common music, this is one album you cannot pass up. Soulful production, and some nice rhymes, it's hard to go wrong with this one. Lyrics: A+ Production: A Guest Appearances: B+ Musical Vibes: A Overall: A Favorite Tracks: Time Travelin (Both the original and reprise), Coldblooded, Doonit, The Light, Funky For You, The Questions, The 6th Sense, A Film Called Pimp, Nag Champa, Thelonious, Geto Heaven, A Song For Assata Honorable Mention Track: Pop's Rap III Favorite Common Albums From Best To Worst: 1.

This is about as pure as hip-hop gets. Real, unadulterated beats, eloquent verses, and fresh hooks make this album an instant classic. The fact that this album flies under the radar shows how misguided pop culture is. "It's the questions. It's the questions, girl. It's the questions. It's the questions, come on.. 
Soulful, meaningful, classic are all words that will describe this release. You can tell when an artist puts his heart and soul in the lyrics of a song because it comes off dope as hell and becomes classic material. That is exactly what common did. He followed the formula of making a classic album and put some chi town flavor in it. If you don't have this one your collection is suffering 
Common is one of the best rappers hands down. I think this CD is good but "Like Water for Chocolate" is sicker. One track that you heads need to hear is a white label edit on vinyl by Karu featuring Common called "Faces on the Mural". This is deep house at it's finest with the ripe vocals of Common. You guys should check out Karu's "Amazing Place" CD for some great deep jazzy house trip-hop. Wow! I can't believe it. I just bought the Illform "Next Level Fusion" Quentin's Ladder "Delusion" on here and realized Quentin Allen produced all these including Karu "Amazing Place". Don't be fooled! This definitely is not Quentin's first CD. It is the third CD and maybe the best. People need to check out this music. The jazz hip-hop influences are all there and come together nicely. My favorite track is "Out to Get Mine" Hot EPMD vocal snippet. Another great track is "Sketch the Play". You'll here a great texture of sounds too. Rhodes acoustic pianos, synths, deep basslines, great vocal samples, tight house beats, awesome jazz solos and nice chords. The Karu sound is like deep house by Hanna, Office Gossip, Miguel Miggs, and Chuck Love. If you want to here a great producer at work, get Quentin Allen latest offering "Amazing Place". 
If I had to choose one hip hop album for someone who'd never heard hip hop before, and ask them to listen to it: I would choose this one. This is probably, along with "Things Fall Apart" by the Roots, the best hiphop album in my catalogue and certainly the best album of 2000. From the beautiful Africanesque opening (with the sounds of the ocean and some nice layered trumpet playing from Roy Hargrove) to the touching ending (Common gets a little help from his father)... this album hits all the right spots. It's classy, it's classic. And it can rock out too, which is a nice touch. "BE" is a good album, but I find it a bit boring compared to "Like Water". This album serves up just enough variety to keep the listener interested, and just enough of the solid boombap to allow you to lose yourself in the experience 
Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as it is similar in a way as they all are very good friends as seen in chapelles block party. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's "Block Party" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com @ Your Local Record Shop 
"Like Water For Chocolate" finds the perfect balance of lyricism and musicality, which is elusive these days. With the music end in the hands of Jay Dee, there's no doubt that the beats will be unbelievable. With Common taking charge lyrically, there's also little doubt that he'll produce a quality product, and he did. Anyway, awesome album, if you like hip hop, you must own it, or feel like less of a person. buy it buy it buy it buy i 
Rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity. Its not real hip hop. This album, brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop. Honestly, The Light is a song that never gets old, thats real. If you don't have this album, get it. 
GOOD ALBUM COMMING CLOSE TO THE SECOND ONE RESURECTION...CLOSE,BUT MAYBE NOT CLOSE TO SOME. I LIKE THIS ALBUM OUT OFF ALL THE ONE'S HE MADE 
I bought this album right after I bought Be. Be is, hands down, a solid album that anyone can listen to from start to finish. It just has Kanye's greasy hands all over it, which is too much for me. I must say, this album is a refreshing change from the hip hop you hear everyday. "The Light" is a solid song. If you are a hip hop fan and find yourself getting winded and tired of the crap that is being put out right now, cop this album. It's more than worth the 8 or 9 dollars you will spend. 
This might be Cheap Trick's best album since Dream Police. Robin Zander is one of the top ten greatest rock and roll singers...ever. This album contains catchy, heavy pop-rock by one of the greatest living rock bands. Support the band. BUY IT 
Yup, this is IT! If you want to recommend just one post-1980 Cheap Trick album to someone, "Rockford" is THE obvious choice 
If, like me, you had lost track of Cheap Trick over the years, THIS is the reason to come back and discover what a GREAT band they are!!! There are NO duds on this album. Each track is a prime example of power pop and good rocking at it's finest 
It's hard to believe that after 16 albums spanning a 30 year career, the band that set the blueprint for modern pop-rock is still doing it better than anyone else. Self-produced and released through the band's own Cheap Trick Unlimited label, Rockford (dubbed after the Tricksters northern IL hometown) is a near flawless contemporary classic rock album, brimming with easy going and heavy hitting rock'n'roll melodies. Fresh and relevant as ever, Robin Zander and co. have crafted one of the best records of their career by doing what they do best: sticking to their guns without compromise while consistently writing the world's greatest rock and roll songs. Every track on Rockford just feels and sounds good, inside and out. The album's unapologetically cheerful verses and choruses exist in a world where life's little hardships cease to be, and contentedness can be found on a front porch beneath a starlit summer sky. From the hard rock anthem Welcome to the World to the seventies-ish ballad O Claire to the groove-laden, ZZ Top inspired One More, Rockford maintains a consistent, upbeat, and undeniably catchy series of melodies from start to finish. Cheap Trick are are the anti-Rolling Stones. Somehow they manage to become better and more relevant as they get older 
"All Those Years"-- Track 11; listen to it. Then listen to everything else. You will truly understand how unfair the music business is when such a gem of a CD is snubbed... 
This is without a doubt one of Cheap Tricks greatest albums. This time they've got it. Once again this record proves that although most rock can seem formulaic great music smashes the formula within any genre. The songwriting is fantastic, the lyrics have great meaning within the band, everyone is playing with a ferver not heard in bands of this age in years. With the death of John Entwhistle of The Who the mantle of rock's greatest bass player who isn't Paul McCartney passes to Tom Petersson. As the only person on the planet to ever master the instrument he helped invent, the twelve string bass, his playing on this CD is majestic. If you only buy one CD this year make it this one 
Yeah, the majority of reviews here are very positive and almost everyone is saying it's their best release since 'Dream Police'. But c'mon people, let's be honest -- I have as much warm-hearted retro memories for the '70's as anyone else, but this album blows the roof off of everything Cheap Trick has done EVER !! Of course, their first five albums are classics, and they've had good ones since ('One on One', 'Woke Up With a Monster', 'CT '97' and 'Special One' - all fine albums), but this disc is truly a power-pop masterpiece...and I do not use that term lightly. However, it's fully deserved here. Robin's voice has never sounded as powerful in the studio as it does here...and this is a man who truly SHINES on every CT album (even the weak ones). Rick's guitar playing and songwriting here bring out every Beatles, ELO and Raspberries hook he ever learned, and at least three tracks -- "Welcome to the World", "Dream the Night Away" and "This Time You Got It" -- are stone-cold classics. This baby just rocks from start-to-finish and the production is the clearest I've ever heard on a CD. Tom's bass, in particular, rumbles so loudly that I had to change my CD car stereo tone setting from 'Rock' to 'Manual' because I thought the speakers were going to blow out !! Who would've thunk it...perhaps the best power-pop band ever puts out their ultimate album over 30 years since their inception. 'Rockford', I believe, will be the rock album to beat for the second half of this decade. 
Man, I was afraid nobody had the guts and skills to make this kind of music anymore...and ain't that a shame? But along comes the boys from ROCKFORD to put me right again. How to describe this album? Words like "WHOOSH!" and "ROAR!" and "CRUNCHY!" and "YEAH, BABY!" and "EXTRA-CRISPY!" come to mind as I try to absorb this melodic-but-crackling platter. Cheap Trick has been around long enough to make awesome and awful records, and maybe they've done both, though--thank goodness--a whole lot more of the former than the latter. For the most part of their career they have existed at the intersection of Beatlesque power pop, spitfire speed punk, and monster metal riffs. Heavily influenced by British 60s geniuses The Move, Cheap Trick have made a career out of memorable melodies, high volume shout-alongs, and wistful psychadelic reveries. Let me cut to the chase: this is my favorite Cheap Trick album since DREAM POLICE and it even rivals that recording. If you enjoy classic CT songs like "Hello There," "Surrender," "I Want You to Want Me," "Dream Police," "Clock Strikes Ten," "Voices," or "Stop This Game," you're gonna love this CD. But this is no sentimental journey into some ancient past dusty musty museum of memories...it's a fresh, rawkin' take on a classic heritage. It's about time these guys get recognized as one of the great American bands, period. My favorite cuts here include: "This Time You Got It," (a faster "Brontosaurus") "Welcome to the World," "Perfect Stranger," "Give it Away" (Aerosmith on speed), "O Claire" (more Beatly than the Beatles), and the sweaty "One More" (an impossible amagalm of the Move/ELO with some funky Prince workouts). Sonically, the sound is huge, clean, crisp...but never sterile. Seriously, be careful...you could blow your eardrums out on this one and still have a huge grin on your face 
I'm not the biggest Neil Young fan but I do like alot of his electric music as opposed to his acoustic stuff. Since I don't have alot of N.Y. music in my collection, I bought this and I'm very happy with it. Recommended to those who are like me in this regard 
Let me start by saying that Neil Young owes me nothing.I consider myself a true fan because I`m willing to take the good with the bad and it has made for some serious head scratching at times but now we have the first installment from the archives with songs from the imfamous Fillmore East shows from 1970.6 songs and 47 or so minutes later I still can`t understand why he never released this before now. Each song is played with an abandon and glee that underscores just how good the original Horse was - Danny Whitten,Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot are Crazy Horse...remnants of the L.A band the Rockets and they were the ultimate garage band and for Neils` music and the direction he was heading,they were the perfect choice. For this particular tour Neil added Jack Nitzsche on electric piano giving all the material just the right shades of color and helped round out the bands admittedly rough edges.Danny was instrumental in pushing Neil beyond his capabilities with his sympathetic guitar playing and outstanding vocals....remember that these guys started out as a vocal group before they even knew how to play their intstruments. Definitive versions of Down By the River and a vicious reading of Cowgirl in the Sand are the conerstones of the disc,Winterlong,Wonderin,Everybody Knows and then there is Dannys` Come on Baby Lets Go Downtown - a song about heroin - round out the disc. Incredible music and an essential artifact from a band that is no more,Neil Young has once again proved that in order to stay in the game you have to hold back and in this case I guess he was right.Rock and Roll never sounded better. 
If you can't run with this CD, you just don't like Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Long drawn out sets of gritty garage band grunge rock. My only problem with this CD is that there are only six songs. Not going to say it's better then Weld but that's just because of the song count. I love this CD and generally speaking I don't like live CD's. Prefer studio. Buy it if you are a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan. Period 
I have been looking forward to this CD, since I heard rumors of the release of Neil's archives probably a decade ago. I was very excited a few months ago when I heard that Neil will release the material, one CD at a time. As soon as I found this one in a store, I picked it up immediately. And I have listened to it a half dozen times already. It is fantastic: the driving guitar sounds of Crazy Horse, the magic of the original performance, the excitement of hearing some of Neil's classic songs early in his career. I have read a few of the reviews of "fans." I don't understand--and being OCD I should--how grown people can speak of being "ripped off" or "disappointed," because this CD does not have all of the songs of the original set at the Fillmore East. They complain because of one song not being on the CD. In the first place, this is Neil's artisitic material. And in the second place, being a "fan," I trust and respect his decision regarding how he wants to release it. His musical skill, his artistic creativity, his perfectionism make me interested in his music. The only promise Neil has to worry about is one that he obviously made to himself long ago, regarding the way he creates and releases "his" material without someone spoiling it when so-called experts mix it or put it together. I don't know a lot about Rock 'N Roll history, but I once read that Buffalo Springfield's first recording suffered because of those very issues. I love the album in spite of everything I have read, and I hope that some of the archival material has some early studio and live things by Neil's first band. I own everything Neil ever recorded on vinyl, cassette, or CD, most things in all three formats. I purchased everything in his catalogue a second time on CD, except for two albums not yet available. I never felt "ripped off." NOT EVER. This CD is no exception. You hear the early sounds of Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten, something I was ecstatic about getting and 46 minutes is plenty of material for me, although I would like to hear more. I figure it this way. I bought it. I enjoy it. I hope Neil will continue to release his material. If I had to encounter the constant negativity from a minority of people who never will be satisfied with anything, I would not release a note for them. Thank goodness Neil's music is about art and not about making a buck. That's why people have so much passion for it 
I tend to fall on both sides of the fence with this cd. I have the electric portion on boot and the sound isn't half bad and Cinnamon Girl sounds fine. I feel cheated that Young didn't put out the entire acoustic/electric set. The Dead have been doing wonders with board tapes for years, and I just think that Youngs hyper-perfectionism gets in the way sometimes (okay, all the time). He needs to loosen up. That said, I bought the new cd and have to say that the sound is pretty amazing, and it certainly trumps the boot in every conceivable way soundwise. But. A few notches down in sound in order to get a full show would've been a sacrifice worth making. But they are his tapes. If you have/don't have the boot, this is worth buying on quality alone and the performance is stellar. One more thing. Listen to this until the very end. The set ends, theres the requsite calls for more and then, over the house p.a., comes the sound of...James Taylor? God bless the old Fillmore crew and their warped sense of fun 
Finally, a recording that does justice to the awesome rhythm section of Molina and Talbot and Whitten's uncanny sense for fills, frills and punctuation. Much better,in many ways, than anything captured in the studio by this band, it is absolutely clear,like never before, why Neil loved to play with these guys--especially when he felt like cutting loose some of his unique psychotic guitar----It took a band as heavy as Crazy Horse to keep Neil's feet on the ground---or,at least, provide him with a place to land. Splendid indeed!!!! 
Any review of this CD should be of "what it is", instead of "what it could be". And, "what it is" is phenomenal. There are delightful versions of "Wonderin'" and "Winterlong" that I was hungry to hear and was not disappointed. Wonderin' appears on the album "Everbody's Rockin'", a disappointing NY effort, however this live version does the song justice and is a great example of early Crazy Horse. Winterlong was on "Decade", but, as in the case of Wonderin', I believe the live version is better. There was also negative talk during the days before the CD's release about "C'mon Baby Let's Go Downtown", most saying it would be the same version as on "Tonight's the Night". Young silenced the naysayers by placing a slightly different version on "Fillmore" (most people forget that the 1970 concert was for 2 engagements, so there were 2 versions to choose from) "Everybody Knows this is Nowhere" is a steady Crazy Horse entry, no complaints here, and others have dissected "Cowgirl in the Sand" and "Down by the River", and I have nothing to add. Conclusion: quit fussing over the songs Neil left out, and enjoy the songs he included. You really didn't think he would shoot the works in the first NYA release, did ya? Innaresting 
As one of the most rabid Neil Young fans alive, I cannot for the life of me understand what all the fuss is about regarding the absence of the first half of this set. There are countless other opportunities to purchase phenomenal recordings of Neil's live solo acoustic work that could not possibly have been outdone by the inclusion of the same songs here. Albums such as "Four Way Street," "Live Rust" and, most recently, the "Heart of Gold" DVD as well as the DVD accompaniment to "Greendale" on which Neil performs each song from that album in a sizzling, stripped-down form live in Dublin, are excellent samples of Neil as a live acoustic performer. Why it is so utterly necessary to hear Neil sing "I Am A Child" or "The Loner" on yet another live album is completely beyond me. The point here is that this legendary show was one of Neil's final performances with the brilliant Danny Whitten, Crazy Horse's original lead guitarist, just a year before Whitten died of an overdose--a death that plunged Neil into an oblivion of drunken regret and self-loathing that produced what is widely considered his masterpiece: "Tonight's the Night." Whitten wasn't in the band to strum an acoustic guitar as Neil crooned on about an Old Laughing Lady; he was there to electrify some of Crazy Horse's most enduring anthems--Down by the River and Cowgirl in particular--and he exceeds that expectation throughout this set. But the boundless treasure contained in merely six tracks here includes a gorgeous rendition of Neil's tune "Wonderin'," a song originally intended for a very early Crazy Horse album that didn't see the light of day until Neil's unlistenable 1983 Rockabilly rant, "Everybody's Rockin." The most moving moment on the CD--and one worth the price of the album alone--is to hear Neil introduce "Danny Whitten on guitar" before the band explodes into a riotous take on Danny's "Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown" with Whitten on lead vocal. The sound is unbelievable throughout the album, and these are easily the finest verions of these songs I have ever heard (and I've heard all of them). At just six tracks, "Live at the Fillmore East" is nonetheless an embarrassment of riches that is worth every penny and moment spent, as I did, parked in a strip-mall parking lot with the seat back, the stereo blasting out the open windows, and my entire face curling into a grin of absolute and invincible joy. 
It is one track and somewhat repetitive, but it's perfect for background music while handing out candy. Wind, owls, witch/monster voices...not bad. Understated. If you'd rather not have sci-fi/alien sounds in the background of your gothic-themed home, this is perfect. Production value is high and it's less than $10 
After reading her excellent Halloween book, I figured her Halloween CD would be worth owning. I always search for "different" Halloween CDs, but this was filled with the same old stuff. Chains, moans, and spooky laughs... then more chains, moans and spooky laughs. Very dissapointing 
This one definitely fights off the cheese! The sounds are believable, spooky, and well-produced. Additionally, the one-long-track format is perfect for looping during Trick-or-Treat or an outdoor haunt. While some may find the repetetiveness of the various sounds detrimental, I thought it worked fine! This is because it allows you to pack the punch of an assortment of sounds over short periods of time, without the pressure of having to cater to a specific timeline or story that short-term visitors won't be able to appreciate. Hallowe'en makes us totally subject to en masse memory rushes, and so it's probably a good thing that this mix is dense 
In keeping with Cuban tradition, my family likes to have a very spooky halloween on october 31. We didn't know how to make it very spooky, so we borrowed this cd from a friend who doesn't like halloween. We played it at our halloween party and everyone was so SCARED. It was as though we were in a real haunted house with ghosts and spooky things. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a VERY spooky halloween 
Berkner manages to deliver a CD that I like to listen to even when my son isn't in the car with me. The music is a mix of styles and tempos and there's not a dud in the bunch 
My 4 year old daughter loves all of the Laurie Berkner CDs. Laurie is the most frequently requested musician when we're in the car, and we sing her songs all the time. My husband isn't a huge fan (although he definitely prefers this over the Wiggles!) but I enjoy the songs and haven't been pushed to the point of annoyance as with many other children's CDs. The songs are great. The older songs are performed with originality, and the new songs are a lot of fun. I highly recommend any/all of the Laurie Berkner CDs. 
My Grandson Luke loves everything done by Laurie Berkner and so do I 
I bought this for my almost 2 year old daughter to listen to in the car. She loves the "elephant" song and enjoys the entire cd. Saturday we brought my 5 year old niece with us. She loved the cd and sang along with most of it. The best part is I don't mind, even kind of enjoy, listening to it 
This is a wonderful CD and one that you yourself find singing to. We love most of the songs and my children are learning all the words to the catchy little tunes. Would highly recommend it. It also helps that we have taken a music class that used a lot of the songs, therefore they are familiar to us 
Laurie Berkner puts out a sound that is like a lot of other kids musicians -- fun, lively, upbeat, simple music, etc. But there is a richness in these works that is quite infectious, and I can't place my finger on exactly what it is that elevates her beyond a lot of the other CDs we have in rotation. But the proof is in the pudding -- our 2 1/2 year old LOVES the music, its interactivity, its silly noises and its fun sing-along style. And as parents, it's not just "tolerable" on those long rides -- it's fun for us, too, to sing along and join in the fun 
What's not to like about Laurie Berkner. The reviewers were all right - she is fun, fresh, zany, energetic, and her music will have everyone singing along, including the adults. The music is definitely geared toward the Sesame Street crowd (I wouldn't buy this CD for anyone over 4). It has simple repetitive lyrics, a jaunty beat, basic folk guitar arrangements, and some easy-to-recognize cover songs. Why just 4 stars? My older son is 4 now and he and I can listen to this CD in the car once, maybe twice, but then we're through. Pleasant voice, nice energy, but maybe somewhat lacking in variety and depth. I'm sorry fellow reviewers - I know you all love her! Laurie IS great but if your kids are 3+ and you're ready for something more sophisticated but just as fun, check out SteveSongs. He has a cool rock vibe and great, smart lyrics that you will love as much as your kids do. Amazon sometimes has his used CDs, ("Marvelous Day" is the newest and best!!!) or you can google Stevesongs and follow the links 
My 18 month old can't get enough of Laurie! I'd like to say that this one is her favorite but she really adores all of them just the same...Just buy all of her CDs you'll become a 'groupie' too! 
My two yr old twins love Laurie from watching her on Noggin.. and when we get in the car to go anywhere the want to listen to Laurie.. they are even starting to sing along with the music. She is very entertaining, and easy to listen to for the adult with the kids. We have all her music cds and recommend them all. 
Fantastic! Both of my kids, as well as my husband and myself, love this CD 
i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa 
I originally bought this album in 1979, having no idea what I was getting into. The first time I listened I was absolutely amazed at Billy Cobham's drumming. I've watched the band member's careers, and as the years go by I've bought several CD's by Tom Scott(who did a stint with the Blues Brothers)and then the L.A. Express, Billy Cobham, who has become a drumming god and an icon in rock fusion, and Steve Kahn. This is a superior album, recorded live and beautifull. One that, having lost once, I will never be without again.The music is dynamic and rewarding, one minute soft and hypnotic, the next exploding with released tension. These players were masters-way back then! This was very different music from what disco America was into when it was released. I'm proud to say that I was listening to fusion when listening to fusion wasn't cool. If you can find this album, buy it! You will not be sorry. 
I recorded a snippet of "Shadows" when I was in Minneapolis in 1978 from their jazz radio station, but no one knew who it was, I played it for anyone who would listen, including the people at the station. I searched for a long time before someone copped that it was Tom Scott on sax, "but he doesn't have a live album". I went to a record store called "The Electric Fetus" and found "Alivemutherforya". There it was! It remains my favorite album to this day. My copy was stolen in 1982, but a sympathetic used record dealer called me when he found a promo copy of it and GAVE it to me! Now I can have it on CD, THANK YOU 
I saw this group on this tour, each promoting their own new album. They played "in the round" so we were very close and it was very intense. In fact Narada Michael Walden opened for them! Highlights here are Tom Scott's use of the electronic woodwind Lyricon, and Alphonso Johnson's island fusion Bahama Mama. This is not the usual all-star tour ego trip ... these guys play as a unit and support each other as a band. Having a recording of this unique gathering was a great bonus to owning all of their individual albums 
Billy Cobham, Alfonso Johnson, Tom Scott, Steve Khan (and a young Mark Soskin on piano) - really, what more be said. These four artists all qualify as board members of the founding fathers of electric jazz. Together they meld seamlessly as though this band had been a long term project and not the "one time only" act it was. I own it on vinyl and the only slight downside was the live mix. All these players have gone on to grow artistically and produce brilliant works, arguably more profound then what's on this album - but the magic lies in the mix of wonderful creative responses to each other, a rare and spontaneous spark that was thankfully captured on tape. How many times have you been to a live performance and walked away saying, "Man, I wish I had a tape recorder for that one!" Well, think of this as a chance to go back in time and get that recording of a world class group, totally jamming it out, right during the time in musical history when fusion reigned king - and these warriors were riding at the head of the battalion 
I'd been looking for this album on CD for years now (it was hard to find)-- it was an old favorite of mine from the 70's. It's got a group of extremely talented individual musicians. Together they created some really special stuff. It's a top-level version of that sort of jazz-rock, fusion stuff... they really cooked. I highly recommend it if you like this genre 
"When I close my eyes I Dream of You..." Ethereal guitar and smooth sways of sound make this a relaxing escape. "Stop" will be recognized by Madonna fans and Lizz Wright's version is much more slow and sultry. "I'm confessing that I love you..." Lizz Wright's music display's a warm heart contemplating dreamy thoughts we can all relate to as her voice reaches out into possibility. Her voice adds subtle dimensions of beauty to any song she takes on (Neil Young's Old Man) and as the mood slows down, a sultry connection between memory and future dreams evolves. Lizz Wright's Dreaming Wide Awake is a very pleasant surprise in its poignant honesty and this album is filled with endearing lyrics and soul soothing comfort. Her voice is truly exquisite and is well suited to dreamy moods and romantic longings. ~The Rebecca Revie 
Lizz Wright has a new fan--ME! Wright is the perfect blend of my favorite artists. I thought it was impossible to have the best of Me'Shell N'degeOcello, Cassandra Wilson, Tracy Chapman in one voice. But DAMN! Wright is original in her flow and even-tempered in her presentation. Her lyrics make everything in me move and when I listen to her, I cannot stop writing, I cannot stop crying for the real places her work lands in my spirit, in my life space. Poetic silk. This CD is a must-have if you enjoy any of the artists I mentioned, if you enjoy k d lang, Nat "King" Cole, silk and spice, smooth as the sun dips into the ocean at night. I can't wait to get her other releases. Go on, Sister Lizz. You doin' it right! 
Every song touches the heart and moves the soul 
The first review that appears by "Moved by Music" is right on the money with respect to the sound comparison between this, Lizz's second disc Norah Jones' first. I was hesitant to make such a comparison because I truly feel that on a pure jazz vocalist level, Lizz blows Norah away. Also I did not like the comparisons between SALT COME AWAY WITH ME because SALT was more of a jazz oriented creation while CAWM was definitely more smooth jazz/pop oriented. A few track on this disc have that same country music "twang" of the guitars that CAWM had which lent a different feel to the album as a whole (at least for me). The songs that really connected with me are those when her vocal prowess on on full display without a lot of musical instrumentation to hide her voice. Those songs that truly stand out to me are: A TASTE OF HONEY - wow, what a lead off single which features a beautiful simplistic vocal accompanied by the gently strumming bass guitar STOP - hauntingly beautiful lyrics moody musical production TROUBLE - one of the few reasonable upbeat tunes DREAMING WIDE AWAKE - beautiful love song CHASING STRANGE - really beautiful, spare ballad Equally enjoyable are: I'M CONFESSIN', WITHOUT YOU WAKE UP LITTLE SPARROW Honestly, I did not find this disc to be as cohesively enjoyable as SALT but it's not the overall failure that some have deemed it. Lizz is an artist with a beautiful voice so it's hard for me to hate anything she sings - it's just that this disc has more songs that aren't as moodily jazzy as those presented on SALT to me it's a good thing for any artist to grow and experiment with a new sound. Overall I'm glad that I bought this disc as I enjoy most of the songs can't wait to see Lizz perform live. 
I'm stunned. Speechless. Just when you think, "what's new in the world," LIZZ! I could go on forever and ever 
I purchased this CD on the basis of a recommendation from a friend. I honestly didn't believe Lizz could live up to the glowing recommendation, so man was I surprised. This lady has one hell of a voice and she knows how to use it. This CD grabs you right from the get-go with an incredible version of a Taste of Honey. Then a little later I was knocked on my butt by Hit the Ground. This was followed by two great covers - I'm Confessin' and Old Man. In both songs she sort of gets into them and wraps them around her and the result was both musical and insightful. This is one really fine CD 
This was a marvelous find. Lizz is wonderful with her soultry voice and her writing talents.She,s the female Barry White of our time.Great album 
It is so nice to hear a young woman with such stellar talent choose to make great music instead of great amounts of money,which she could easily do.I hear so little contemporary pop/soul/r/whatever,that I actually feel will last until next year when they're replaced by the latest big deal.This woman has all the abilities to still be around,when some of us older folks are long gone 
I saw her in concert and the next night I drove to another state to see her again. Wow, she does sound better than her recordings. Her voice is so sweet it brought tears to my eyes. Genre? I love jazz, folk, blues... Hey, its roots. She's beautifully and purely Lizz. I can't wait till she gets back to the states. You can't hold a moon beam in your hand 
Now, I'm not saying that Lizz Wright will take Anita Baker's place or anything; after all, Anita's 2004 album My Everything was damn good. I'm fairly new to Ms. Wright, but I came across her sophomore album Dreaming Wide Awake, and I must say it's aptly titled because usually one only dreams for an album to be THIS good. Picking a favorite song off this album is no easy task, but I think I'll have to go with "Chasing Strange". But other great songs include the sensual "Hit the Ground" and also "Without You", which was penned by Norah Jones' guitarist (and also good artist in his own right) Jesse Harris. Lizz also does well with remakes, like Ella Jenkins' "Wake Up, Little Sparrow". She even gives good R makeovers to rock classics, like Neil Young's "Old Man" and the Youngbloods' "Get Together". If you're one of those people that don't think altos are true singers, it's probably time to open up your mind. All in all, though, is Dreaming Wide Awake worth picking up? Damn Wright.

Thoroughly Modern Millie is a corny little movie filled with bloated egos...a classic and very soulful singer Miss Ann Dee (Angela DeSpirito) sold her legendary San Francisco "Ann Dee's 440 Club" a famed night club where Ann developed and showcased numerous big name talent such as Lenny Bruce, Ernestine Anderson, Johnny Mathis and many others to come to LA to embark on a solo singing career and by this time Ann Dee was already well into her forties..."Free Again" is a timeless classic Capitol Records lp filled with thrilling performances including the definitive version of "If He Walked Into My Life" from the musical "Mame" and the brilliant and hauntingly gorgeous medley "Carnival/This Dream" which is high vocal art at its very finest! "Free Again" was produced by avant-garde producer David Axelrod and beautifully arranged by the legendary Ernie Freeman...Ann Dee was so incredible in concert performing these wonderous classics with such passion and tremendous vocal beauty that she received numerous standing ovations every night over the years in always packed-out clubs (was the wildly successful "house singer" at the Beverly Hills "Ye Little Club" for many years) where one could find a wide array of the famous such as Judy Garland, Timi Yuro, Carmen McRae, Johnny Ray, Margaret Whiting, Dorothy Collins, Yvonne De Carlo, Gordon MacRae, Alexis Smith, Joanie Sommers, Regis Philbin to name just a few in her adoring audience...hopefully this lost vocal masterpiece will someday be released on Compact Disc if Capitol Records ever wakes up and realizes what a glorious treasure they have in their vault deserving to be remastered and released! Ann Dee was next cast in this lame and superficial Hollywood Musical and was thrilled but soon found that she would be pushed into the background by the greedy "stars" of this movie who were threatened by her magnificent talent (especially vocal!) and didn't want to share the spotlight or residuals with her...this was why Ann Dee did not receive any billing for her glorious performance that is clearly the finest vocal on this otherwise tired soundtrack filled with cartoon like baffonish performances. Ann was deeply hurt by all of this and the real kicker is that Ann Dee received no billing at all on the original soundtrack lp for her sublime performance of "Rose Of Washington Square" and was listed only as "vocal blues singer"...for shame and this needs to be corrected!!!! May Ann Dee rest in peace and she is loved and missed by many...and the 5-Stars are all for you Angel as you earned every one of them!!! 
Thoroughly Modern Millie was one of my absolute favorite movies when it came out. I used to go to my college listening library and request they play the soundtrack while I was studying. When it showed on campus, I was always there to see it once again on the big screen. The music is absolutely wonderful. Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore AND Carol Channing all in one great musical. If this ever comes out on DVD, I'll be first in line to buy it! Any hopes, or has it been totally forgotten? I hope not 
And the movie is even better! It's a classic musical about a 1920s flapper. It's soooo cute and the music is great. The best song is "Jazz Baby" sung by Carol Channing. It's really upbeat and fun! See the movie if you ever get the chance 
The musical numbers on this soundtrack by Julie Andrews and Carol Channing are capricious fun. However don't overlook the contributions by Elmer Bernstein (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE, etc) and Andre Previn (ELMER GANTRY, THE FORTUNE COOKIE, etc). Bernstein won his sole Academy Award for his original music on this film. Andre Previn (with Joseph Gershenson) was also nominated for music adaptation but did not win. Don't't worry about Previn because he has won 4 Academy Awards so far! That being said this is still a thoroughly enjoyable album 
This is a great album. Written after her father died, Johnny Cash's presence is felt throughout the album, made obvious by the family sound clips that begin and end the album. The love she felt for her father is so clear and present in this album, it almost feels like you are intruding on her private moments. The songs "I Was Watching You" and "The World Unseen" are profound and moving ballads, and I find myself playing them at night. The sound quality in the album is a bit rough, like the roadhouse cast much of the music takes on. It really works with this music. The music does suffer a from heavy compression in places that is glaringly and unprofessionally obvious. Does every album really have to go to '11'? But the strength of the music conquers these problems. 
I lost my father almost a year ago, and this album, more than any other, sings to me in a kindred way. They are the words I want to say to my daddy that I cannot now say. They're the lyrics to my heart written by a total stranger whose emotions are straight up and dead on. I thank Rosanne Cash for this gift of music and love 
I've been waiting for Rosanne Cash to find her voice and break out with another stunning album since "The Wheel." I find great similarities between that album and this one: The thoughtfulness, the incredible soulfulness, and the intertwining of sorrow, passion, longing and questioning. Add to that a fiery edge on several of these tracks (such as you don't really find on the more meditative "The Wheel") and you have a stellar album. I have not listened to the entire album as of yet, but what I have heard has convinced me to make the purchase. This is by far the best music Ms. Cash has released in many years; in fact, in my opinion "Black Cadillac" outshines "The Wheel" and yes, possibly even "Interiors" as a coherent, thought-provoking and emotionally provocative album. As for it's dark content, recent losses in my own life cause Ms. Cash's songs to resonnate in my heart and soul with even more power. I needed this album at this time in my life. As well, it's great to see Ms. Cash at the top of her form once again 
Rosanne Cash's meditation of the loss of life and love (her father, Johnny; her stepmother, June Carter Cash; and her mother, Vivian Cash Distin) is her darkest album since the divorce chronicle of "Interiors." She calls into question both God and herself on such songs as "House on the Lake" and the title track. Like some of Emmylou Harris' best work (like the recent "Red Dirt Girl"), Rosanne has moved to the far fringe of country and given her music an both a dose of intelligence atmospheric edge. You won't find any lighthearted 'redneck girl' stompers here. In fact, "Radio Operator" is probably the closest thing to a generic country song on "Black Cadillac." This is a good thing. Cash refuses to bend to anyone's rules (much like she has on some of her other great records and "Rules Of Travel). She delivers both her grief and her resolve simply and elegantly on "Dreams are Not My Home" and gives a reality check face slap to bickering lawyers on "Like Fugitives" and a reaffirmation of life/faith on "God Is In The Roses." To say that "Black Cadillac" is merely a tribute to her lost family members is selling the CD short. Rosanne is, like the Dixie Chicks, Slaid Cleaves, Emmylou Harris or even her father's "American Music" series, making country music for thoughtful adults 
Since she gets virtually no radio-play in our area I always look forward to her new releases. This one was clearly in the making for some time and provides a reflection of things going on in her life; as well as issues in the world around us. A worthwhile addition to your collection 
Bad stuff: Rosanne's voice is not her dad's instrument. Nobody else had his particular gift of connection, either, so that's nothing of which to be ashamed. Also, this CD is on the gloomy side, commemorating the deaths of Rosanne's stepmother, father and mother as it does, and reflecting songs she wrote during and just after that two-year period. Good stuff: If such a thing is possible, this is a "good gloomy." Not happy, but artful and thoughtful. There are several tracks worth repeated listening, and all of the album deserves a careful hearing. If you stick it on and have a conversation over it, it will not impress you. But if you reserve an hour or so, and listen with earphones or at least with full attention and no distractions, you will be moved. Best stuff: Even better than Rosanne's lyrics, good as some of them are, is the band she asked to join her. A dozen musicians, not counting one female backup singer, participate in one track or another, and they sound wonderful. This is a well-produced, well-engineered slice of 21st-century singer-songwriter craftsmanship. Final word: Even if you love the entire Cash/Carter clan as I do, this is not a disc you will play often, but neither is it a product you should miss hearing. 
I had read good reviews about this, but was not certain if it was not just hype about the fact that Johnny was her dad and there was a movie about him. I bought the cd and I LOVE IT. She has written the most beautiful lyrics, this is a cd that has the most profound meaning... Buy it (As for the stupid sign below this asking why no voting buttons? I don't know babe, it's your machine, you (Amazon) do something about it 
no one can ever accuse ms cash of riding along on daddy's coatails. she has been a steady producer of very good albums as the years pass by...but with black cadillac rosanne has made her masterpiece! with the opening sound bite of dad playin with his daughter at a very young age, your journey is only beginning, in what will be rosanne pouring her feelings out and into her music.with the opening track "black cadillac" you know you are in for a very private confession and truths about her undying love for her dad..."i was watching you" for me the centerpiece of this album oozes thoughts and feelings that have very seldom been put out for all to hear as she transfixes her late mom now with the passing of her dad, powerful lyrics with hearfelt sentiment..."God is in the roses" is simply beautiful..in "world without sound" her name dropping lennon sent chills thru me..the songs is a rocker to the hilt...track number 12 entitled "the good intent" is named that, for what was the name of the original name for the boat that brought the first Cash to america, her research is astounding...the lp ends as it begins with her dad's voice...as it should......this by far is the best lp of 2006....listen to and marvel over it time and time agai 
She's mellow..she sounds like Dad and she's got it. It's a great album and a good one to initiate yourself to her music 
I really love this cd! the songs are good and great to dance to! 
Although this is a superb set, it is not quite as advertised: the first time all of Andy's Columbia chart singles have been rounded up in one collection. Over the years, Williams placed 45 entries of Billboard's Hot 100 charts on either the Cadence or Columbia labels. The first and ONLY time all 45 original recordings appeared in one collection was in 1995 -- in the 60-track, 3 CD box set "Andy Williams: His Greatest Hits Finest Performances" (Reader's Digest 102C). I should know -- as I compiled and produced it! Unfortunately the Digest box set is currently out of print. At least now, though, we have the present 50-track collection -- although it does omit Andy's pre-Columbia gems (among them, "Butterfly," his only chart-topping single). 
Andy began his recording career with the small Cadence label, better known for the early recordings of the Everly Brothers. He had some success on that label with songs such as Canadian sunset, Butterfly (his only UK number one hit) and Lonely Street. However, those songs and the others he recorded for Cadence are not here - you must look elsewhere for them. He left Cadence for Columbia in 1962 and that is where this compilation begins. This outstanding compilation contains all of Andy's American hits for Columbia, presented in chronological order. At the end of the second CD there are some bonus tracks. Andy's theme song (Moon River) is among these - his version of this song was never released as a single although it is now regarded as his song. The set includes all the popular classics that Andy is remembered in America for such as Dear heart, Days of wine and roses, Danny boy, Music to watch girls by, Happy heart and many others. What makes this collection particularly interesting is the inclusion of Andy's lesser hits, most of which are rarely heard these days, such as Charade, Wrong for each other, How can I tell her its over and One day of your life. Can't take my eyes off you (a UK number five hit) and It's so easy (a UK top twenty hit) are also among the bonus tracks. Brits and expatriate Brits will appreciate the inclusion of these two important tracks, which mean that all Andy's UK hits from 1962 (Stranger on the shore) to 1973 (Solitaire) except May each day (which just made the UK top twenty) are included. Andy's last three UK hits (Getting over you, You lay so easy on my mind, The other side of me) are omitted but none of them made the UK top thirty and they, like May each day, can be found elsewhere. Can't get used to losing you, Almost there (both number two), Can't help falling in love (number three), Where do I begin, Solitaire (both number four) and Home loving ma (number seven) were, together with Can't take my eyes off you, Andy's biggest UK hits. So this is a fascinating collection of Andy's best music, superbly re-mastered and with an informative booklet. Whether you are a committed fan or not, this is the best American compilation ever released of Andy's music. Indeed, it might be the best compilation of his music ever released anywhere in the world. So buy this, then (if you are interested) buy a collection of his Cadence hits 
Lest we forget, Andy Williams was a major force in American popular music for nearly two decades. From 1956 through 1974, he placed over 40 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart. Eight of these tunes made their way into the Top Ten. During those same years, Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well. He placed nearly 30 albums on the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more. I could never quite understand why his label for most of that time, Columbia Records, failed to issue a collection worthy of his stature and accomplishment in the business. Oh, there were two "Greatest Hits" albums issued, but both were done with very little care. Happy to say that Taragon Records has corrected this injustice. Here is a collection for Andy Williams fans to die for. In addition to a terrific remastering job, this two disc set features a 12 page booklet with some wonderful photographs. The package includes every chart hit Williams had during his nearly two decades at Columbia. I enjoyed them all. Aside from the well known hits such as "Can't Get Used To Losing You", "Dear Heart" and "(Where Do I Begin) Love Story" I would recommend to you "One Day of Your Life", "A Song For You" as well as a rather obscure 1965 hit "Ain't It True". I love that song and had not been able to find it anywhere for nearly 40 years. All in all, this 50 song collection is a bit pricey but given the poor quality alternatives out there I recommend that you pay the price for this one 
The music of Andy Williams, one of the most popular beautifully smooth-styled vocalists who managed to sustain his popularity through the early rock era, has had his catalog, particularly his Columbia recordings, reissued for years yet never in a truly comprehensive way til now. Taragon Records, the small independent label has done in superb fashion what Sony Music has avoided for the duration of the CD-era. Here in this 2-CD set appear all 29 Columbia A- and B-sides Williams saw rise through the pop charts in the 60s and 70s. While there have been countless compilations of Williams' Columbia tunes, for some reason many of his fairly major hits have been ignored up to now. Included here are "Hopeless", "Wrong For Each Other" and "Don't You Believe It", all top-40 singles not previously available on domestic Williams CDs. Beyond the pop-charting singles are his Adult Contemporary-charting singles, two U.K.-only hits, his Italian version of "Can't Get Used To Losing You" and "Moon River", ironically his "theme song" yet a tune that did not make it into the top 100 of the charts. With a total of 50 tracks with no fluff or filler and including a 12-page liner notes booklet with backround and track details, this piece is the ultimate collection of Williams' Columbia material. For the Williams fan, the best, bar none, piece to own. And interestingly, if you combine this with Varese Vintage's "25 All Time Hits - The Cadence Years", (which see) you have the complete collection of Williams' career pop-charting singles. Both are exceptionally desirable for the true and casual Williams fan 
With all the Andy Williams compilations available it's nice to finally have one definitive collection. This 2-CD, 50-track, remastered set gathers all Andy's Columbia charted singles (not to be nitpicky but Williams' "White Christmas" and "Do You Hear What I Hear" charted high on Billboard's Top Christmas Singles in 1963 and 1965 respectively, but are not included), many of which appear here for the first time in stereo, and several of which appear here for the first time on CD. The compilers thoughtfully included his biggest "hit", "Moon River", even though it was never released as a single in the US, and an Italian-language version of "Can't Get Used to Losing You". Highly recommended 
Ghostface makes a huge leap in this album. He finally manages to combines the story telling that won him critical acclaim with with the catchy hooks and beats that made the Wu-Tang famous. Not all the skits on the album work, but most of the tracks are good and a few of them are outstanding. Without a doubt one of my favorite hip hop albums of the year 
After two so so album, Ghostface brings back the sound he is famous for. This, Ironman, and Supreme Clientele are my favorite albums by him. Bulletproof Wallets and The Pretty Toney Album were good, but they were missing something, the former was missing good production, the latter was a little poppy and was missing the one thing that Ghost should of had, Raekwon. Put the two together, their unstoppable, but then that's what you suspect on either one of their albums, a storytelling song were they both go back and forth. This album has both great production (brought to us by Just Blaze, MF Doom, J-Dilla, Pete Rock and others) and great guests, Raekwon, plus a track with the whole Wu-Tang Clan. The most surprising track is the bonus track Three Bricks, which Ghost and Rae share mic time with The Notorious BIG, who is resurrected with a verse from his classic N****s Bleed, but it works here to a great effect. Favorites include Kilo featuring Raekwon, The Champ, 9 Milli Bros. featuring Wu Tang Clan, R.A.G.U. featuring Raekwon, Be Easy featuring Trife, Clipse Of Doom featuring Trife, Dogs Of War featuring Raekwon Theodore Unit, Momma featuring Megan Rochell, and Three Bricks featuring The Notorious B.I.G. Raekwon. Highly Highly Recommended 
Two years after his Def Jam debut Ghostface Killah is back again with his 5th solo album in "Fishscale." Spawnning the street single, "Be Easy" and the radio single, "Back Like That," Ghostface actually started to get more radio play because of the young up-and-comer Ne-Yo singing on the hook. Either way Ghostface was finally getting the exposer he deserved, but was his whole album gonna be filled with radio-friendly singles? I hope not. 1. The Return of Clyde Smith (Intro) - No Rating 2.

He still murders the beat with his flow as well, very very impressive. Ghost didn't sell out at all, this album is filled with bangers. Definitely check it out, hip hop at it's finest 
A stunning achievement, as deft and vivid as you'll likely hear all year, and as frightening, stimulating, fearsome, beautiful, dangerous as any graphic novel. In a time when `Gangsta' has watered itself down to a point where the cartoon minstrelsy of a 50 Cent or a Game flourish in the multi-platinum zone, Ghostface, one of the great Hip Hop lyricists of our time, squeaks toward gold. The beats are fresh and living, thanks most notably to the late J Dilla and Pete Rock, with borrowed stimulus from MF Doom, and the exposition incisive and dramatic - and soulful. Those who decry the brutality of some of the `novellas' are the same as those who worship "The Sopranos", shining a light on bigger race issues than they're likely to admit. If the hierarchy in Hip Hop is the late, great Biggie, then Ghostface is heir to the throne. This just might be the album of the year. My grade: 
This is easily one of the best albums of 06. The old Ghost returns....classic rhymes and stories. Production on this album is bangin. I think the best beat is Barbershop...too bad it's so short. 
Many old-school Wu fans will remember the late Dirt Dawg chanting "THE GHOSTFACE KILLAAAAAH - NO ONE CAN GET ILLAH!" on Da Mystery Of Chessboxin'. At the time, Ghostface wasn't one of the more noticable acts in the Wu, or most promising - guys like Meth, RZA, GZA, Raekwon, Deck, and ODB were the most recognizable voices on Enter The 36 Chambers, while Ghostface, U-God, and Masta Killa played second fiddle. Nothing really changed for a few years, and most people would respond to his name saying "oh, you mean that guy Ol' Dirty shouted out?" Then arguably the greatest hip-hop album of not only the nineties, but hip-hop's existence, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., dropped. Raekwon was obviously the star of the album, but Ghostface was a supporting character no one could forget. On 11 of 18 tracks, and getting just as much shine on each of them as his tag-team partner, Ghostface helped make OB4CL the classic album it was, in a role that no one else could've filled. After this, Ghostface was the number one most anticapted member of the Clan to drop the next solo album. Ironman dropped a decade ago, and it was classic. Although the sound was different to most Wu albums at the time(very heavy on soul samples), that allowed Ghost to show his signature style; a very emotional, high-pitched flow with razor-sharp lyrics, rapping over beautiful soul samples taken straight out of the '70s. Ghost clearly wasn't as hardcore as his Wu-brethren, but he didn't have to be; he was the soulful, wise, and at times confusing Ghostface Killah; and no one would have it differently. Fast forward 10 years, and to FishScale. In my wholehearted opinion, Supreme Clientele was the best album in Ghostface's discography - emphasis on was. I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of all Ghost albums(Ironman and Supreme Clientele were the only albums getting constant rotation from me before Fishscale was released, while Bulletproof Wallets and Pretty Toney just sat in the my disc collection collecting dust), but both Ironman and Supreme Clientele were undeniable classics from start to finish. The two decent, yet lackluster releases that followed had me somewhat split on Ghost's upcoming album, and not as hyped as some of my fellow Clan heads. Fishscale dropped, and on first listen, it didn't really strike me; I really had no clear opinion of it. It left me wondering if what I'd just listened to was some classic ish, or another release from Ghostface that falls into the 'meh' category - so I put it away for a month, and focused my attention on other albums. I went back to Fishscale one night, and gave it a second chance - and on the second listen, it had me instantly hooked. The production on this album is absolutely fantastic, and comes from some of my favorite beatsmiths in the game, including J Dilla(God rest his soul) and MF DOOM(obviously under the Metal Fingers alias), and Pete Rock. One thing I really admired were all the underground producers he recruited for this album, giving it a feel of alternative hip-hop, while also receiving the polished feel of a mainstream release. Ghostface himself is in top-form on this album; more so than on any other of his releases, to be perfectly honest. The variety in his subject matter is unprecedented in hip-hop today, as he goes from rapping about being a bad child, and getting whipped with a strap(Whip You With A Strap), then follows that up with a song dedicated to an ex-lover(Back Like That). Of course, as the title of the album would suggest, we get the Wu-coke affairs we all know and love, with stand-out tracks including "Kilo," "Three Bricks," and "R.A.G.U." My favorite cuts, though, would have to be the Wu-reunion track "9 Milli Bros.," and the absolutely hilarious "Underwater"(where Ghost meets an abusive Spongebob Squarepants who drives a Bentley while listening to the Isley Brothers - you read that sentence alone, and try not to laugh). Throughout this album, Ghostface drops dope track after dope track - there isn't a single track to skip on this album. Even the skits have some merit, or at least the ones that don't end so quickly that you hardly even notice them. This is my personal favorite album from Ghostface, and definitely one of, if not THE best album released this year. And while this may not have been the best year for Wu albums(Meth, U-God, and Inspectah Deck all dissapointed me, while Bronze Nazareth's critically acclaimed Great Migration did little to get my interest up for future ones), Ghostface did manage to drop an absolute classic. This was widely regarded as the most anticipated hip-hop release of 2006, and it not only lived up to the hype, but greatly exceeded it. Bottom line: BUY THIS ALBUM. It doesn't get much better than this 
Put down that D4L cd and pick this one up. Ghost has came back with a jaw buster. The production is superb and the lyrics are flawless. Nothing is a drawback on the album and no one will be dissapointed. Highly recommended rating A 
Wow, I am highly impressed with ghostface on this one. The beats are fantastic and his lyrics are beautifully decorated on pretty much every track. Great production and class lyric writing often results in a masterpeice. This is Ghostface at his best! 
Wow!!! "This aint your granddaddy music, nah this is hip hop" ---Method Man---(song "run 4 cover" on blackout) Even though this is not a method man cd I felt that quote was needed.This cd has a lot to offer.It touches on different topics...such as....Ghostface remembering his childhood trouble making and punishments on "Whip You With a Strap".One of my favorite cuts on this album is "Kilo" feat.Raekwon...The beat is awsome and both come with the lyrics.This should not be slept on....and if you can get this cd cheap(i.e. used)it would be a GREAT deal.Another great track is "Be Easy" a great eastcoast club song...beat laced by Pete Rock...I could go on for days..I think it would be easier if I listed my fav tracks(in no order) Shakey Dog Kilo The Champ 9 Milli Bros Beauty Jackson R.A.G.U. Whip You With a Strap Be Easy Underwater Three Bricks 
There's too much being said these days about how NY has fallen off, and many questions on who will reclaim the crown for NY. Ghostface Killah wasn't on a highly publicized "Take NY Back" mission when FishScale was released, but the album is all NY and even a GA boy like myself can appreciate the work that went into the album. I give this album 5 stars because I can really find no fault with it. This is easily the best Wu-Tang album in 5 years and without IronMan, this would be Ghost's best album. If you liked the flavor of the Pretty Toney album, FishScale's got the old-school flavor swirled with the new. It's a perfect follow up to Pretty Toney with some traces of the past, but with a forward momentum. The CD can be played straight through and doesn't lose momentum until about 3/5ths of the way through where it levels out from the excited NY Stand Up type beats to the more introspective songs. Ghost's lyricism is at its best on the CD with less word-play and more complete thoughts being laid out line for line. Though NY might not notice, this album is keeping NY rap afloat in these days where mainstream attention is focused on the South. Ghost is still holding it down in '06 with the best produced CD of the year and finally lyrics worthy of the beats. Like I said, I can't find any fault with the album--it's the complete meal. 5/5 
I prefer his former works indeed, but I think it's good album at the same time.Jaheim's vocal is excellent for R style, and every album displays a obvious continuation with the previous one. I can feel his strong faith of Ghetto, which is much better than those singers who are always clinging to sex theme... Yes, not as good as Ghetto Love,or Still Ghetto,but some tracks are listenable:The Chosen One, Every Time I Think About Her, Fiend, Like A DJ, I Ain't Never.. 
I don't know what everyone else is listening to, but I listed to this album and it put me to sleep. For real. There's nothing new here and everything sounds the same. In other words: "Ghetto Classics" is boring. There's not even one song on here that could be a "ghetto classic." 
Same theme and style all the way through almost monotone, nothing stood out on this one. I played once and it's sitting on the shelf 
Okay, I was unaware that Jaheim had a new cd out this year, as I'm not really a fan of R B music and don't keep up with the goin on's however; there are a few R B artist of today, that I will spend my money on, and Jaheim is one of them. I heard Ghetto Classics for the first time on Memorial Day last, and immediately, I was sprung. When I heard the first track "The Chosen One, I went crazy! The song starts out just like the late great hit maker Willie Hutch's classic "I Choose You" from the 70's movie soundtrack "The Mack". Ooh, that took me back... The track "125" is also a favorite of mine, as is "I Ain't Never". This young man's voice is truly incredible, and it takes me for the ride of my life each time I listen to him sing! I've seen him in concert twice when he was in L.A. performing at the Wiltern Universal. Y'all know, when an artist sounds hella good live, without the studio machines helping them along, then you know they can blow fo' real! Keep up the good work Jah 
Jaheim is back with his third album "Ghetto Classics". I'll admit, I downloaded his first album, Ghetto Love, but I just wasn't feeling it that much. It had way too many songs in my opinion (there was twenty-one tracks in all), and honestly I thought it was better than most R music coming out at the time, but I really didn't think it stood out neither. I've never checked out his second release "Still Ghetto", but I may do that soon. Even though I wasn't into his first album, this album, in my opinion, is great. It's short, sweet, and solid. Jaheim is not the typical club singer, and he's not constantly singing about sex as some artists may. I believe that Jaheim is a lot more talented than most R crooners today and his music is way more enjoyable to listen to. The album starts off with a convincing opener "The Chosen One". I love this track. The chorus is great, and it'll have most lovers singing along to it. "Everytime I Think About Her" is a track about a girl who does some wrong things, like clubhopping, but he just can't let her go for it. Jadakiss is featured, and he drops a nice two verses. The next track is definitely a keeper. "Daddy Thing" is a great track about taking care of a girl and her baby while her man was in prison. However, when he gets out, she doesn't need Jaheim anymore, right? "Forgetful" is a decent track about how he gave his girl everything she wanted but she still wants to complain about things. This is an ok cut. The next cut is one of my favorites. "Like A DJ" has a great beat for the song. Jaheim uses DJing metaphors to explain that the woman he likes seems to be all over every guy but him. I love the chorus ("You fade me out, and you blend him in, I can't get no spin unless I'm requested, she's something like a DJ!") "Fiend" is a laidback type of track featuring Styles P. "I Ain't Never" is a beautiful song about finally finding love. This has a great chorus and a great beat to back up great singing. "125th" isn't my favorite track, but it's a good track in it's own right. "Masterpiece" is a nice cut, talking about a female named "Tracey Donatello" who Jaheim meets. "Conversation" and "Come Over" end the album off on a perfect tip. So I'd suggest anyone who is a Jaheim fan or a general R fan to pick this up. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Jaheim pretty much comes correct on all thirteen tracks. My personal favorites are The Chosen One, Like A DJ, Come Over, Daddy Thing, I Ain't Never, and Everytime I Think About Her. However, all tracks are good. I will definitely check out "Still Ghetto", and I look forward to all future releases by Jaheim. 
Tis new Jaheim album is solid. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it's close. Unfortunately there was poor promotion of the album and it didn't sell like his previous two. This often happens when an album is released after the lead single has fizzled off the radio. I can't wait for the next one! and this one is defenitely worth the money 
I can see by the abundance of good reviews that the formula of using template beats is alive and well. Any one of us could have made this album. Just go to a neighborhood teenager with a drum machine pay him $100 to purchase 11 minutely variant beats and you have this album. This album has absolutely no originality. We have heard this album many times before and I'm sure we will hear it many times in the future. I give it two stars for the fact that it does make for adequate generic r background music for a lite dinner party 
I too received this fantastic CD as a Word Perfect 6.0 Demo back in 1993. It always frustrated me that my home CD player wouldn't recognize the CD since the 1st track was actually a data track. I did a search on Amazon to see if there was another release, after several unsucessful attempts to load the demo version into my iPod. Not only did I find this CD with two additional tracks but also discovered a DVD of a live performance of Innovators. Viewing this concert is also an incredible experience. Read the liner notes for each song and it will bring great meaning to the songs and to the whole CD. What an incredible listening experience even today, 12 years later 
I too got this CD as a Word Perfect promo thing back in 1993. I don't even recall trying the software, and found the music tracks "odd". I was but 21 then, and music - to me - had words and regular, rhythmic drum beats - this wasn't music! Two years ago, after being thru a lot of turmoil from '94 to '01, I stumble on this CD - I still had it after all those years. Now I keep it in the truck and in the carousel at home and nothing compares to turning this up loud enough to drown everything else out. And it saves the expense at the therapists office :) Not only did it provide me with a new understanding of music, it helps me live a much more relaxed life 
The music and the insert could each stand on their own as powerfully moving pieces. Together they open the heart and mind to new understandings. At once transcendental and grounding, Innovators can be merely a lovely musical encounter or a growth experience. Either way, you'll want to listen again and again 
This outstanding album is something really worth listening to! I first listened to it because of a friend of mine, and my life changed the moment I listened to "Man Among Man"! Indescribable! These two wonderful musicians know secrets that when listened can really touch you deeply. Here's a MUST HAVE! No doubts there 
This is a great live cd! I did not know about My Morning Jacket. I read some reviews of this cd where the theme has been, for the world of live cds, that this is a superior work. The live versions of the songs have been described by reviewers as vastly superior and different from the studio versions. Being a big music fan, I bought this having no familiarity with the band. I really do like it. My Morning Jacket is definitely a different type of band. This is no funky, good time type of group. The songs are majestic and very arty. They sound like a cross between Coldplay, U2, Supertramp, Roadiohead and folky Bruce Springsteen. The singer wails like a banshee and is the heart of the sound. Guitars are used to punctuate rather than carry the whole melody. They are described as having a Southern Rock vibe but I do not hear that influence. The music always is very dramatic. The thing that impresses me the most is the beautiful arrangements of these songs, especially how the instruments are used. There is nothing virtuoistic about the musicians yet every note seems like it was the perfect note played. They fit wonderfully within the context of the songs I wonder if the sound was enhanced after it was recorded? If there are no overdubs then their live sound is truly incredible. The songs I like the best (remember I knew nothing about them) are; "Off the Record" This is a reggae type song that utilizes a Hawaii Five O riff then morphs into the best instrumental jam session on the cd "Wordless Chorus" this song best demonstrates the singer's vocals "Gideon" a cool, dramatic song. "One big holiday" this song closest resembles conventional song structure. It is a song that builds into a crescendo all the time using a cliched, common guitar riff as a theme. "X-mas curtain" I do not know what this is about b/c you can rarely understand the lyrics but it sounds like a beautiful song of elation I was not impressed with this at first listen probably b/c the songs are complicated and challenging. After repeated listeings I recognized the serious depth. All of the songs have energy but what makes them real special is that there is a genuine beauty contained within them. I am converted and will see them if they play live in my town. This lives up to it's reputation as a great live album 
Simply perfect. Immediately catapulted into my personal top five live albums of all time, alongside Police Live!, The Name of This Band is Talking Heads, Widespread Panic's Light Fuse Get Away, and Wilco's Fighting Television 
This fantastic album is also available as a 4 LP box set. I know it is limited edition, and the label's website is sold out, but record stores are supposed to have it around Halloween. It has an album side of bonus tracks and the packaging and sound quality are super nice. 
My Morning Jacket is an incredible band. I knew I could always count on them to release a solid psychedelic, southern rock record. But when "Z" came out in 2005, I was absolutely speechless; there was finally a band in the United States to compete with Radiohead, and incidentally, "Z" is probably the best album released since "Ok Computer." It took the band to a whole new level. They went from being solid to superstars; from doing obscure music magazine interviews to releasing a concert in indie theaters across the country. The next logical step was to do what their southern rock forebarrers of the 70's did. Do a double live album. "Okonokos" is the album and not only does it compare with Little Feat's "Waiting for Columbus," Allman Brother's "Live at Fillmore East," and Cream's 2nd disc on "Wheels of Fire," it actually manages to best them all. The sound may not be revolutionarily different from the mood of "Z," but that actually plays to My Morning Jacket's advantage; why change perfection? The album is a little more gritty and has a few warts, but songs like "At Dawn," "Golden," and "It Beats For You" find their definitive version in live format. Elsewhere, the off-key singing on "Off the Record" is a bit tough to take (especially since it's one of "Z's" strongest songs) but you can't be a revoutionary all the time. Another tiff is with the choice of set list. With 21 songs of space, the pallate was wide open with possibility, and we get almost half the album dedicated to a record MMJ fans haven't put down for a year. More music from "At Dawn," the many EP's and independant releases, and particularly the near-perfect "It Still Moves" would have been nice. To be honest, though, these are minor, picky problems in comparison to the joyous, reverb-soaked 2 hours of music fans are rewarded with. I can't wait for the next studio album. Overall: 9 out of 10 
My Morning Jacket has steadily been climbing the commercial and critical recongition in the last 6 years, with 2005's "Z" album ranking easily as one of the best albums of last year. MMJ has built its reputation as a tireless live act, and finally MMJ releases a live album, and what a joy it is. "Okonokos" (2CDs, 21 tracks, 123 min.) brings the full force of what it's like to experience My Morning Jacket in concert. As can be expected, the live set is heavy on "Z" songs: 8 of its 10 tracks are on here, mostly on CD1, with such gems as "Off the Record", which takes the studio track to new highs in a live setting, and "It Beats 4 U", with its underlying heavy drums. CD2 will bring higher delights to long-time MMJ fans, with epic (10+ min.) pieces like "Dondante" and "Run Through", but also bringing older tracks like "At Dawn" and "Xmas Curtain". The set closes with "Dancefloors" and an exuberant "Magheetah", several tracks on here from the equally excellent 2003 album "It Still Moves". If you haven't seen My Morning Jacket yet, do yourself a favor and go do so, you won't be disappointed. (MMJ is about to start a Fall tour in support of "Okonokos".) I have seen them a number of times live, but none was better than the now-legendary set they brought at this year's Bonnaroo Festival, starting at midnight and going full blast for 3 straight hours. I must admit that I left after about 2 1/2 hours, I was just spent! That said, "Okonokos" is by far the best live album released this year. Essential, period 
The whole idea of a live album can be a bit tricky for all bands, especially for a great band like the Kentucky boys of My Morning Jacket. Let's face it - out of all the groundbreaking artists of the past 40 years who've cut a live one, about 90 percent of them seem to be sub-par. And no, the live downloaded Phish and .moe bootlegs that you listened to in your college dorm while sucking on a glass Jerome Baker piece don't count. Sure, the concerts at which they were recorded must've been enjoyable for the fans, but it can be very taxing when attempting to capture the essence of what it's like being there as a concertgoer in that exact moment. A double-disc album, Okonokos was recorded last November during a two-night stint at The Fillmore in San Francisco, while touring in support of their latest release Z, which was on many critics' year-end top ten lists. Okonokos exhibits the majestic semblance of MMJ's live shows and proves that they are not a jam band but instead a band that just knows how to jam. Disc one's opening salvo, the bubbly "Wordless Chorus," warms up the album with front man Jim James' falsetto-laden "ahhhs" and "whooos," then segues into the creaking "It Beats 4 U." The first two tracks sort of taxi the runway for the disc, but it is with the epic "Gideon" that it truly takes off and sounds like James is singing all alone at the peak of a mountain in a deserted land, trying to establish contact when he hits that high note. Any listener who has had the privilege of witnessing a live MMJ show knows that "One Big Holiday" is among their most empowering live numbers and tells the seasoned music aficionado that My Morning Jacket was made for the era of vinyl, when the dual onslaught of guitars from James and guitarist Carl Broemel hits the listener's ears. Also on the set list is the early Elton John-ish "What a Wonderful Man" with a tad of a baroque tone and "Off the Record," which begins with some rock-steady dub funk before gliding into some ambient martini lounge space pop. Drummer Patrick Hallahan makes his presence felt when "Lay Low" comes around with his thudding and reverberating bass drum tremors before the extended electric guitar overdrive is throttled. Whereas the first disc showcases MMJ's raw energy, disc 2 exhibits their more somber and bittersweet side. The first two openers are among the band's chilliest and moodiest songs in their catalogue. Its maiden ditty is the eleven-minute crescendo "Dondante" with James' elastic bellowing and a rather mournful saxophone infusion provided by Broemel as Bo Koester's keyboard licks just outright fizz on "Run Thru." It is with this disc's tracks that most of the fans probably had their lighters in the air and became utterly mesmerized. A My Morning Jacket show wouldn't be the same without a hypnotic barn-burner, and they provide one no less than stellar with the upbeat, down-home Kentucky feel of "Dancefloors." One of the many aspects that can render a live album a turkey is the sonic augmentation given to it post-concert. However, it seems as if mixer Michael Brauer (Paul McCartney, Coldplay) and the album's mastering by veteran Bob Ludwig (Tool, Nirvana) have done with Okonokos what Tom Down did in 1971 for the Allman Brothers on At Fillmore East and what his counterpart Bob Johnston did in 1968 for Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. He's captured the entire essence of the band's live synergy and the dexterity among the crowd regarding how they connect with the music. With Okonokos My Morning Jacket has established the precise middle-ground that exists between studio album and live album, which always rings true no matter what format you hear them. - Chris Pacifico www.JamBase.com | Go See Live Music! 
The absolute perfect medium for My Morning Jacket: THE LIVE ALBUM! I have been waiting for this for a couple of years now and it exceeds all my expectations. Yes, MMJ fans can be a little biased (they are, along with Wilco--although they have surpassed them, in my opinion--the best band on the planet at the moment!), any objective fan of good music will recognize the songwriting prowess and energy this album possesses. The version of Magheetah will leave you breathless. Guitars from outer space (yet organic as well), reverb drenched (yet perfectly clear) vocals from Mr. James, and a rythm section that's about as tight as any I have encountered, and absolutely NO FILLER. Perfect song selection. In the past, I have never been much of a fan of the live album, but betwen this one and Wilco's Kicking Television, I have been converted into a true believer. If you like radiohead, I am just preaching to the converted. If you are reading this review to figure whether or not to purchase this disc (s) at your local Tower, Best Buy or here at Amazon, run, don't walk. Plunk down your $14.99 NOW! While you're at it, pick up their newest (Z) and work your way backwards into their catalog. You won't regret it. Guaranteed. Unless you're a fan of Justin Timberlake, of course.. 
This is the album that every MMJ fan should have. It incorporates all the best of MMJ as well as taking familiar songs to a new level. The sound is crisp and they have never sounded better or more alive. The first disk is incredible, but it is the second disk that truly captures MMJ's live performances. Starting off the second disk with the epic Dondante and ending with a rollicking Mageetah, with the haunting Steam Engine in the middle, MMJ proves they are the best live band around 
There are rare times in life when I have sat at the edge of my seat and waited for a record release as impatiently as I had for Okonokos. I love the Jacket. Everything they do is brilliant. So to get a live double disk that showcases everything they do is just the icing on this double chocolate cake. Studio songs that have been ingrained in my head truly have a new life in the live format. Lowdown for instance, begins with a jam--unexpected, you just don't know what's coming up next, and then bam, "bye, bye, bye". At Dawn was made to be sung in the Fillmore. This is the VERB song of all VERB songs. Dondante the newest classic fades into the sweetest sax solo I've ever heard. What are these guys doing to me? Run Thru is CockRock at it's finest. But the highlight is Steam Engine. This is the quintessential MMJ song. When played live, it showcases everything behind this engine of a band. Please tell you friends to go out and buy this album. It's gold. 
This is a great live album for a great band that i love. Any My Morning Jacket fan will love this beautiful double live album. To be honest i was a little skeptical of a MMJ live album, mostly becuase their sound (reverb) is so hard to catch on a live recording. But somewhere in the world a genius pulled it off. Every song on this live album i love from the recorded versions, and live in person, and now on live recording. My only complaint is that i wish they would have had more songs from Tennessee Fire, but none the less this is a must buy for any fan who hasnt already pre-ordered it or expecting in the mail 
Well, let's get over the caveats first. The performance is heavily cut and this is a live performance from 1957, so the sound is certainly lo-fi, though not completely unacceptable. Otherwise, this is a treasurable account of a historic and absolutely thrilling night at La Scala. The cast is not totally ideal; Rossi-Lemeni as Enrico has great authority but his tone is woolly and leaks air at every emission; Raimondi doesn't have the florid technique for Percy (and consequently much of his role is cut), but he does have the requisite italianate tone. The rest is pure gold. Simionato as Giovanna shows just how exciting a singer she was on the stage; her studio recordings do not do her justice. A high point of the set is the duet with Anna, Callas and Simionato first striking sparks off each other and then blending in sublime harmony. As for Callas, this captures her at the absolute height of her interprative powers in a role that was absolutely right for her at this stage of her career. From the gentle, plangent tone she uses in the first aria, through the fire and brimstone of the Act 1 finale, to the exquisite pathos of the final mad scene, she is sublime. A high point of the set is her voicing of "Guidici ad Anna!" just before the Act 1 finale, where all Anna's queenly outrage is brought to bear with almost unbearable intensity. The finale is capped with a ringing high D and the audience quite rightly goes mad. But it is also in quiet moments that Callas is unique. The ovation she receives after the cavtina in the mad scene is the natural outcome from an audience quite obviously unable to hold its breath any longer - and remember this opera was almost completely unknown at the time. Though EMI did not record Callas in many of her greatest roles, it is good to see that they are now repairing the omission with the official release of some of these live performances. Not to be missed. 
Maria Callas is known as one of the greatest artist of the century because she was responsible for the revival of neglected bell canto operas. April 14, 1957 is one of those memorable days. It is the opening night of a new production of a great neglected opera Anna Bolena. This was staged in the La Scala. I am very happy that this particular event was documented in this recording. At least were able to listen to this spectacular memorable night. The Characterization of the La Divina is one of the most exciting she has done. This is probably because Anna's tragedy comes as a fusion of all the wounded characters she had played previously. This seems to be the catalyst she needed to pour deep emotions for the role. The final scene of this recording will make everybody understand why the La Divina is considered the greatest singing actress of the 20th century. It shows her at the height of her talent both as a tragic actress and of course as a singer. Despite poor recording and untolerable hisses in some parts. This recording should not be missed for any reason for this is the best Anna Bolena on Disc. 
Anna Bolena, Donizetti's great opera about the English queen who was beheaded by her husband Henry VIII, was a masterpiece rarely revived after its premiere. A year earlier, during 1956, the opera was revived in the composer's hometown. On 1957, with Luchino Visconti's guidance and the genius of Maria Callas at the helm, the opera was given at La Scala. In the pit was Gianandrea Gavazzenni, and the La Scala orchestra and chorus sang wonderfully that night. The set, a dramatic setting of dark shades contrasted by the fabulously brilliant costumes, helped to heighten the drama of the opera. But most fabulous of all was the Anna Bolena of the evening, Maria Callas. No other Anna had sung the role with much passion before, even approaching the boundaries of a verismo interpretation coupled with a well-schooled bel canto technique. There were many Annas who later would embellish the lines of the queen with greater roulades, but no other interpreter of the role could capture the tragic air that Callas gave the wife of Henry VIII. What makes this role such a great vehicle for her voice is the fact that Anna had much that related to the Druid priestess Norma. Both had lovers who had secretly conducted affairs behind their backs, and both were to discover this in the middle of the plot. What makes Anna different though, is the fact that her lover turned on her and even executed her! The colors brought into the writing of this role demand an entirely different kind of temperament from that of Norma. Anna has to maintain a sense of regality, yet she loses her temper in one of the scenes where she is to be brought before the judges. "Giudici! ad Anna!!!" The excerpt was to be sung to perfection by Callas, and no other singer could capture the fury she imbued in the cabaletta (something only Callas can do). "Va infelice", the duet between Jane Seymour and Anne, is much like Bellini's "Mira o Norma", and Giulietta Simionato and Callas sing it to a level of musicality unachieved by other singers. The madscene, the piece that closes this great opera, is undoubtedly the pinnacle of Donizetti's mad scenes. In my opinion, not even the famous Lucia di Lammermoor mad scene could equal the dramatic intensity of A Dolce Guidami...Coppia Iniqua. And who else could bring such dramatic truth into this mad scene than Callas? This scene alone is worth the entire recording, and I would highly recommend this Donizettian legend for your music library 
As a person of some wit I like to read reviews as much as I like posting them but how come that when it comes to Callas about 98% of the negative "reviews" are just insipid, hateful remarks with nothing to keep them up? Why did Beverly Sills get to sing all the Donizetti-Queens in the seventies? Because Maria Callas revived the neglected repertoire of Bellini, Donizetti, Cherubini etc. She herself admitted that and calls Callas her idol and inspiration. Were she to read such hateful remarks on her very beloved colleague she'd be furious! Callas got La Scala to produce a PREMIERE of Anna Bolena for her, a NEW production of this "oddity". And that is why this version is heavily cut as opposed to the complete Sills-set. (I don't need everything that was restored though...) Callas was in brilliant form that night in 1957 and Simionato SHINES equally. (I prefer her over too huge-voiced Verrett in this role for example) Listen to Callas' regal "Giudici!.......Ad Anna? GIUDICI! Ad ANNA?" and be floored by her! And how about her gorgeous singing in "Va infelice" and the incredible drama in "Mia RIVALE!" (A moment most other Annas wreck except for Sills and Gencer)? Rossi-Lemeni sounds brilliant as Henry VIII and the La Scala audience is at Callas' feet. Listen to it to find out why 
This is by far one of the best Callas-recordings. It was a miracle that in her time, when Bellini and Donizetti were so neglected, she got La Scala to produce Anna Bolena for her. She and Visconti created magic!! 
I never thought ANYONE could surpass my beloved Edita as Anna Bolena (I heard her live) but this just DID IT! I do prefer Gruberova in several roles but Callas OWNS Anna Bolena now. The best performance imaginable with a fantastic cast and a brilliant conductor! BRAVA 
A critic once called this his desert island recording. I'd like to repeat that. Even though it was already in the late fifties (Her 1956 Lucia wasn't very good, the 1955 was much better) here Callas had a top night. No wobbles, no screamed high notes and she is simply on fire. The problem here are the cuts and that is why my Nr. 1 Anna Bolena recording is the Sills-recording (Whose intensity was equally stunning) but I also LOVE this one. Callas sounds so beautiful in the duet with Giovanna... (The EXCELLENT Simionato) and her Al dolce guidami is dulcet indeed. I wonder why Gianni Raimondi never got more famous. He's an AMAZING Percy. The sound is pretty good for its time... IMHO no opera-collection is complete without it. (And the Sills-rec 
If this recording were uncut it would be heaven... But at this time it was a miracle that this rarity was performed at all, because Callas requested it. Callas sings a fantastic Anne, Simionato is the best Giovanna and Rossi-Lemeni has much authority as Henry VIII. This is still the greatest Anna Bolena 
devendra is just simply amazing. nothing more, nothing less. do yourself a favor and get this cd. you wont regret it if you know anything about good music 
Another reviewer praised a song on this record for McCartneyesque-whatever. Its 2006, D.B is a star now, and Paul McCartney doesn't really have new output thats interesting for anyone outside of the VFW bluehaired crowd. Cripple Crow, believe me I know, is brilliant in every conceivable way, even in making reviewers who dont like it realize what sad pathetic lives they have sitting around listening to 70 year olds who had their glory in 1960 and retired and old 28Special vinyls or whoever that is. Cripple Crow isnt for the fans of has beens but rather fresh and really truly more genuinally psychedelic than any crap from some retired old guy sir mccartsaschmuck could ever make even in his prime, who was a beatle...and Banhart doesnt need Beetles or wings or some kinda concept hogwash "band". When the whole "band is the guys name...thats like when the band isn't the star but the guy whose name provides the name of said band...like really great this is like great. Believe me i know. Its nothing like paul whateverhisname is, or some worn out old crap, or the geriatric stones who everyone goes around saying "ooooo, the new one rocks!!!" Like yeah, rocks like mullet and bic lighter concert crowd "wow ma, kickass. can i get a mullet too like your loser alcoholic boyfriend?!!!"-rocks. No, this really rocks, and doesn't smell like "some old guy shoulda retired and invested money in a restaurant chain" mildew(i.e: not fresh) But rocks like ?"yeah im fresh and was born in the last decade or three." -rocks. Not to rip on ""Paul-ese" McCart that awful sounding rubbish outta here" - Ney"" but theres no basis for comparison. If a movie was made that needded the good stuff we'de want this, not the easy rider soundtrack, like its silly. This is good and was recorded by someone young and fresh with new ideas. Dont listen to fools just buy it. Trust me im good and listen to music thats really good. Im from L.A. too and still dont say "ooooo it reminded me of the melodious solo wrok of Paul mccart-who? or worse yet Brian wilson. Plllllleeeease. So darn good 
I bought Banhart's first album when it came out and was a little turned off (honestly it's grown on me and I really like it now) but at the time it really turned me off. I found his two following albums easier to digest and very enjoyable but Cripple Crow is his strongest and most accessible album yet. The album is mellow and enjoyable and beyond that it is a sign of things to come. This album makes it clear that Devendra Banhart is the future of folk music and the future's so bright I gotta were shades (do you like that Timbuk 3 reference? You gotta say this review helped you just for that) 
I wonder if you're the type of person who gets completely obsessed over fragments of songs and rewinds them over and over on your iPod to 2.06? Oh, you're not a complete psycho? Well, why don't you try listening to 'Heard Somebody Say' and consider relabeling yourself. When Devendra sings, 'It's simple, we don't want to kill,' I get crazy and I don't even care about wars at all. It's true and right to the point, just like all his songs. He's really good at writing cute little songs that don't have a bag of darkness and depression drip-feeding them. That's good for your mental health. On 'Long-Haired Child,' he says he wants his baby to have long hair so his head won't get cold like his is. Well, I think that somebody should tell Devendra that his head sounds warm enough. Aw 
I hesitated to write a review on Devendra's work for a while, just because I don't have enough time to put into it. So, keep in mind that it is actually better than what I may say here. This is music is beautiful; from songs, to lyrics, to singing. You may ask yourself why is he obsessed with children? You know, Chinese Children, I Feel Just Like a Child, and Long Haired Child... But I tell you - can one not have fun? Put it on, enjoy 
More than enough has been said about Devendra's unique musical talents and style. His voice and the world it draws you into is nothing short of a swirling fever dream, a place that is almost perfectly encapsulated by the Sgt. Pepperesque album art. Devendra's songs will enlighten, charm, enliven, and in some instances frighten. Just as a warning, unless you are capable of allowing music to inhabit its own world and live by its own rules, you will find it difficult to fully let go and enjoy someone like Devendra Banhart. One example, the song "Little Boys", simply cannot be taken in literal terms without being borderline disgusting. "I see so many little boys I want to marry...I see plenty little kids I want to have...in the shower I get my dreaming done." As for me...I can appreciate that a song is a song...or if coming from Devendra, it's a trip. Trip on Devendra. Trip on 
"With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. " "Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit." It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however 
Some of you might already know this, but I didn't read any mention of it in the other reviews. There is a separate or "hidden" track that is about 8 minutes long called "White Reggae Troll/Africa". So, actually, this album has 23 tracks. I think this track's title further identifies the subtle Reggae influences, infused with folk, rock, alternative, bluegrass and other genres that amalgamate into the entirety of Cripple Crow. Banhart is an excellent neo-folk talent whom I first heard on Antony and the Johnson's "I Am a Bird Now" album. The tracks are musically and lyrically diverse, performed in both Spanish and English, united by a calm, earthy undertone that is pleasant like Iron and Wine (though comfortably distinct). Though these tracks are largely mellow, it grooves with enough soul to keep the listener from falling asleep. The music has an indigenous quality to it; I'm using that term a little loosely. It just makes me think of the music that the aboriginal musicians would be making today if most of them hadn't been killed off. Cripple Crow will make a superb addition to your collection. The album offers a nice balance of longer songs interspersed with shorter ones, which comprise about 80 minutes worth of fun, contemplative and poetic tunes to keep your heart at peace. I rate this album at 4.2 stars. It improves after several listens, like Nick Drake albums did for me 
...I'd still have Chinese children. Devendra has done us all a favor here by expanding his sound to fit the ears of even the most jaded or ignorant listeners. He's packed this CD with enough hits--"Long Haired Child" etc.--to keep most anyone interested, but also includes enough asides and downright folky tracks to stay indie. It works with tremendous clarity on Cripple Crow. He has a keen ear for genre-blends and throwback instrumentation, which, coupled with his already acute lyrics makes this album one of the must-haves of 20005. If you like folk music, if you like the Beach Boys, if you like easy, classic sounds coming from your speakers, then get Cripple Crow immediately and discover why Devendra Banhart has been a critics' darling for several years now 
I'm not sure, maybe I just got ripped off, but is there supposed to be only 1 song that is 9 minutes long on the cd? 
Totally enjoyable vibrant music. Saw them in a small venue tonight (25 people) and am hooked. Talented and personable. Join in 
Thanks to WFUV in NY, I went to their concert at the Rubin Museum and discovered a duo with a beautiful sound. Their folk music is fused with all sorts of cultural traditions and an all-inclusive brand of spirituality. For me, Maura's voice and Pete's guitar are as good as any I can recall, and their energy is infectious 
With the exception of the last track (clearly an "outtake" that should have been left behind) this album is perfect and still deserves 5 stars. The arrangements are subtle and well considered: emphasizing the fuzzy guitar and melodious bass, they're not afraid to add a synth, or even accordion, when it fits. The vocals are mumbly and understated, filling the song as another instrument would, rather than as a singer plus backup. At various moments they resemble early R.E.M., Radiohead, and (in their quieter songs) the Shins but this is not a derivative band by any means. Simply put, the Wrens know, as well as ony of those more famous acts, how to write and perform a beautiful song; and they put a dozen of them together for this remarkable self-produced album 
I spent almost two weeks sifting through low-key record stores trying to find this pristine indie gem. I had first heard it on the net, and being instantly enamored, I set out to find it. Two weeks later, I gave up, denoting that almost all record stores are commercial descensions of mainstream feces, with all the great stuff being limited to the likes of Amazon. Of course, as I was already compelled to do so, and had been browsing here forever, I ordered with confidence. And so I took the plunge, and paid with due haste. Three days later, sooner than expected, this arrived in the mail. The cover is simple, as is the innards. You'd think this was some kind of cheapie by the looks, but as soon as you pop it into your CD player, you know it's not, by far. I've been listening to this album on repeat since I received it yesterday. I haven't even considered removing it yet. There's something subtly amazing about the sound, with almost-whining vocals and powerfully supporting instrumentation, that charms the listener endlessly. It was worth the order. If you love music, you'll love this 
The Wrens' "The Meadowlands" comes very close to being a classic, as chances are that you'll love it. The only problem here is that singer Charles Bissell is not that likable (I can see a lot of people not liking him too much). He does a good enough job, but if he were more likable then the album would benefit much better as a whole. The lyrics tend to be pretty forgettable and hard to hear, though at times they can be interesting. Musically the production is great and the band sounds like a lo-fi-ish indie rock band with a little alternative and punk thrown in. The best tracks are arguably "Faster Gun" and "Per Second Seconds". Thankfully every other track on here is good, too. They somehow manage to create their own sound even though it also sounds relatively familiar and derivative. It's not the most appealing album ever, but if you're into the style it's a very good album. Not everyone will like it, though. All in all this is highly recommended! Highlights include: the entire album 
It's funny to hear an album so challenging AND accessible. The songs are amazing on every level: melodies, lyrics, arrangements. Each one is a perfect vignette, as perceptive as a Chekhov story, as catchy as a Hard Day's Night. The pacing of the album is a bit off-putting: slowish for a while, building into the crash of "Everyone Choose Sides", exhaling with "13 Months in 6 minutes". I listen to a LOT of indie guitar music, and this is among the very best ever. I'm not even going to bother with the standard "Sounds like the bastard chold of Band X and Group Y." The Wrens sound like the Wrens. Which is to say, Awesome 
WOW!!! This is the first time I have heard this band. Truely amazing album. Builds and builds,... then erupts into an explosive experience of screw the main stream blissfulness. Yeah I said it, priceless 
An absolute favourite. Why this band are not more famous mystifies me (well, the label disputes and lack of output help explain it a little). Still, had this album been presented to me as a modern classic, well known in its native America, I would not have been surprised. I wasn't expecting much from The Meadowlands, bought on the back of some other more keenly anticipated albums. The rather dull sleeve didn't help, either. It took a short while to appreciate the layered texture of the music and the pattern in what initially sounded like almost random percussion. But after giving this album a few listens, I was richly rewarded. They have created a sound of their own - rare enough - and use it to great effect. The album is cohesive but the tracks do stand out from each other. The singer's voice takes a little getting used to but grows after a few listens. The two main openers, 'Happy' and 'She Sends Kisses' are still favourites but it's becoming harder and harder to point to a track that I don't like very much. The slight edginess doesn't make it immediately accessible but there is plenty to keep you returning. I really would put his album on a level with much more well known, revered albums. Music that you want to tell everyone about. They'll probably stay under the radar for a good while longer but this album is a real treat. Just hope they can re-release the other ones.. 
It took them long enough, but The Wrens were able to follow up their brilliant effort, Secaucus, with a CD that was even better. The Meadowlands is by far their most sprawling (and crisp) work yet (okay, granted, throughout their 11 year career, they've only put out 3 CDs, two of which are out of print, and one EP). The CD grabs at you and doesn't let go, mixing soft-yet-engaging tracks with heartwrenching lyrics to upbeat songs with thrashing guitar that you can't help but get swept up by, even when they reveal an underyling cynicism. It seems almost counter-productive to list off which individual tracks are worth listening to- there isn't an off song in the entire album. "Happy" and "She Sends Kisses" breaks your heart and then brings you back up with its grand, almost ballad quality, while "Boys, You Won't" finds you slowly nodding your head as it builds and builds. "Ex Girl Collection" and "Everyone Choose Sides" are uptempo and catchy as hell, while maintaining the incredibly strong lyrics evident throughout. For those of you who hear from reviews here that it's "Emo", and are worried about that- don't be. Granted, I find that Emo is often overused currently, the choice word to describe an album that deals with any topic that is less-than-cheery, and the lyrics may seem to meet that qualification for some (For example- "Are you happy now?/ Got what you want/ I wanted you/ but I'm over that now"), but it's just an album with these artists dealing with themselves honestly, and it results in deeply personal, yet brilliant, lyrics. This is a must-own-CD 
It is interesting how often we find ourselves in situations that we could never have imagined. It is not easy to start off whith a certain direction and mind and find yourself in completly different circumstance than you anticipated. the Wrens document this expierience with the skill that really shows how much they have felt the suprise inherient in aming one direction and going another. Not so long ago the Wrens were an engergetic promising young band that were supposed to be the next big thing. To make a long story short, the Wrens failed to change their sound to meet this exspectation, their record company found a new band to replace them (a little known group called Creed) and the Wrens were history. Or not. Over the years the Wrens have released some very solid material at a very slow pace. Yet nothing they, or anyone else, have released in the last ten years compares to the Meadowlands. The record starts out with a slow, bummed-out song called The House That Guilt Built. "I'm nowhere near where I thought I'd be" sings Charles Bissell. A slow build continues with the excellent "Happy". A song that starts out with a lagging beat and seemingly random guitar figure. By the time the Wrens have been betrayed and gotten even the track has transformed into a beautifully textured rock out. Other highligts include "She Sends Kisses", "This Boy Is Exausted", and the spectacular "Hopeless". Great production abounds through out. All of the Wrens can sing and these harmonies really flesh out songs that are already packed with sonic texture. Key boards bang out melodies on top of mutiple guitar parts and help create an all consuming sound. This is a wonderful piece of art because the Wrens have nailed an asthetic and emotional vision and made a consistantly great record. There are no poor parts and if you buy this record, you will have no regrets 
The Wrens' third album, The Meadowlands, is a sprawling, shifting affair, perhaps reflecting the fact that it took some time (four years) to be created. The album itself is also long, and the way that its songs jump and shift in tone and mood from bitterness (2 first songs) to gentler sounds only to lead us again into melancholy suggests a series of journal entries strung together, connected loosely by an overall brokenhearted feeling. Now, fort this guy called J. Carroll (February 5th,2005) misspelling emo for "elmo", you better try to wear some fine eyeglasses first. He (or is a she?)began to criticize all of us who like 'emo-core" because he can't find a link between the little red puppet and this style of music. I was reading the review hoping to find that all that self-created mess with the elmo issue was a joke, but no, he began drowning more and more into the ocean of naiveness, what a neurotic conduct, all that for a miserable "L". Groups like the wrens, mineral, sunny day real estate, gloria record and the like, don't deserve such a "fan" 
I'm an old 33-yo sumbitch been listening to independent, obscure and even alternative rock and pop for about 20 of them. Last few years, I start seeing the prefix elmo- added to bands I've been listening to forever. Someone tell me why Fugazi, for instance, is all of a sudden affiliated with a Sesame Street character (although he sure as hell wasn't one when I watched Sesame Street back in the old days, or as these Elmo lovers would say "the day.") Do you Elmo dudes get paid Amway style to add the Elmo- prefix to any music you happen to like? What the F does it even mean to call something Elmo music? Please enlighten, because I have somehow managed to avoid exposure to a definition so far. Thanks! Oh yeah. Meadowlands kicks it. Aw yeah. Don't know that it's really Elmo, however 
The Killers are really something special in the world of music today. There are a band that uses meloncholy new wave sound that is able to put smiles on peoples faces and have them sing along. 'Hot Fuss' was a real coming out for this band but their new cd 'Sam's Town' is not getting the same vibes from many people. This new album has the fans split right down the middle. The first single 'When You Were Young' is just not getting the same feeling as 'Somebody Told Me.' Yet this group is not going in the wrong direction. This is a band like many before them that plans to stick around for while by experimenting and trying new things to see how far they can go. Those types of bands are the ones that stand the test of time. 'Sam's Town' is a real triump there are great songs on this record and even some that keep the origional Killers sound. Songs like 'Bones' and 'See My Mind' keep the fans interested while the rest are a new breath of fresh air which is what the music world so desperatly needs. So take a listen and try and keep an open mind. 
The Killers return with their sophomore set, "Sam's Town". This time out, they emerge more confident and with a harder guitar-driven edge. The synths are still here, but they're pushed to the back, or utilized to help the melodies along. There are plenty of hit singles here such as their first, "When You Were Young" with its U2-like chorus and guitar flourishes. The title track is a mix of Duran Duran and Rush while "Bling (Confession Of A King)" and "For Reasons Unkown" emphasize the tougher guitars while maintaining a delicate balance of synths. "Read My Mind" would be my choice for second single. The band hits a few speed bumps along the way during the second half of the disc with "Uncle Jonny" and "My List", but this is more than compensated for with other good songs "Bones", "This River Is Wild" and "Why Do I Keep Counting?". The Killers avoid the sophomore slump issue and show that they are here to stay. Strong melodies, rocking guitars and intelligent/poetic lyrics keep "Sam's Town" a cut above other releases of 2006 
Sam's Town can in no way be compared to Hot Fuss because it's a completely different album and sound. I love Sam's Town and I love Hot Fuss. There have been complaints I realize, but for a maturing, talented band such as The Killers, change is required to keep interest. I definitely recommend Sam's Town but not if you're looking for another Hot Fuss 
What happened to the band that recorded "Hot Fuss"? What happened to the electro-dance charged, hi-energy rock-poppy group that recorded "Somebody told me" and "Mr. Brightside"? I remember in the press this band was hailed as the best British rock band to come from America. This is definitely not the same band. This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith. If you liked their last album, pass on this one. If you dig more "adult-contempory" stuff, this may be right up your alley. Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one. If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called "The Faint". They'll pick up where this once-great band left off. As a side note, Mr. Flowers has a fantastic voice on the last album.. Theres some real studio magic going on there.. I saw them live and that guy sounds terrible 
I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection. 
All the songs on the album, except for When You Were Young, are a drag. It sounds like the songs were written on the fly. What happened to the melodies and retro synth sounds from Hot Fuss?! (I really liked that album.) I am not sure what direction The Killers were/are headed---I think they got lost in Sam's Town. To answer "we hope you enjoyed your stay" in track 12.... Not really. Sorry 
Some albums are an acquired taste that take a couple of spins to appreciate. Not so with SAM'S TOWN. The sounds on the albums are eclectic and fresh. I felt like that band took each song in a new direction. None of them felt recycled or tacked on. I was surprised as I listened to it how different one song was from the next. This made for an exciting listen that will provide a lot of replay value. The runtime of the album is just under 45 minutes. It seemed a little short to me - though I have no idea what the average runtime of a record is. Actually, I was surprised when the CD was over. Usually, even on some of my favorite albums, I have to skip a couple of songs that are just filler. I did no such thing here, so the concise runtime is a credit to the "all killer (pun definitely intended) no filler" catch-phrase. I'm happier with an album that delivers throughout even if it is less lengthy than comparable releases. All-in-all, I'm glad to say, SAM'S TOWN is a worthy follow-up to HOT FUSS, and hopefully means that the Killers are here to stay. Buy this album. 
The sound of The Killers remains me Split Enz with Phil Seymour voice or another groups of this Split Enz member: Schnell Fenster or The Swingers. Anyway, this is a great CD and a great Rock group. Buy It 
I am in love with this album and although "Hot Fuss" was a solid cd, "Sam's Town" blows it out the water. The lyrics, music, and gehenral flow of the songs are incredible and it's quite clear that Brandom FLowers has worked on his vocals for the new album. I think some peopel don't like it because it's not an exact copy as "Hot Fuss" and it may not offer that Top 40 cookie cutter TRL style that a lot of people sadly have grown to respect and enjoy (ie: Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, among others). I can't stop listening to it and -it has liek nothing to do with liek how h0t the liek singer liek is-, a reason why some people unfortunately know who The Killers are. The Killers have not completey changed their sounded, but tweaked it slightly to create a unique and probably one of the year's best albums. I think it's fantastic and worth every dollar and minute spending enjoying this record 
This is a good album because it has some of the elite rappers in the game today. When this trio gets together for a single or a cd like this, u know its gonna be hot. Some of my favorite joints on this cd are 213 Tha Gangsta Clicc because Nate Dogg goes beyond just singing into a rap style that is off the hook, Joysticc is a great sexual song (gotta have some of those on there), and So Fly is a great single that was released about 10 months before the cd was even released. Groupie Luv is also a single with a music video which is an ok song. Overall, I give this album 3 1/2 bricketts 
213 has always been revered as the West Coast super-group that the public never got to hear. But the demo tapes and leaked basement sessions were always a tease to the fans of the braidless Snoop Dogg, the DJ Warren G, and the pre-fedora Nate Dogg. For the last five years, each of the aforementioned has promised this album on a list of different labels, different title and different themes. What it boiled down to was Snoop, Nate and Warren finding themselves with some spare time on their hands. The Hard Way portrays a crew of artists in search of the creative vigor they had a dozen plus years ago as the original 213. Warren G has trademarked himself as the laid back MC. From hits like "This DJ", to the more recent, "I Want it All", he's never been expected to raise his voice, or stray from his effortless flow. Snoop, on the other hand, was at one time an edgy MC with range and emotion. From his sharp and venomous verses on tracks like, "Pump Pump" and "The Shiznit," Snoop was deft at sticking words up under your ribcage. Older tracks are reference points because those are the days that 213 hail from. It was not the overly laid back Snoop, the slightly less laid back Warren, and the impromptu Nate. That is exactly what we're getting. A too smooth, thus energy-lacking effort, that sounds more like a Gap Band album than any Hip-Hop triad. The most blatant rap tracks like, "213 Tha Gangsta Clicc" and "MLK" are dominated by aggressive synthesized beats. The softer side of things shine through because the better half of this album comes from smooth tracks like, "Another Summer", "Run On Up", and "Lil' Girl." Warren G's cadences throughout the album are taking on an all-too close resemblance to his half-brother, Dr. Dre's style of delivery. "MLK" and "Absolutely" are major proof of that. On the lyrical side of things, Nate steals the show. "Mary Jane" and "So Fly" are two of the album's more exciting cuts that reveal Nate's fabulous quality. He doesn't stay boxed-in by hooks, but rather Nate Dogg dances around most verses of this album with that one-of-a-kind baritone croon. Luckily, Dave Chapelle's Rick James persona is the only guest, lasting an interlude. But, in the wake of Rick's death, the humor is lost. While 213 didn't water-down their album with outsiders, much is to be desired considering the years of hype. One of the most disturbing facts of a 213 album is that it has no producer. Warren G has refused to produce anything since the lackluster sales of his last album. As a result, this album uses music supplied by producers who have no cognition of what the original 213 was, is or should sound like. The only reputable producer that fits the mold is DJ Pooh, who is responsible for "Groupie Luv." While Nottz, Hi-Tek, and Kanye West are wonderful producers, this wasn't their place. The one effort that does seem to match an early vibe, is "Joysticc." This track uses "Juicy Fruit" percussion, with thick synth tones and a new wave chorus. Another track that Nate dominates is "So Fly." This outstanding soul chop (with vinyl hiss) is provided by none other than Missy Eliot. We can even forget that Smilez Southstar tried this same beat before. Otherwise, this album barely separates itself from an Eastsidaz album. Perhaps the hardest reality of this album is the jaded element. It's hard to watch your heroes get so cocky they forget why they're originally in it. It had been widely hoped that this album would be a return to the way things were. Instead, we have three aging stars in total ignorance of their history together, using their fame and wealth as large subject matter, over foreign production. After a dozen years of believing that 213 was the West's super group, this album only affirms the fact that it's truly Westside Connection who wears that crown. 2.5 outta' 5 
As a group originally brought to most people's attention in 1992, and one that was supposed to be putting an album out in the mid to late 90's, we finally got to hear an album from the Long Beach natives, 213, with 17 songs. As a few others have said, it doesn't really have a G-Funk sound (which made them famous and rich) and not many well known producers they worked with in the past that made their songs great (Warren G doesn't even produce one on here) but it still is a good album. All 3 are on every song except one doesn't have Snoop. Guests are on 2 songs and only do the hooks. It has no classic, 4 ok songs, 2 I skip and th others are good. Prodcution is handled by Quaze, B Sharp, Tha Chill, J Hen (they all do 2 songs), and Missy Elliot, Hi Tek, DJ Pooh, Nottz, Josef Leimberg, Lil half Dead, Fly 2K, Michael Angelo, all doing 1 song. Lyrics are what you'd expect, a few dirty songs, a few gangsta songs and a few smoking/relaxing type songs. A good album to have for their fans. #2 - 8 (f/ Dion) #3 - 8 #4 - 8 #5 - 9 #6 - 8 (about groupies) #7 - 8.5 (about a lonely girl -- nice beat) #8 - 6.5 (f/ Latoiya Williams) #9 - 5 (horrible beat) #10 - 8.5 #11 - 7 #12 - 9 (upbeat dirty song -- no Snoop) #14 - 9 (about smokin w33d) #15 - 5.5 #16 - 8 #17 - 7 (dirty song) #18 - 7 #19 - 8.5 (nice relaxing beat) SNOOP DOGG -- Calvin Broadus -- b. 10/20/72 --- Long Beach, CA NATE DOGG -- Nathaniel Dwayne Hale -- b. around 1972 -- Long Beach, CA WARREN G -- Warren Griffin III -- b. 11/10/70 -------- Long Beach, CA 213 -- LBC!!! check all my review 
This is one of the two best rap groups on the market. The other being the three some of WC, Mack 10 and Ice Cube, aka West Side Connection. WSC specializes in hardcore gangasta rap and does it better than anyone since NWA. 213 is a smoother sound that is in no way soft but is much less abrasive than WSC. Snoop and Warren G blend their superlative "G-Funk" sound with Nates incredibly soulful voice, and mix them over entertaining lyrics that will still be well worth listening to in ten years. I love the album and can't wait for the next round. Other groups (Murder INC) will be nothing more than a foot note and as consequential as "The Candyman". Solid album front to back 
..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so I can't understand why they put this out. The album lacks quality, imagination, energy, and inspiration. There isn't one G funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff. I've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole CD in a short space of time. To you Gangsta listeners out there, don't waste your money....i ain't gonna go on any more about this album so if you don't believe me..buy it 
This album offers something unheard for a long time; west coast rap. Could have been better with Warren G producing rather than rapping as he is clearly overshadowed by Snoop Dogg's abilities but Nate Dogg steals the limelight. The 'Ghetto Crooner' is on top form for the entire album his hooks are sublime and his rap contribution is of good standard too! Although some tracks stand high above others it is almost impossible to skip a single track. Highlights include: 'So Fly', 'Mary Jane', 'MLK', 'Another Summer', 'Lonely Girl', 'Gotta Find A Way' and 'Appreciation' 
213 takes a trip back a decade to re-visit that G-Funk sound that was popular in the 90's, and they do it well! They do this in opposition of most rappers' tendencies to go bubblegum pop style in 2004. Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg,and Warren G have great chemistry and still use that same reminiscent lyrical style that made them popular way back then. The beats are G-Funk, reminiscent of the old-school, yet updated enough for the 21st century. One track really stands out: "Appreciation" it has a nice, bass heavy beat with faint use of the whiny, whistly keyboard synthesizer in the hooks reminiscing of 1990's hip-hop. The lyrics are superior; they give love to those that have helped them grow as people and artists. Nate Dogg's R hooks sound tight on each song. Don't sleep on this one!!!!!! 
this album wuz relli good i dont hav much to say about it cuz it speaks for it self but all i gotta say is its worth buyin if u like snoop nd nate dogg duz sum good work in there on songs also warren g brings hot lyrics Top 5 Lonely Girl Joysticc My Dirty Ho Groupie Love So Fl 
I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
Prince found a lot of success with his 1982 album "1999". I think it is one of his best. It's very funky and enjoyable. Originally a double album, as most of the songs are very long in length. "Little Red Corvette" was the highest charting single from the album. On the title song, Prince wants us to party like it's 1999. It's a great track. As usual, there is some social commentary on the album throughout the songs, which is nice. The songs are really funky. The album does sound a bit dated today, but it's still a great album start to finish. Lots of great synth work on here, and percussion. Once again Prince produced, arranged, composed and performed on the album. Highlights include "Automatic", "Lets Pretend We're Married", "D.M.S.R.", "Delirious" and many more. The whole album is a crowning acheivement 
Although Prince had been putting out a stream of R hits for years before, this album really put Prince into the mainstream. A massive hit, this album stayed on the charts for years, spinning off several hit singles, highlighted by the two biggest, "1999", the title track, and "Little Red Corvette", Prince's biggest hit to that point. "Delirious" and "Let's Pretend We're Married" also hit the charts, and the album went on to sell over two million copies. Prince has never been one to trim anything, being more than willing to play a nine or ten minute song just to get the groove going, and this album has many songs clocking in at nine+ minutes. The revealing thing is that you're never bored with it. The vocal work here is outstanding. The multi-voice lead, used so perfectly in "1999", is first used on this album, and it realy was a unique thing to hear, especially on a Prince album. There are many funky grooves to get down to, and some really steamy slow-downs to enjoy as well. Truthfully, many consider this album to be Prince's true masterwork, better even than "Purple Rain", the album that made him a mega-star. Even though I don't think this myself, I can see why so many are enamored of this album. It rocks, it's funky, it's danceable, it's slinky. Get this album even if you're not a Prince fan. It's definately one of his all-time best, which means it's a true work of art 
"1999" is often called Prince's "breakthrou" album but those of us in the r community had known about this prodigy since his 1st album, "FOR YOU" releashed in 1978.Heck, true Prince fans still remembered the time he was booed off stage, while opening for the "Rolling Stones". I guess America was'nt ready for something fresh and exciting at the time. But in 1983 apparrently it was.The first 3 songs "1999","Lil Red Corvette", and "Delirious" get this album off to a roaring start and the party never stops 
'1999' is funky, fresh, and very catchy....He's got some pop-friendly cuts like '1999' and 'Little Red Corvette' that are impossible not to love...Then he's got some crazy 'out there' but infectious songs like 'automatic' 'all the critics love you in NY' and 'lady cab driver'....And of course the clever balad "international lover".... Although I was too young (I might not even have been born yet) to remember those days, I think the general consensus is that this was the album that propelled Prince to super-star status and solidified his position as one of the most creative and unique musicians of his time, or any time period for that matter... 
I bought this CD in a nostalgia-induced music buying bender and have had it in heavy rotation ever since. Unlike Def Leppard's often cringeworthy 'Pyromania,' (my sincere apologies, guys)1999 has stood the test of time--and then some. If you haven't listened to this album in a long while or if you (gasp) have never heard it, you owe it to yourself to give the early genius that is Prince a listen. While I used to choreograph dance routines to 'Little Red Corvette' in my basement when I was in sixth grade, now I vacuum my livingroom with it cranked. (Sad but true.) At least I have Prince to ease the pain of aging 
Released in 1982, Prince's hard-driving double album was his first recorded masterwork. "1999" holds up beautifully and features a wealth of terrific music: "Little Red Corvette," "Delirious," "Automatic," "Let's Pretend We're Married," "D.M.S.R." and the apocalyptic title track. Breakthrough rock and funk from one of the medium's few geniuses 
I'm going to make the claim that Prince's "1999" isn't as cool as "Purple Rain" (this one starts off worse, at least), but if you like Prince or pop music then you're going to love it anyway. Every song here is great straight-up pop music and everything about it is well done. Prince is still a great singer here, although I WOULD argue that he's more of a guilty pleasure here than he is on "Purple Rain". That's not too much of an issue, but it's something to keep in mind. I would argue that, if you're not into Prince or pop music all that much, then this isn't the Prince album to get. "1999" is the most accessible song here, I think - it's a relatively sweet dance track. Anyways - the musical style here is pretty similar to "Purple Rain", too, as it's essentially new wave, pop and a little hard rock thrown in to make one interesting sounding package - it's definitely 80's, though (it's a tad dated sounding). Its historical importance and style definitely add to its rating and worth. The lyrics are usually pretty interesting and catchy, so they're also worth paying attention to. Overall, I think that this is still an awesome and original Prince album, but I don't think non-Prince or pop music fans will like it necessarily. They might, but the chances of this are less so than on "Purple Rain". If you like the style, though, this is a great CD to own! Highly recommended! Highlights include: the entire album 
If Prince wasn't a superstar already with his last 2 albums, this album was defenitely one that made him one. "1999" was Prince's 5th album and released in 1983. It's perhaps the most funky album to date, full of syntesizers and computer electronic beats. His own band "The Revolution" hadn't yet joined but they feauture on several songs de facto. He also managed 3 pretty big single hits from this album, an improvement from previous albums. For Me, 1999 was one of the most typical early 80's albums, based on sound and melody it gives a good preview of trends during the new wave in the early 80's. This album could be the un-official soundtrack. The title track 1999 is one of the catchiest here, it got this funky 80's pop melody with synthesizers and it's lyrics are very typical for it's time "War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight, So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight". It's a protest song to the Reagan administration. Jill Jones Lisa Coleman and guitarist Dez Dickerson share lyrics on the title track for example, "They say two thousand zero zero party over,oops out of time, So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999" The hook is infectious, even today. Ironically, it wasn't til it's second re-release that it became a single hit. "Little Red Corvette" was this album's biggest hit, it's also the song most towards traditional "pop". The song is all about sex and switching partners in a age where HIV was up and coming, but apart from previous explicit sexual songs "Corvette" used obscure meanings, "Trojans" reffer to condoms and Jockey's represent men who have previously slept with the girl. "Delerious" is another catchy pop song, also a hit. It's about sex, it's the funky sound that made it a good pop song. "Let's Pretend We're Married" follows the same formula, I love the lyrics here. 8 minute long "D.M.S.R" is a odd number, perhaps the most infectious beats on this album, it's a real club song signed Prince. "Automatic" is not the same song that the Pointer Sisters made. This one is also a club song, with cool beats and it's 9:24 minutes!!!Eventually they computer generate Prince's voice and it got a nice guitar solo. ". Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)" is a catchy midtempo. It's about women treating their men bad. "Free" is it some kind of sarcasm to the American society? Starts slow but eventually turns out to be a psychedelic gospel song. "Lady Cab Driver" is fantastic, not only the catchy beats it got (remind me of Paula Abdul's "Straight Up") Prince and Jill share lyrics here, but it becomes a sex act instead, while Jill is making sounds, Prince makes alot of diffrent dedications. "All The Critics Love You in NY" is almost spoken, I don't know if it's a love message to the city or a joke towards newspapers. "International Lover" is an excellent and romantic closer, Prince is the captain of a airplane and he's crusing through the world with his dates to make love. The most erotic song here for sure and one of his most passionable. 1999 is an excellent album, and one of his absolute best. Most songs are pretty long from 4 minutes to 9 and a half. It's a funky album with infectious beats and many party songs. It was also his most commercially successful album by then and by now a classic. Should have 
I am very satisfied with the 1999 CD by Prince. It was in top condition when it arrived. I would purchase again from the seller. thank 
I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!! In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way. Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin 
Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it 
Does anyone know the song being played when they raid jonny tran's place?? I can't find it anywhere

does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
When I saw the Gang of Four perform live in the early 80s, bassist Dave Allen, a brilliant musician, was, sadly, gone, though in his place was a fairly decent replacement, Sara Lee. The Go4 were true post-punk progressives, who sought to elevate women rock musicians as the equals of men, at a time when this was still a novel concept. In fact, the Gang of Four's progressivism was partly the result of the earthshaking consequences of 1970s British punk, of which this band was definitely a part (their first recording - the Damaged Goods EP - was released in 1978, still the punk heyday). Their progressivism was also a result of their university education in philosophy, and specifically, in the neo-marxist critical theory of scholars like Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Antonio Gramsci, all of whose work informs the Gang's lyrical content and sensibilities. But these were also smart young men, loaded with talent, living in a world in which they felt alienated. Seeing them live was great! They rocked, and they connected with the audience, a large gathering of mostly Americans who were deeply in to them. And lead singer John King certainly had the funky white guy thing going on, as he was constantly in motion on stage, as guitarist Andy Gill riffed away, fearlessly and energetically. Here, on Solid Gold, mixing punk, postpunk, funk, dance, and just a bit of free jazz, the Gang of Four wildly succeed in producing one of the 80s finest musical hours. The key to this record are probably the tight rhythms which the band produces. In fact, the bass lines here are anything but simple, whereas the guitar lines are effectively simple, and sharply rhythmic. Also, the band's messages are a bit less cryptic and thus a bit clearer than on Entertainment, which seemed so immersed in social theory (though, of course, this recording has a song called Why Theory?, about praxis, with the clever split of the vocals between King and Gill). The messages of song's like Capital (It Fails Us Now), History's Bunk!, and If I Could Keep It For Myself are pointedly clear, not to mention very insightful. One other observation. This has some of this band's best, and best known, songs, including What We All Want (which they've recently re-recorded), In The Ditch, Outside The Trains Don't Run On Time, and To Hell With Poverty. 
One of my all time favorite albums. I have listened to the newly remastered version of "Entertainment" side by side with my "Infinite Zero" version from the early 90's. Oooohhhhh! ...now there is so much more midrange... the treble doesn't bleed into white noise nearly as much... its louder too. So I'm ordering this one now and looking forward to the same improvement. Review edit: I've since recieved this CD. WARNING: it is merely a reissue of the 1996 EMI(UK) release. Remasters have come a long way since then. It should not be promoted as such. I sent it back as I already have the 1995 Infinite Zero(US) release. "Entertainment" is a genuine 2005 Remaster by Rhino, "Solid Gold" is not 
Had the band never recorded a suitable follow-up to "Entertainment", they'd probably have left us wondering forever (as with Captain Beefheart) "How great would they have sounded if recorded with a fuller, more life-like sound rather than the dry clipped one they favored (on Entertainment)". Here we get a full sound, lots of bass, lots of everything. The material's less intricate than on the preceeding LP, and the lyrics maybe a bit less sharp, but they still sound great (infused here by dub reggae, and PIL's bass-driven meanderings). It's must-hear and it rocks and swings hard. The bonus tracks here are quite worthwhile, and I think the live version of "What We All Want" is quietly massive.  
I feel bad for the guy who got this with Hard. Yes Hard sucks! I got this with Another Day/Another Dollar, which is awesome. Every song is brilliant except for "Why Theory?". Gang Of Four is usually the smartest band ever. One of the few that realize how the environment shapes our behavior. In this song however they say, "How We Think changes How We Act". A common sense belief, but completely wrong. I think we can all agree we many times think something and behave completely differently. To have a causal effect something must happen 100% of the time. It doesn't. A more accurate statement is how we act changes how we think. Thought is unverbalized speech and not a tangible thing, It can not cause things. Enough philosophy though. This album is awesome. Much darker than Entertainment! musically, but also more varied. This one two punch is one of the best ever. Solid Golid is highly recommended with the brilliant Another Day/Another Dollar 
Gang of Four's second album is a far more jagged affair then their classic debut "Entertainment". Solid Gold is a much more bass and drum oriented record with Andy Gill's static slashing hoving above. Solid Gold has held up as my favorite GOF album. With the addition of "Another Day Another Dollar" this is a must have - To Hell with Poverty is a classic dance club track from the mid-eighties and the live version of "What we all want" with it's 'in the face' bass brought to the front of the mix are fantastic. Just for clarification, Solid Gold and Another Day were the combo released first (by Rollins), then the mix of SG and Hard which I thought a bit confusing as it skipped "Songs of the Free" which was GOF's third album and quite a strong release (dave allen left and formed Shriekback with Barry Andrews (ex of XTC) and Sara Lee (League of Gentlemen with Robert Fripp) took over the bass duties - 
To be brief....stark, funky and driven with intelligent lyrics. Top ten disc of all tim 
I am so glad I waited to buy this album again on cd as it also includes the another day another dollar EP. The 1981 follow up is just as good an album that entertainment was in terms of writing. I think the delivery of lyrics is as good as well. For some odd reason this has been released recently and paired with the not so great album Hard (Dave Allen had left by then) stay away from that unless you liked that pairing of albums. This had been released by the now defunct label infinite zero (Rick Rubin and Henry Rollins ran it I believe). There second best album and their swan song as follow up albums weren't as great. I would definitely recommnend this to any gang of four fan. This is a budget priced release so look around for a better price (I did) 
I bought this CD a little over a year ago and, having already been a huge fan of Gang of Four's Entertainment! album, I was eager to hear what other sounds this band had in store for me. As I drove out of the Amoeba parking lot, I chose Hard/Solid Gold out of the many purchases I had made that night to listen to first on the drive home (a place of no small distinction). Words can't describe my disappointment--rather than hearing a band even similar to the one I heard on Entertainment!, I instead got some cheesy post-disco 80's pop that clearly had the same singers as the Gang of Four that I knew and loved, maybe even some similar guitar work, but all in all, left me feeling flat and empty with it's faux Motown backup singers and drum machine beats. If I wanted a GOOD version of this sound, I would have purchased a New Order album. Rather than attempting to return this CD (it was a used purchase) and let some other poor sap pick it up and continue the cycle of disappointment, I threw it in the back of my car, where it fell under the seat and remained for over a year, occasionally enjoying the company of a gum wrapper or spare change. I knew that the quality of a band's output has some ebb and flow, but I didn't want this sound to taint my love of the Entertainment! album. Although I realized at the time that this CD had two albums on it, I naively figured that whoever put the package together would have put the better album first. Thus, if Hard was placed at the beginning, then I didn't even want to bear witness to the supposed horrors that would have been lying in wait for me on Solid Gold . . . what a foolish mistake. Last week, I found that CD under the seat in my car and decided to give it another try. Sure enough, the first few tracks of Hard sounded just as miserable as I remembered, but when I skipped ahead to track 10, "Paralysed," the first track on the Solid Gold album, I found the Gang of Four I knew and loved. Here was the next logical progression after Entertainment!, from the original lineup featuring Andy Gill on guitar and vocals, John King on melodica, Hugo Burnham on drums, and Dave Allen on bass. Even artier and weirder than its predecessor, Solid Gold had everything I wanted from this band, pushing the formula to newer and greater places. Taking cues more from Entertainment! tracks like "Anthrax" and "Not Great Men," as opposed to more melodic numbers like "Return the Gift" (great song), "I Found that Essence Rare," and "Glass," Solid Gold is what a sophomore release from a band should be. Describing why I like Solid Gold is a bit of a challenge . . . it's somewhat of an indescribable aesthetic, but if you listen to the way Gill scrapes his guitar strings at the end of "Cheeseburger," the Burnham's stuttered beats on songs like "What We All Want," the unbridled energy of "Outside the Trains Don't Run on Time," King's direct, often staccato vocals and liberal use of the melodica, the interplay between the bass and drums, or the way each song picks you up, then you'll get it. If you liked aspects of Entertainment! that pushed the envelope a bit, you should get it too. Also, the lyrics are still great, continuing to touch on themes like urban alienation, the slavery of work, social politics, gender issues, and a general confusion/obsession with the inner workings and failings of human social interaction. As many others have already astutely observed, countless bands that owe a debt of gratitude and maybe even a few royalties to the sound that Gang of Four forged on Entertainment! and Solid Gold. There's a whole slew of newer, soon to be forgotten bands that carry the Gang of Four influence like a badge; the earlier (and better) Rapture albums certainly borrow a bit from G.o.4., and of course we currently see many other Anglo-beat bands that ride that trend as well. The best of the batch, with the longest potential, Q and Not U from Washington D.C., have developed a sound that bears many similarities as well, especially when they use the melodica. Indeed, there's plenty of others, too many to list, who don't necessarily fall into this niche, but borrow certain aspects of the G.o.4 sound and approach-the Minutemen, Mission of Burma, and Fugazi, to name a few. Anyways, what are you still reading this for? Get out there, pick up a copy of Hard/Solid Gold, immediately skip to track 10, and enjoy! 
Received CD in excellent conditon and very quick. thank you 
This movie was only ok for me but the soundtrack stuck out in my mind as really great. I was totally excited to see that when I bought this c.d. from Amazon it was inexpensive and even better than I remember. I love Stephen Trask. Many other good artists as well. One of my favorite albums right now 
Well you can't say a lot about the bunch of oldies, they're just great but i didn't buy the album for that. I bought it just to hear "The Trapeze Swinger" by Iron and Wine over and over again, just a couple of minutes hearing it at the end of the movie while leaving the theater was enough for me to fall in love with that song. I've never liked slow songs but for the times i feel sad, but this song just makes my eyes wet everytime i listen it. Just give it a try, it's worth, i promise 
All of these songs I loved in the movie and make for a great collection of songs. Iron Wine are brilliant and add an element to the movie heard in this soundtrack that I do not think any other performer could have done. Trapeze Swinger is my favorite 
Though the overall feel to the album is mellow (namely due to Iron and Wine contributions), every now and then a song that one wouldn't think would mix well with the others actually adds a great layer to the soundtrack. Though it is true that a few powerful songs are missing from the soundtrack (the lost star goes out to them), the group of songs still make a powerful album. The mood ranges from whimsical, sensual, playful, nostalgic, meloncholy and energetic-- quite a range to cover, yet the execution is done through a fabulous selection of artists. A few newer artists are thrown in (like Iron and Wine), some obscure ones (who exactly is Stephen Trask?) and some classics as well (Steelie Dan). The selection of artists leaves all of the generations satisfied and feeling pretty relaxed come the last track. In most cases, soundtracks compliment the movie. In the case of "In Good Company," however, the soundtrack demands more attention than the theme and for good reason-- the soundtrack is done exceptionally well, following no conventional genre or particular mood. Nicely done. 
This soundtrack released does not do the soundtrack of the movie justice. There are too many terrific songs missing. Who needs the instrumental stuff. We want the real songs with vocal artists. If a sample is good enough for you then this will do. It is not for me 
Having seen the film and enjoyed the soundtrack, apart from one irritating song all the other tracks are of the highest standard and I have played it again and again only using the 'skip' buton once each time! 
I liked the movie and love the soundtrack. There are some good oldies and some of artists I've never heard of but like as well 
This soundtrack does it for me. It's entrancing. "Tapeeze Swinger" is so beautiful! And this is the only album on which I could find it. The other Iron Wine songs are great too. I could just zone out to this soundtrack; it's so relaxing. And peter Gabriel rocks! I don't particularly care for the instrumentals by Stephen Trask, and it's missing "Cannonball" too, which is a travesty, I agree, but other than that, it's a must-have movie soundtrack 
I would have put a higher rating but there are not a single shins track or damien rice's (cannonball,how could they?!...).Nice to listen to when you are exhausted and want to rest a while on your bed,chair,sofa,etc...Love the iron and wine tracks,specially the one from the end credit,so beautiful...the movie is nice to 
Stephin Merritt's evocative score for Eban and Charley is a musique concrete version of his others projects (Magnetic Fields, The 6ths, etc.). The instrumentals are tinkling, childlike backdrops incorporating the sounds of crickets, music boxes, toy pianos, rain storms, etc., fitting for a film about the relationship between a 29-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy. The lyrical songs feature a muted version of Merritt's grand irony and romanticism - again, in keeping with the film's clear-eyed depiction of its touchy subject matter. Whether or not the relationship in the film is consummated, the longing in these songs is palpable, painful. Merritt's dry croak of a singing style - an old man's voice married to a young man's idealistic view of love - is creepy in this context, and all the more convincing for it 
This soundtrack has one track that I don't particularly care for. Out of 23. This is probably one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Heaven's Not Enough - Excellent song. It stays quiet for the first two and a half minutes, making it seem very peaceful. Then, it crescendoes into the main piece of the song. It's one of those things where you can close your eyes and feel utterly relaxed. Just amazing. Shiro, Long Tails - This is Shiro from OST 1, but extended. The extension is worth it. It is a very natural extension of the piece, taking it away from the same melody that we have heard for the entire song, yet it does not lose the dramatic essence of the piece. Cycle - Don't listen to this one very often, but a very cool song. The instrumentation and vocals blend together very well, and the chorus is particularly good. Beyond Me - One of the saddest pieces in the show, especially if you recognize the scenes in which this music plays. The lone guitar starts it until they add in a strings section, making for a beautiful piece. Mouth on Fire - Love it. I love the total percussion at the beginning of the song. Then they have a great melody solo before they bring in the full orchestra. It makes for a very cool song that doesn't move fast or slow. It moves at just the right pace. Hounds - A very peaceful, cool tune. I call it a tune because it almost plays out like a jazz tune. It's very cool. And the flute in the song at about a minute in is the highlight of the song. Rain of Blossom - The only one I don't really like. It just doesn't fit with the show. Now I don't remember the song, but it's just very odd and happy, not something that would normally be Wolf's Rain. Separated - A beautiful piece. It is a lone guitar playing melody with strings in the background playing harmony. Very beautiful, if a bit long. Not as sad as Beyond Me, but it is a sad piece. Escape - A personal favorite. Extremely fast-paced, it is aptly named. In the middle of the song, there is a pause, and you wonder if the song is over. Then it comes back in full force, making for a fast and intense piece. Face On - A dark piece, this song incorporates some modern elements, then brings in a strings section. The combination is extremely interesting and quite well done. Tsume No Suna - I don't listen to this one very often, but it's a cool tune. It is probably the most modern instrumental song of the soundtrack, mainly incorporating techno-style elements and not using much orchestral stuff. Flying To You - A nice song, it is fairly peaceful and quiet, a good respite in the soundtrack after the last three fast songs. One thing that is very interesting is the sunthesized glisses that constantly go up and down throughout the whole song. Night Owl - A creepy song, this one makes you want to look over your shoulder to see if someone's there. It has that creepy feeling that makes you uncomfortable, yet it is a very cool tune. There are crescendoes interspersed in it that heighten the creepiness. With each crescendo, a new instrument is put into the mix, making a very interesting song. Forest of Death - The military song of the album, this makes good use of percussion, heightening the intensity and feeling of danger that accompany this song. It is quickly paced and is very good. Indiana - A flute solo, this is a nice song, though not one of my favorites. It is sort of like the song from OST 1 that is basically an old guy chanting most of the time, though I forget the title Amore Amaro - I don't listen to this tune often, but it is very nice, with good piano and vocal instrumentation. It is a very simple song, remaining only a piano and a singer, but it is very good. Friends - The saddest and most beautiful song I have ever heard. This song is worth the price of the soundtrack. A beautiful piano solo to start the song, then incorporating a full orchestra before the final minute which is the same as the beginning, except being a flute solo with a piano playing the bass cleff in the background. This song will make you cry. Tell Me What the Rain Knows - My only complaint with this song is that it is too short. It is an interesting song, being basically the only one to employ a full traditional orchestra along with vocals. Float - Don't listen to this one very often, but it's a very good song. Trace - Very interesting, as it is sad, and yet it is intense at the same time. This music plays in the series when we discover the truth about Hige, so it is very appropriate music and very nice. Sad Moon - One of the better pieces on the soundtrack, it is a fitting penultimate in true Wolf's Rain style, as it is not sad or happy, it is neutral. At the end of the piece, it becomes extremely dark, highlighting the events of the show from the episode. Cloud Nine - A fitting conclusion, I love this song. It is upbeat, not quite on the level of Stray, but still upbeat. It's an enjoyable song, particularly once the vocals start. It also sticks with a modern band, further enhancing its likeness to Stray. Go to Rakuen - I say Cloud 9 is the conclusion because this is a bonus track. It is an extended version of Requiem/Rakuen from OST 1. It is once again beautiful, but the added two minutes only enhance it. Instead of a sad conclusion, it ends on a positive note while still keeping in mind the losses that have been incurred throughout the series. All in all, Wolf's Rain OST 2 is one of the best soundtracks I own. It was a great decision to buy, with a lot of variety. One thing that is very good about this CD is that it doesn't shortchange you like most anime soundtracks do. This CD has more than an hour of music as opposed to the seeminly typical fifty minutes for an anime soundtrack. Well worth whatever price you pay 
I was specifically looking for the song "Friends" when I bought this CD. I now have a shortcut to it on my desktop. After I listened to it enough, some other songs poked my interest. Face On, especially at one moment, made me go crazy. I felt like I wanted to go on an adventure of my own. That was remedied by a few hours of hiking and a CD player with this. Cloud 9 was a real turn off for me. It really sounded like blended J-Pop to me. There wasn't any part of the song that keep me wanting to listen. Cycle is a so-so song, but I feel it could have used something more to make it exciting. That's Yoko Kanno for you, though. She is very open with her style 
I cannot tell you how good this Anime soundtrack is. When I bought this soundtrack, I was really looking forward to just hearing the song "Tell me What the Rain Knows" but then I found out that all these other tracks are also unbelievable. "Cloud 9" is one of the greatest songs ever in this soundtrack, as it really gives you a weird feeling once you listen to it. I also really like Steve Conte's vocals in "Heaven's not Enough." That is truly a great song, yet also a sad song in a way as well. "Cycle" is also a very good song, and the vocals to go along with it are great. And you can't forget "Tell me what the Rain Knows" wither. That is also a great song, but also a very sad song as well. There are also many other tracks on this soundtrack that are truly unbelievable, and many of them will send chills down your spine. Overall, I DEFINENTLY recommend this soundtrack to everyone, even if you're not a Wolf's Rain fan, because in my opinion, this is the greatest Anime soundtrack ever made 
Like the first OST, this is a great Yoko Kanno work. This album has a stronger range of songs than the first album. This could be because it contains more emotion. Where the first is mostly mood music and background stuff, this album has more for emotional building and climax. "Tell Me What the Rain Knows" is bittersweet, Maaya Sakamoto's voice is a beautiful soprano and mixes with the harp and strings very well. It is the beginning of the emotional climax, sad but not a full sadness. "Sad Moon" stands out as the instrumental high point of the album. The strings are sad and faintly evil or slightly depressed. "Heaven's Not Enough" is the one song of the series that pulls you in fully emotionally. The music starts out soft and low and melancholy and the lyrics add in feelings of being lost. Then the drums kick in and the harmonizing and you're caught in a web of sadness. Steve Conte's voice is raw and beautifully melancholy. Call Me is a song from Cowboy Bebop where his voice pushes the song beyond average 
I simply cannot get enough of Yoko Kanno. So far, the Wolf's Rain soundtracks are my favorite works by Kanno, because they are diverse, like most of her stuff, and have so much drama and beauty to them, not much unlike the anime series they were written for. I liked the first one, but for some reason this one really blows me away. The orchestra is a little bit bigger, I think. If you don't like orchestra music some of this might bore you, but I think you should give it a chance, because the violins and such simply accentuate Yoko Kanno's song writing technique. This is very emotional music and some of the songs, like the "hidden" track at the end, just seem to hearten you with the passion that must have gone into preforming them. 
I actually like this one better than the first one, mainly because of "Heaven's Not Enough", which I LOVED in the show, in whatever episode it was in. I also really like "Mouth on Fire", "Face On", and "Cloud 9", but the album as a whole is excellent. My only complaints are that it would be nice to have both English and non-kanji translations of the Japanese lyrics, but that would take up more liner note space. Also, what's up with the bonus secret Track 23 
Yes I am a big big big big anime fan and this Wolf's Rain is one of my favorite anime ever beside Rurouni Kenshin. Fairly and taking out that i am a BIG fan of Wolf's Rain; some of my friends had watched few episodes of Wolf's Rain and they all did admit that it got a very great music as great as anime it self. so don't think twice.. Just get it.. only one thing I didn't like much was that "Heaven's not enough" was sung by a guy while in the show it was done - in first episode - by a woman and it was better but its still very nice 
This soundtrack is good but I gave it four stars because to me it is not as good as the first one. At first I really enjoyed the title "Tell me what the Rain Knows" but it is very short, barely over a minute i think, it ends before it really starts and after a while i started skipping it. There are lots of good instrumental music on it which I enjoy more than the actual pieces with lyrics. Overall its pretty good, if you like the series then you should know what you're getting into 
This album has some of the most memorable songs from the Winans to date.This is where Fred Hammond got his start.Their tight vocals with songs full of hope are their best accomplishments 
Good "ole school" Winans...these brothers really know how to get you into praising the Lord and focusing on the goodness of God 
I am a huge fan of the CARS from day one. I tried to like this but can't I was ready to hit the concert too. I just can't. (Easton busted his collar bone so tour cancelled)Yeah Easton is an excellent guitar player. Hawkes too great keyboards. But missing the other 3 guys it just isn't the CARS. The vocals no less. They can be a cover band but no more. Ben Orr had a voice that can not be copied. God rest his soul. Ric is an excellent songwriter. The band was formed by Ocasek and ORR. When Ben died it really was the end. The thought that these guys would even try is very sad. It is like seeing the Beach Boys today. They are not what they once were. 
I can't tell you how many times I heard the groan "Ohhhh...that sounds awful" when co-workers found out that Todd Rundgren and some members of the Cars formed the group "The New Cars". What usually comes to mind is some sub-par group just going out to cash in as much as they can and the quality suffers. Not so with this project I have to say. When I directed my co-workers and friends to this website where they sampled the tune "Not Tonight" and watched the video on YouTube all agreed that it works! All were impressed by how good the band sounds together. Anyway Its a good CD. 
Wow!... If you're a Cars fan, you have to get this. I found this album by accident on Amazon. I almost didn't buy it until I saw the band members. During the late '70s and early '80s, The Cars, Utopia, and The Tubes were among my favorite music choices. I couldn't believe The New Cars had members from each band. Still, I was a little apprehensive. I was concerned that the original music would be altered too much, and the vocals wouldn't be a true representation of the original. However, this album is amazingly true to the original material. Todd Rundgren sings in a slightly lower octave than usual, and he does a great job reproducing Ric Ocasek (or maybe it was Ric trying to sound like Todd). Kasim Sulton is superb on lead vocals of the songs that were originally sung by the late Ben Orr ("Drive" is a perfect example). Sound quality is excellent for a live recording. But it is live, which is never as clean as a studio recording. On the other hand, the raw sound and the extra emphasis on guitar and drums add a great element to the recording ("Candy-O" is a good example). I bought this album with mediocre expectations, but this album is definitely NOT a half-baked attempt at reliving The Cars. The band members are all very accomplished, and they obviously put a lot of effort into this recording. I hope a live DVD is in the works. 
Ric Ocasek doesn't like to tour. Todd Rundgren had some bills to pay and he always liked the Car's music. I really don't care what his reasons were for joining Elliot Easton and Greg Hawkes, as long as it sounded good. I think it bothered me more when Easton played with CCR revisited, but it was the only way that CCR fans could hear their songs live at the time and somehow they sounded good without lead guitarist/singer John Fogerty. I only have two complaints to make about this CD. First, Kasim Sultan is a good singer, but his voice sounds too pretty on "Drive" and it makes it sound like an Air Supply ditty. Second, they could have covered other Rundgren songs better adapted to the Car's sound like "Forget all About It" or "Couldn't I Just Tell You". The new song, "Not Tonight," is a perfect mesh of the original Cars style and Rungren's music, mainly because it sounds like it could have been released on one of his solo albums too. 
I somehow managed to not pickup the original Cars on my musical radar. I guess I heard some of their hits on the radio but never bought their music. So I came to this album as an unbiased listener. I bought it to play on a radio show I produce called the Comeback Cafe. To my surprise I felt; yea this is great rock n roll from the first song to the conclusion of the album. My wife was a big cars fan and she loves it also. Todd Rundgren does a great job on the vocals. This ranks as one of the best comebacks of over 50 that I've played. There are two new songs on the album and one of them is a masterpiece called "Warm." This song should be a smash hit and makes it worth buying the album in itself.I play this album alot and thoroughly enoy it. Everything here is great and I highly recommend it. It made me a New Cars fan 
All I say is wow wow WOW!!! This is one record that breaks so many rules and is so many exceptions that it could have sunk with the weight of so much negativity. I mean, on paper, the NEW Cars looks like a crash test dummy in a car ready to hit a wall. Look at it: 2 original members out of 5 and none were the lead singers or main songwriters, and in Ric Ocasek's, the late Ben Orr's and David Robinson's place are vets Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton and Prairie Prince??? In 999 out of 1000 times, this would suck. Looks like a hybrid cash-in for money, along the lines of Queen with Paul Rodgers (which mostly sucked as I hate Paul Rodgers although Free was OK). And the new Doors (now Riders On The Storm) with the Cult's Ian Astbury on vocals taking over for the departed Jim Morrison is up for debate. I was as skeptical to the point of saying it sucked without even giving the NEW Cars a chance. Well, not only does it work, but it's actually frikking AWESOME and choosing Todd Rundgren as Ric's replacement??? Pretty inspired and a brilliant fit. I mean, nobody else would be able to pull off a stunt like this. The closest I can think of is Audioslave, where Rage Against The Machine replaced the departed Zach De La Rocha with Soundgarden's Chris Cornell and make it work, so much so that they just released their 3rd album this week, "Revelations". Yeah, they still sound like a Rage/Soundgarden hybrid, but are now sounding like a new beast altogether, like a hard rock/soul hybrid, a hard rock band that Beyonce fans would dig. Back to the New Cars. Yes, this venture works partly because Todd sounds like a hybrid of Ric AND Ben, but also their artful powerpop songwriting styles compliment each other. When you think about it, Todd's classic material like "I Saw The Light", "Hello It's Me" and "One Small Victory", songwritingwise, are not much different from the classic Cars tunes, and Todd takes to them naturally. Add Elliot's and Greg's signature styles on guitar and keyboards and unique background harmonies and, my gosh, these sound close enough to the classic Cars sound to pass muster and go beyond mere Karaoke versions. Those airy harmonies are what do the trick. This record, "It's Alive" is a logical first step for the New Cars. Basically, it's a live album, and generally, I'm not big on live albums...I'd rather see the show on video, but this is necessary, as it shows Todd can fit the role, and that his voice and rhythm guitar playing sound good on classic Cars hits like "Just What I Needed" and fan favourites like mine, "Dangerous Type". I love the sound of the new lineup live. It's louder, more rocking and more in your face than the original recordings, which were slicker and possibly more sterile and detached. Don't get me wrong, I love the Cars records, as this detachedness is a cool counterpoint to the sharp writing and singing by Ric, singing and bass playing by Ben and guitar playing of Elliot, BUT it didn't bode well to a live setting, as past tours have proven to be dull and boring. THIS live New Cars record is how the CLASSIC Cars should have sounded live when they played in their heyday, with a nice dose of fun, exuberance and energy. HOWEVER, seeing Ric live in 1997 on his "Troublizing" mini-tour, with Greg on keys, Bad Religion's Brian Baker on lead guitar, Nada Surf's Ira Elliot on drums and Hole's/Smashing Pumpkins' Melissa Auf Der Maur on bass (and she did sing lead vocals on "Drive" wonderfully, but no Billy Corgan), their sound was as loud as this New Cars live album, but still with a cool detachment, not as much energy. The 2 Todd classics are a nice touch, showing this is not just about Elliot's and Greg's legacy, but Todd's too, as he is a bandmember with a brilliant catalogue and past. Just like how, when Audioslave plays live, they do Audioslave tunes but also Rage songs and Soundgarden/Chris solo songs. What seals the deal here though, and the proof that this is no mere nostalgia act, are the 3 new songs, "Not Tonight", "Warm" and "More"...all fresh songwriting collabs between Todd, Elliot and Greg. "Not Tonight" is an instant classic, catchy, direct, punchy and irresistible, a contender for single of the year, 2006, and it's like classic Cars with a twist of Todd. Those harmonies on the bridge seal the deal and make you think, wow The Cars are back...OOPS the New Cars are here I mean, haha, and I am torn which is better, the studio or live version, as both rock. "Warm" is a hypnotic, keyboard-heavy, moody ballad with a gorgeous chorus, and "More" is a Toddish rocker. All nice nice very nice, and makes you anticipate a full-lengther of all new material from the New Cars. One last note, the live version of "Drive", beautifully sung by Kasim Sulton (who knew he had a great voice??) does Ben justice, but now Kasim departed the New Cars to go back with Meat Loaf for his Bat Out Of Hell III album and tour. Kasim, wow, he was in all Todd-led bands and projects like Utopia and Meat Loaf's band, but he was also in Joan Jett The Blackhearts with his drummer partner Thommy Price, and they did a project together in the 80s, Price Sultan, and many other reunions...the dude's been around. Oh and Prairie Prince is a killer drummer...so is Kenny Aronoff, who's played with everybody since being in John Mellencamp's band...Kenny plays drums on the studio version of "Not Tonight" and "More", in case you were wondering. Yes there are purists, and I agree, I can be one of them, but sometimes you have to put those feelings aside and have an open mind to see if something works...you just might enjoy the New Cars, purism be damned...RIP Ben Orr, now pick up the reissue of "The Lace" out on Wounded Bird, woohoo!!! And Elliot's "Change No Change" also on Wounded Bird with those same 5 bonus tracks 
Call a wrecker, this one's a LEMON!! My best friend's high school band sounded better than this menagerie of musicians! Ben and Ric's unique voices blended harmoniously with music like we had never heard before, creating a prototype for many new vehicles, that rode the "New Wave", from the late 70's into the 80's. Classic cars are at their most value when they are all original. You can't build a car in 2006, and call it a '57 Chevy now, can you? This one needs to be driven into oblivion! My sincerest condolences to the family, friends, and bandmates, of Benjamin Orr. 
The NEW CARS release is a classic example of the genius of Todd Rundgren. Todd brings to life the old Cars classic cuts with gritty guitar, thundering bass and vocal realism that takes you back to the early 80's. Jim Katy, T 
Great remake of the Cars great toons and only Todd could do it!!! the vocals and the mixes are fantastic!! 
I first learned of the existence of The New Cars by seeing an ad on VH-1 Classic promoting their summer tour with Blondie. "The New Cars," I said..."whaaa?" So, a quick Google search a visit to the band's official website, where I was greeted by the full video of "Not Tonight," launched me on one of my latest musical obsessions. I was a big fan of Todd Rundgren even before The Cars released their first album, so my discovery that he was now fronting a reformed lineup of the Boston band was a thrill. Todd does an admirable job handling the lead vocals on the classic Cars material (much of it from the above-mentioned first album) and of course does fine renditions of his own "I Saw the Light" "Open My Eyes." What I was most interested in hearing were the new studio tracks; I was NOT disappointed. "Not Tonight" truly sounds like a classic Cars song, right down to the power chorus; it's a great summer radio song. "Warm" is an odd hybridized ballad, sounding a bit like something from Rundgren's "Healing" CD a bit like something from The Cars "Panorama." Meanwhile, "More" sounds as if it could be a lost track from Todd's "Hermit of Mink Hollow." I would not recommend this release if you consider yourself a "purist" of either artist. However, if you enjoy smartly-written, tightly-performed pop-oriented rock music, you could do much worse than to give this disc a spin, while keeping an open mind 
In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs. Now that I've bored you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on 'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not recommended, duh 
with victory records, it seems like the bands and albums they release are either hit or miss (not to mention, how they false advertise with their band comparisons). i would have to say they got a hit with the band "the forecast". after listening to this record, it's not nothing incredibly ground-breaking or new yet i still can't really find anyone to compare them to. i do know that it's a fairly solid record with a fresh/exciting sound. the vocals are duel, with a guy singing most of the notes but the girl shannon sings some of the songs choruses and let me tell you; she can sing! the forecast are starting to get a hype around them, and it's a deserving one. they're talented and they can produce some interesting music in an overcrowded scene. if you like emo/indie rock with a mix of male/female singing check these guys out. i'm sure we'll hear more from these guys in the future 
This album is so great!! I saw a commercial for the album, and "These Lights" became my favorite song without even hearing the whole thing! My favorite songs on it are "Seating Subject to Availability", "Late Night Conversations", and "Exorcise Demons" If you're looking for something good and new, you should get it 
i first heard of this band while checking out victoryrecords.com i watched the these lights video and fell in love. great melodies. great drummer great lyrics, and most of all a very good album unlike anything else on the victory roster. go.buy.enjoy 
i went to a local "concert" hall and they were playing that night and after hearing them live i was glad i spent the money to buy it. it has lots of great guitar and drum parts. shannon, the backup female singer, is another reason i love this band, she is very talented singer and bassiest. with each not blending almost perfectly into the next the album gets better and better 
Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing. She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well. Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding. It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt. So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt. Do the math 
This band is unlike any other on Victory Records. There is no trendy screamo stuff to be found. Instead, The Forecast are more of a throwback to the great indie rock that hasn't been seen since the late nineties. Their hooks are infectious, and the great melodies by the guy/girl vocals will have you singing along to every song in no time! There's also very slight undertones of alt country which blend in quite nicely. I highly reccomend this for fans of Bright Eyes, Rainer Maria, The Anniversary, or just anyone who's sick and tired of all these stupid emo bands and their feigned screaming! Their video is also great which you can see at their site, the-forecast.net. 
To be blunt, this cd is very suprising, and very good. I basically bought it after hearing only two songs (These Lights, and Fade In Fade Out). I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting, but I'm glad that I got it. So take my advice: Get this cd. Put it on, grab a beer, and chill out. Standout tracks include: Seating Subject to Availability, These Lights, Late Night Conversations, and probably my favorite of all the 6 minute Exorcise Demons. 
I had heard about Laurie Berkner's music, but just never purchased any for my daughter. We'll, I'm SO GLAD I finally did! My 3 year old just LOVES LOVES LOVES this music...great sing-a-longs for bath time, and for long car rides! I highly recommend Victor Vito!! FUN, FUN, FUN!! 
We love all of Laurie Berkner's music and Victor Vito is no exception. In fact, this is my daughter's favorite. Not a day goes by that we don't listen to at least one song on this CD. It is very upbeat and my 3-year old loves to sing along to every song. Definitely a great choice for your children or as a gift.  
I tell everyone that Laurie is one of the few children's musical artists that you actually will enjoy listening to over and over and over and over again! Take it from a mom who knows - Laurie's sweet harmonies, clever hooks, varying styles and fun subject matter (including some well delivered classics!) will have you boogieing right along with your little ones. Laurie's a cool mom must 
If I could rate this as less than 1 star I would. This music is TERRIBLE. It would sound better if I picked up a guitar and started singing. And let me tell you, I don't know how to play guitar and I can't carry a tune. Absolutely terrible 
I bought this one at the same time as the dvd.My two year old and I have a 45 minute commute to his childcare facility.We listend to this CD on our way to daycare and on the way home.He acutally will call out "Boots" or "Salsa" when he wants to listen to these specific songs.He is really enjoying this Cd 
I get home from work my girls age 2.5 and 4 ask to listen to Laurie music. And we dance around and act goofy and sing the songs together. They especially liked when I had Dvr'd the move to the music on Noggin! They would watch it over and over and over and dance and dance. "Let's play freeze dance to Laurie music." You can get in some pretty silly poses that way. Let's go swimming let's go swimming.... 
Wow! I bought this CD based on another parent's review. He wasn't kidding about how you go about your day singing the great little tunes. Our family loves "Victor Vito! 
We love this CD - even my grandma has a copy! It's upbeat and fun - it's fun for everyone in the car! 
My wife and I bought this DVD based on seeing Laurie Berkner performing on Jacks Big Music Show on tv. Our Grandaughter loves it. The songs and videos are perfect for small chidren to watch and enjoy. The DVD is well planned and easy to navigate with good sound and picture quality. If you have young children that need entertainment this is a great DVD to purchase for them 
Not only do my children love this CD, but my husband and I do to. The songs are catchy and fun to sing, my 3 year old knows all the words! Laurie Berkner is very talented and entertaining 
This is clearly one of the best collections of Gershwin's ever-lasting musical masterpieces. Rhapsody in Blue is a favorite piece, and the cd contains many songs sung by some of the greatest singers, including Ella Fitzgerald. If you've been searching for the perfect gershwin cd, consider purchasing this particular one 
Generally speaking, former breakfast sausage king Jimmy Dean is a bit more commercial (and bland) a country artist than I tend to go for, but it can't be denied that his breakthrough hit, "Big Bad John" was a catchy little doozy. This disc includes plenty of lesser tunes, many of them, like "The Cajun Queen" and "Little Bitty Big John" were sequel tunes which barely recalled the grandeur of the original. There are also historical songs like the Kennedy-related "PT Boat 109" and corny recitations like "To A Sleeping Beauty" that are very much products of their time (circa 1961-62). This also includes Dean's somewhat peculiar political song, "Dear Ivan," an intriguing recitation tune that seems very sympathetic to the Russians... and this at the height of the Cold War! Honestly, I don't think Dean was a great talent, but he did have a nice string of hits 'way back when... If you want to check out his best material, I'd say this disc is the way to go, since Bear Family releases are always of the highest quality that can be found 
While the CD I previously reviewed was for the Sony budget CD entitled "Big Bad John and Other Fabulous Songs and Tales," this is my review of the Bear Family compilation entitled "Big Bad John." While this CD does have all of the songs on the CD I previously reviewed, this collection does have many of the singles A &amp; B as well as the entire "Big Bad John and Other Fabulous Songs and Tales" album, although unlike the Sony disc, this CD does have the version of the title track that has a lyric that goes "at the bottom of the mine lies one hell of a man, Big John," rather than the lyric "at the bottom of the mine lies a big, big man" that was used on the Sony budget disc of the "Big Bad John..." album and also appears on Sony/Legacy's "Greatest Hits" CD. Because the extra songs on this disc are first rate, it's worth buying this CD if you can afford the cost. This disc only goes up to 1962 while the "Greatest Hits" collection goes up to 1966 and both CD's are a must have as his recordings do have great sound, they both have liner notes and great remastering, while this Bear Family CD does have a discography of songs he recorded in 1961-1962 in the booklet as well. Before I had this disc today, I long had the Sony budget CD which has just as great sound as this import but the extra songs do justify the cost of this disc very well to the point that I gave the Sony budget CD to a local radio station who has been playing the tracks off of the album ever since. A couple of the songs are previously unreleased on LP and they are just great and this disc is recommended to all Jimmy Dean fans who want more than what "Greatest Hits" offers, but "Greatest Hits" offers the basics and nothing else for those who only want the hits or those who are new to his music. This is for the people who are already fans just like myself 
This budget priced CD is a straight reissue of the album from 1961, yet it does have different cover art than the original LP. Every song on this album is a classic which makes this a must buy for your collection 
Excellent album for casual or die hard fans of Richie Hawtin. One of his earlier guises, Fuse is excellent acid/electro. Some of the tracks are primitive versions of some of the best Plastikman beats in the making(this is not a bad thing). Album artwork is by his brother Matthew. Highly recommended!!!!! 
A New DAY - Awesome. I loved it. f.U. - It's pretty good. Dimension Intrusion- This is a really, really good track. Another Time (Revisited) - The best on the CD, by far, IMO. Substance Abuse - This is the best acid techno song I've ever heard. Everything else is only mediocre, but those tracks well make up for the uninspiring rest. 
This is the worst Halloween sound effects CD I have ever heard. Who did this? It's ridiculously awful; I mean, what is that? "Velcome to my house." This is freaking terrible. This won't scare anybody; they'll just be rolling on the floor laughing. How pathetic. 
Everyones needs for Halloween effects are different. I love creating my own "environment" CD's using sound effects from various sources. This CD has some excellant sounds to be used in your own creation. This CD is NOT meant to be played "as is" at your Halloween Haunt. Rather, you need to combine these sounds to make your own special environement. I have been creating my own CDs (that I loop in a CD player) for years and I have enjoyed using this CD the most. Yes, there are several sounds I will never use because they are bad, but not one CD I have purchased contains all sounds that I would use. I just hope that this company makes more sounds avaiable for us Haunters. Get this CD if you like mixing and matching sounds to create your own "mood" for your own haunt 
I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth 
If you're looking for the sound of the original recordings, look to a different CD. 
any song of jimmy deans is great. i wish he would come back and sing. i dont know if anyone remembers but in 1967 i worked at a truck stop and there was a song in the juke box that i think was "when someone mentions your name" i cant find it anywhere. i know he sang it and i just want to hear it again. i wish i could email to jimmy dean but it is all about sausauge. 
There is not one song that Jimmy Dean sings that I haven't tried to get one of, There is a christmas song, I heard about his mom he did and have never been able to find since I don't know the title. He is a great entertainer I know the sausage is good, but wish he would get back into music, and would love to see him do some TV. His shows were just great. Would love for him to know how insprirational and wonderful his talent really is.I am a 61 year old grandmother, who wish's my grandchildren could always love and relate to these songs as I have.These are the kind of songs that have so much meaning,as was Walter Brenhan,and just recently have had the pleasure to enjoy once again Jody Miller. !Would recomend this music to anyone 5 stars 
i cannot believe i let the Ramones fall by the wayside all these years i was into anything punk rock/anything good. when i used to think "Ramones" i used to think Blitzkrieg bop and i wanna be sedated and how they were so overplayed, so i just kind of disregarded the band with naivety. now recently, i had picked up this album just because i wanted a cd and luckily i couldnt afford anything else besides this moderately priced album and when i listened, i instantly knew i had to have them all! the whole album is great and gets plenty of listening time. i really dont know what else to say besides the fact that we need them in today's music scene more than ever. even if they were just the wise rock n roll sages that stood for something. shame that the all of the main guys died within 4 years. RIP Johnny, Joey, Dee De 
OK, I know I'm slow. Still updating my 'vinyl'. This CD is EXCELLENT; even better with the xtra tracks. All Ramones are kickass; and yes, I think the Spector album is great too 
The Ramones were the punk Beach Boys and sung about the same concerns: going to the beach, being alone in your room, wanting girls. This album is one of the seminal punk documents and is a necessary part of anyone's musical collection. Pure pleasure all the way through. I can't recommend it highly enough 
The fat is stripped, the rock is hard and lean and if you close your eyes you can imagine a thousand birds crapping from fear as Johnny Ramone delivers down strum blow after down strum blow on this 3rd release from the band that figured out exactly what to do with rock `n roll. The longest songs on this CD both clock in at 2 minutes and 49 seconds and "Slug" may be the best pop song to have been left off a CD ever. 
At first I thought that their first album was the best one for years. But when I caught wind of this album, I relized that this one kicks much more ass. "Rockaway Beach" and "Cretin Hop" show it's hardcore punk power while "Here Today, Gone Tomarrow" and "Locket Love" show it's soft side. With Joey's cockeny british accent and Johnny's ripping guitar chords, this is a must have for all fans of the band, punk, rock, or just flat out music 
They must have come from another universe, cause no humans could've created such a perfect album 
awsome ramones cd.a great example of real punk rock.there are alot of awsome songs here.highlights are rockaway beach,do u wanna dance,creiten hop,here today gone tommorrow,ect.this was wen music was about good writing,good instroments, and fun songs.now its about looking good,being rich and having 1 song be played 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times a day.just plain awsome rock n roll.ignore mtv stuff cause it sucks.just buy this right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REAL PUNK: the ramones the clash the misfits the sex pistols the distillers green day FAKE PUNK simple plan relient k the click 5 avril lavgine thats just to name a few.stick to real music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This was the third, and final, shot over the bow of rock music by the Ramones. Sadly, it didn't work for their career but it did help change rock music (along with their first two albums). After this, they would just tread water as lesser bands capitalized on their pioneering sound. This is the last great Ramones studio album, although they released some fine live albums and decent studio albums later 
The debut saved rock 'n' roll and is an all around more important album, but when it comes to the songwriting and consistency, this is their best studio offering. In an age of overblown arena rock and overpetentous prog rock, the Ramones kept things simple with their raw and primative style of pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll. Despite the fact that they were totally derrariative, they were completely original at the same time, making them something other than just an oldies band. They took the classic style of early Garage and Surf rock, and played it at a breakneck speed. There wasn't anything else out there quite like what the Bruthas had to offer. Dee Dee Ramone said "Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration, the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five". Some may claim this is looking deeper into songs that really aren't too deep. I disagree. Everybody can relate to sitting around, eating hamburgers for lunch, hoping for better days, and wanting to go out an have a good time on a Friday night. Despite the simplicity of a Ramones song, they manage to speak to bored alienated teens. One of the best punk albums ever, there is so much more to the band than "Blitzerking Bop". Buy the first four studio albums and they amazing "It's Alive" live album (don't get a greatest hits you loser) 
The Ramones were not a punk band. They were a pop-punk band. But thats ok because this album is one of the best ever made. Capitalizing on the sound iggy pop created 8 years earlier, The Ramones made much more upbeat and energetic music than The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The New York Dolls, Iggy Pop, The U.K. Subs and all other punk bands of the 70s and late 60s. If youre looking for a great album go ahead buy this one. If youre looking for a true punk rock experience listen to The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The New York Dolls, The Stooges, The U.K. Subs, G.B.H, Bad Brains, Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys, The Velvet Underground, Crass, The Exploited, The Casualties and many more 
This is wonderful music with great music videos 
This guy today is so underrated it is practically sad how just a few years back he was selling up to 4 million albums per shot with releases like Kickin it Up and Life's a Dance then for some reason around 1999 or 2000 his career started kind of struggling as far as big hits go I really would like to see one of the two new cuts off this collection reach at least the top 10 because John Michael Montgomery is a great singer and his fans have not gone away there all still listening the thing is radio needs to give him a chance. This is very similar to 1997's Greatest Hits but this includes more hits ranging also between 1998 and 2002. Every song is nice to listen to and its real genuine quality not sappy country pop. To bad there was no Beer and Bones on here then it would been even more better but it is a great collection buy it. It is worth it 
This CD is awesome from beginning to end. It has all of his greatest songs here, from "I Love The Way You Love Me" and "Life's A Dance" on his debut to the beautiful ballad from his latest album, "Pictures", called "Til Nothing Comes Between Us". His career has undeservedly struggled the past few years, and radio has practically ingnored him, despite him putting out his best music on "Home To You", "Brand New Me", and "Pictures". I like the two new cuts, "Cool" and "One Day Less". My personal favorites are "I Swear", "The Little Girl", "How Was I To Know", "Home To You", "Angel In My Eyes", "Hold On To Me", and "Til Nothing Comes Between Us". It may be a little heavy on the ballads, but that's what John Michael Montgomery does best. I thought that none of his last three albums sold as well as they should've, and I hope he can revive his struggling career with this awesome set. He's got one fan here who hopes he can. Keep trying, John Michael 
Never heard of Jim Gaffigan but ordered this CD based on the reviews and I'm very glad I did. Just finished listening to the CD for the second time and liked it even more. Looking forward to viewing the DVD but the CD alone was worth the price. 
This was a great purchase. The CD kept me entertained for a long time. It's even better to watch his facial expressions on the DVD, although the DVD is pretty short. I definitely recommend this purchase. This guy is HILARIOUS! 
This is one of the funniest comedians I've ever heard. I would recommend it to everyone 
I love Jim Gaffigan! Some comedians need to be seen to be appreciated, but I think Jim's style works well even if you only listen to the CD. The little asides he puts into his act (like a member of the audience is commenting on his jokes) really crack me up. The guy is very clever and has a great delivery. After buying this CD I looked up his website and found that he was coming to the Improv in my town, so I snatched up tickets to what turned out to be a sold-out show and it was really great. Alot of jokes from this CD, but alot of material not on the CD. I listen to alot of standup on satellite radio and on Comedy Central, and I like alot of the newer comics (Dane Cook, Mike Birbiglia, etc.) but I think Gaffigan has to be my favorite- his humor is a little more universally appealing 
I just received my copy of this album a few days ago and it is really awesome. I was only a little dissapointed, because I thought the DVD also contianed the audio recording from the CD on video. It would have been cool to have that, but oh well. The DVD conatins his half hour comedy central special and 2 short 7 minutes clips of him at a comedy club. 
I can't count the stand-up routines I hear or see and hardly crack a smile. Not so with Jim Gaffigan. Even after repeat listenings, I still laugh out loud many times it's so funny. The jokes and observations are excellent, and his delivery makes it even better. He definitely has his own thing going on. I also own and love his "Last Supper" disc, but this one is kind of a best of Jim, and comes with a DVD as well, so it's a no-brainer. Another hysterical combo is the last disc from Mitch Hedberg. Now that Mitch has past on, Jim is the best comic going from what I've heard. "Doin' My Time" is even better when enjoying a tasty Hot Pocket. 
The CD was pretty funny. I first saw Jim on Comedy Central Presents and I liked him better on TV. On the CD he keeps doing this weird little voice that's supposed to be the audience commenting about him and it gets real old, real fast. Besides that though, I did like it a lot. 
There are a lot of jokes here that you'll start repeating over and over again. You'll probably start saying them to yourself and will come off looking completely insane. Although there is not a lot of material on this CD/DVD, what is here is worth the price because you'll listen to it over and over. A word of caution however: DO NOT DRIVE WHILE LISTENING TO THIS CD. You'll only wind up annoying everyone driving behind you.  Some stand out tracks are the ones about Beauty and Sleep("I stayed to do what?...watch Growing Pains? What was I thinking?") As mentioned by other reviewers Jim has this thing where he pretends to be an audience member. After a joke he'll make a whispered comment as if he were in the audience. I laughed when I read one reviewer didn't give five stars because of the language. On one part of the cd when Jim uses profanity in a joke he whispers right after(playing an audience member)"I didn't know he was going to cuss so much." So funny.  I'm glad they included the DVD as well because the "Future Pope" and "Manatee1" jokes go over a lot better on the DVD than on the cd. If you enjoy humour like Arrested Development or The Daily Show you'll love this CD/DVD 
I first discovered Jim Gaffigan last month while watching him on Conan O'Brien. I've been living in England as US military so I'm not up to date and don't get comedy central. I was laughing so much about a routine he was doing about cake. I decided to buy the CD and when I first got it, I made the mistake of listening to it in the car for the first time. I was laughing so much, I almost crashed! "He's getting paler" Buy this CD 
The Jazz-Rock fusion movement of the late 70's (Weather Report, Spyro Gyra, Tony Williams) was born on this album. If I could only keep one record in my collection, this would probably be the main contender for that position. This album is a musical safari including a remarkable variety of musical idioms in a Blues context that goes way beyond Blues. Obviously, the East-West track is the pinnacle of this exploration. Listen closely and you will hear East Indian, Calypso, New Orleans Jazz, Bluegrass, and 4 or 5 other distinct musical styles each in a separate movement with very striking transitions. When I first got this album as a sophmore in college in 1966, I used to put on the East-West title track in the late afternoon and drift off into a wonderful, dreamy nap carried off in a magical concoction of World music as I think no one had ever heard before. This is just a glorious masterpiece, a high-point in American popular music. It feels as good today to listen to it as it did in 1966. Oh, aspiring blues guitarists would be wise to try to copy Mike Bloomfield's delicate, complex and powerful solo on "I've Got A Mind to Give up Living." I wore out my vinyl copy trying 
Simply, It's The Greatest Album of All Time. Ciao, /jtm 
In my opinion there has never been a finer blues band than Paul Butterfield. I had East-West back when it first came out on vinyl and now (finally) have it on CD. If you can find a better blues track than East-West, buy it. If you haven't heard it, treat yourself. 
There are many albums which have introduced a new combined style of music to the masses (e.g. "Are You Experienced", "Sargent Peppers", "Johnny Winter" and "Texas Flood" are some). This set was way ahead of its time. The Butterfield Blues Band had made a name for itself on their first, self-titled, LP as great exponents of the revived Blues Power. The edge this band had was, say unlike Canned Heat, they had two Black musicians from Howlin Wolf's band. Sam Lay, the drummer, is still considered to be one the best Chicago Blues drummers ever and bassist Jerome Arnold. This lineup was impressive. Unlike John Mayall, whose album fired interest in the Blues from the far side of the Atlantic with its pre-Hendrix like overdriven sound and up front guitar. However, the PBBB had people from Chicago, the home of urban blues, who had grown up and played with all the greats. Butterfield, originally a flutist, is probably, along with Charlie Musselwhite, the greatest ever white harp player-his style of single note playing (listen to the record) is very unique and gives it a true horn sound. He had met Elvin Bishop at the University of Chicago and started jamming. Bishop, a native Oklahoman, was a Blues fanatic from the start. He played traditional blues styles on his Gibson 335 in the Freddie King, Eddie Taylor, Luther Tucker and Otis Rush tradition. Mike Bloomfield, whose father owned a club in Chicago, had only been playing about 10 years when he made this record. He played jazz, blues and fingerpicking styles well. Mike took up slide on a Fender Telecaster and became known around town for his fabluous technqiue-similar to Elmore James. He was hired to play slide in the initial album on "Shake Your Moneymaker" and joined the band. (However, he was in and out the whole time-I saw the PBBB several times growing up in NY and Bloomfield was never in the line up). On East-West Bloomfield switched to the Gibson Les Paul (Like Clapton) and history was made. His lines are clear and many of his runs are virtually seamless. And amazing effort-one he himself never duplicated- like Eric Clapton on the Bluesbreakers first LP. Mark Naftalin does a great job on the keyboards. And Jerome Arnold plays bass with soul (especially notice his work on "The Work Song" similar to Duck Dunn of the MGs). This band was interracial, a great thing for the Blues Revival that they helped start (Like SRV in the 1980s). They were the Blues Booker T and the MGs. This set combines all genres of music but basically shows the world what Willie Dixon always said "The Blues is the Roots, Everything else is the Fruits!". They do impressive and updated (at the time) versions of many types of tunes. "Walking Blues" is of course a Robert Johnson tune and was probably done because Clapton had done "Ramblin On My Mind" on the Mayall LP. "Mary, Mary" was a tune by the Monkees!!!!!!Can you believe it! "I Got A Mind To Give Up Living" was a B.B. King tune (redone many times with many different titles). Which to me always has been the highlight of the record. It's a blues, but a new wave type of feel and arrangement. Butterfield sings, but plays no harp! Bloomfield produced his best ever blues solos- slightly understated and perfect, especially the intro. "Two Trains Running" has a funky feel and is nothing like Muddy Waters original or the Danny Kalb and the Blues Project's slow version on "Projections". This one rocks and the intro to the guitar solo is fantastic with its tension and build up. The title track is no less interesting. It featured ragas from India with a basic jazz background. Bloomfield and Butterfield's playing is fantastic and highly original. This was the start of the Grateful Dead style psychedelic rock that came in the late 60s. (I can remember playing in bands in 1967 where we did "Gloria" and "Light My Fire" for a half hour each!!!) This track was 13 minutes long and a milestone for the time- the Door's The End was 11 minutes! The Work Song is a powerful jazz-fusion number that has Bloomfield's best solos ever. This was someone at the height of their creative powers. The whole tune is solid and explores the jazz potential of the basic blues pentatonic scale. I feel this was Butterfield's instrumental masterpiece. It is unfortunate that the Blues gave way to soul and country in the 1970s. Butterfield's subsequent work (although some was excellent) never sold well (Like Mayall's as well) and he and Bloomfield had drug addictions which killed them both. Bishop continues to play and had chart success in the seventies. Naftalin played with Otis Rush and others and Sam Lay is still a Chicago institution (see him on the Howlin Wolf DVD and The Fathers and Sons DVD in the Blues series, 2003). This is an essential recording in the history of American Music and should be in everyone's collection. 
Yes, this is the great PBBB's 2nd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying. This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered. The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 1st album) is the one to get. It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001. Ditto for "Pigboy Crabshaw" "In My Own Dream"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not. Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery. Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports 
The title track, East-West, is one of the best rock songs ever recorded. It's a different level than the rest of the songs on the CD, which contain some excellent blues/rock numbers. Very few people seem to 'get' what I call the sub-theme, you need to listen to it in the proper frame of mind. Unfortuneately, you probably also need to be at least 50 yrs old to have absorbed the background needed - many of the cues come from 1950s/1960s TV 
If you like a cd that can get you dancing and hyped up, then this the one! Know matter how old it gets it will still make you want to dance and act a fool. The music is great and some of the lyrics actually make since. My favorite is Throw it up! It's a great song to listen to while playing dominoes and saying "quarterhorse 
I don't lil jon is the king of crunk, that belongs to Three 6 Mafia but oh well. People hate this album because he does not rhyme, they haven't relized he does not do they rappin he makes hot choruses and hooks and leaves the guests to rap. This album is all party music not legitament rap. get this if you wanna have fun and party if you lookin for lyrics this ain't it. best songs are I Don't Give a F***, Rep Yo City, BME Click, Knockin Heads Off, and Throw It Up. 
Well first and foremost, i'm from the south( Alabama that is ) and I really can say this is one of the albums that put the south where we at now. I'm not saying this is the greatest or one of the greatest albums lyrically but at the same time 95% of the songs on this album is catchy. People hate on the south because of what we bring to the table. Thats pure realness. I see a lot of comments about we're too crunk or theres no lyrics, well, first the whole south is crunk, and if you want lyrics we got other rappers for that, Eightball@ MJG /T.I./ Scarface/ UGK/ Outkast/ Jeezy, anyways these rappers talk about how we doit in the south, not anywhere else, so love it or leave it. And for all you haters out there. If you hate our music so much, stop buying it and playing it in your whips 
Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself? Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine? HELL NO! You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner. When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic. BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME? Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd? This is a complete joke. I'm simply calling it like I see it. Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother. Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does. At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with. If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his "fans" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as "music". Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. 
My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
Not!! Hell, just look at the cover and you can probably get a good idea of how stupid this guy is 
Lil' Jon Is One Of The Best Crunk Rapers, He Got A Great Voice And He Makes A Great Beats, But The Album Still Not Perfect So I Gave Them 4 Stars.Best Songs Are: Throw It Up (Feat. Pastor Troy) Knock Heads Off (Feat. Jadakiss Styles) Get Low Pitbulls Cuban Rideout Rep Yo City (Feat. Bun B, 8 Ball, E-40, Petey Pablo 
I hadn't heard of the Kendall's in years and not ever for gospel. This is a great album. Brings back the old sounds of Heaven Is Just A Sin Away 
I have no idea why the record company is not pushing these guys... This CD is one of the best pieces of work in 5 or more years. "Rectifier" "Sky" and I like "Fallen Rock Zone" myself. The Music is very different, almost erie. These guys are real musicians. That is very rare in alot of modern music 
This one the best albums that I own.My personal favorite songs on here are Do you call my name,Rectifier,Skorn and Fallen Rock Zone.This is also one best over all bands,they show that it is possible to make a killer album without having to scream bloody murder or where the album needs a P.A label.So if your looking for a an awesome album thats worth your money this would definetly be it 
A friend of mine intoduced RA to me with a quote from "Walking and Thinking." I'd never even heard of RA and I was intrigued by it: "Lost In A Maze So Very Dark, And Overwhelming, Lost In These Thoughts That Seem To Rule My Mind." After listening to that one song, I ordered "From One" and "Duality." "From One" is another of those MUST HAVES for any Rock fan. Every song is well written, and the compositions range in intensity, composition, and tempo keeping it very interseting. Vocals are great as well, you can actually understand what these fellas are saying, instead of the more common screaming. Anyone can scream, but can you harmonize with the tracks; Now that is the Question. Over the years I have collected over 600 Rock-Metal-Punk CDs, and this one is what I would consider one of my top 25 picks!!! Buy it; RA.......ROCKS!!! 
I have listened to this CD a few times and love parts of it. But first I have to address something... regarding the "Fallen Rock Zone" lyrics, why would these dissuade anyone from listening to the CD? The song is not in favor of pedophiles in any way. Are you just scared because they say masterbater? Seriously. I love the first half of this CD because it's pumped up and fast paced. The second half is more of a downer. The singer is very good with his voice, and its more high pitched (he's like an alto) , like in The Mars Volta. The difference here is that I can stand Ra, but not TMV. I became interested in this band when I heard "rectifier" on Chronix Radio (internet via shoutcast). As for flaws, I think they just repeat too many lines. Come up with some more lyrics! Yes, I like rectifier, but he says "rectifier" like 20 times during it. This makes for songs with less shelf life because you get tired of them. Anyway, I do really like this CD because it seems to be something you can listen to with anyone. I'd rather pull this out than In Flames, Opeth, or Trivium when I'm with someone I don't know too well. Much more accessible music. Enjoy 
Contrary to belief, RA is not a new band. This isn't even their first CD, however, it is their first widely noticed CD. This band has been out (or at least heard of ) since 1999, their first single release was "Crazy Little Voices" with the only track with the same name. Their Next album was "One" released in 2001 which contains most of the tracks that are indeed on this CD except two which are called "End of Days" and "What I am." 2002 is when the band actually got noticed by a lot of people with their CD "From One," which what I am going to review below. Their next single release was titled "Rectifier" in 2003 which contained the FROM ONE single of the same name. They have recently released their latest Album "Duality" in 2005. At first I was a bit weary of keeping FROM ONE upon reading the lyrics. My only aim of buying this CD was in fact to listen to tracks "Do you call my name" -- "Rectifier" -- and "Sky." So when I listened to the rest of the CD I was a thrown off completely. My initial line of thought was "I have gone and got ripped off again by a band that borderlines the Evanescence syndrome!" I was upset to say the least. But upon the third day of listening most of the CD began to grow on me thus becoming less offensive and more enjoyable. However, while Ra is not a great "Nu Metal" band as everyone likes to call whatever this trend is, they are better than most of the stuff that's out there nowadays (Trapt - Shinedown - Chevelle, etc). Their songs have actual lyrics (See Breaking Point and Mad At Gravity's first CDs for more actual lyrics) reflecting the supernatural sense and the "Serial Killer/Murderer/Stalker" type, which is what made me weary of keeping their CD in the first place. The overall best part of the band Ra are their song's great chorus' and the vocalizing. [THE GOOD MUSIC]: 1. - Do You Call My Name: This is what introduced me to this band in the first place. I had heard the Radio Edit on a Rock Station (98 Rock) and was completely blown away for lack of a better word. But the uncut version of this song is far better; the vocalizing by singer Sahaj is very nice, the guitar rifts to tend to drag on a bit after the second repeat of the chorus. 4/5 2. - Rectifier: This is my second favorite song on this CD, and yet another song I heard on the Radio (98 Rock). The lyrics for this song are very moving and do make a lot of sense for the most part, though the "Don't, Don't your dare" verse sounds like a filler 'cause they ran out things to with "Why Don't you care?" The uncut version is far better, giving this great song more longevity 5/5 6. - Violator: The guitars and the vocalizing are the best part of this song. And while the lyrics at the beginning and end (which sorta remind me of a person choosing between wrong and right through confusion) are jamming material, they really don't hold up to the guitar at the beginning. Its the best! 4/5 7. - I Believe: Third favorite song next to "Rectifier," Lyrics wise. "But you won't let go, because your always right, and you won't say no, so you die tonight." The best part of the song honestly, this song rocks! 5/5 9. High Sensitivity: Fourth favorite song next to "Rectifier" and "I believe." The lyrics are not the greatest but the chorus is cool. "High sensitivity, Wake up with my head still aching, High sensitivity, I'm drugged from all the pills I'm taking." The Jamming factor on this song is high and the short lived vocals at the end of the song is sweet! 5/5 12. - Sky: My absolute favorite song on this entire CD. It describes the "Supernatural Sense" I mentioned earlier (Rectifier also has this sense). The Lyrics are by far the most moving and it has the best hard rock tune, probably because Singer Sahaj collaborated with someone else on this song. Overall this is the best song on the CD, however, it does get older quicker than the others do, but this setback shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying this song. I didn't for me. 5/5 [The not so great music]: 5. - On My Side: An overall broody song, not my favorite song, but its entertaining - moving and the chorus is the best part of the song: "If only the sun would take me, If only the wind was on my side." 3/5 8. - Parole: The song's title itself is self explanatory. The lyrics describe a recently released Jailbird and crazy ex-boyfriend hunting down his girlfriend for one simple reason: To get revenge for some apparent reason. The song's lyrics are the very reason I was weary of keeping this CD in the first place. And despite the creepy "murderer" lyrics the hard rock guitar throughout the song are the best part in all honesty. 3/5 10. - Skorn: A very boring song, that really didn't have anything going for it. The "Dear John" beginning made me laugh just one time, then it wasn't funny anymore. 1/5 11. - Walking and Thinking: I honestly thought the lyrics were corny and bland, especially the chorus: "Over the hills, the light, it flows... It shows the angels laughing, And where is the love that we're supposed to find? Lost in a maze of games so very dark and overwhelming, Lost in these thoughts that seem to rule my mind." I really couldn't get into the song at all, plus it was too slow for my liking. 2/5 3. - Fallen Rock Zone: This is this the creepiest song on the entire track. A pedophile creeping the bushes, preying on little girls. I couldn't even listen to the entire song upon hearing these lyrics (or something in that order). I felt really uncomfortable listening to this song. Not recommended listening. 1/5 4. - Only: Another song that slightly reflects "Parole", "Skorn", and "Fallen Rock Zone." Only this song was very boring and not so much as interesting as "Parole's" guitar rifts were. All in all this just was corny as "Walking and Thinking." Boring overall. 2/5 All in all, "From One" is not a CD that will please everyone, in fact a lot of people dislike this CD and seem to favor their fourth CD "Duality" overall, but I haven't heard the Duality CD so I can't qoute. But I can say if you like lyrical Rock music that isn't corny (for the most part), Ra's FROM ONE CD should do you some good. Other than that, stick to the other "Nu Metal" (What the heck is Nu Metal?) bands that floating around. I highly recommend Breaking Point's "Coming of Age." ------ [a 4 out of 5 
This CD is a must have for anyone that knows what musicianship is. So much of the newer music sounds the same. This is not the case with this CD. It has an originality that you have to appreciate. The vocals are unique and fine tuned. The band just rocks. If you get a chance to see them live do. They won't disappoint you at all 
When I first bought this CD, I have to admit that I just bought it because I thought the cover artwork was kinda cool. I buy music on the spur of the moment am always kinda hoping that I can find the salvation of rock music. I think I found it. This CD is a awkwardly experimantal blend of rytham and feeling. The vocalist is very expressive and the guitar riffs are amazing. The bass player is audible (which doesn't happen too often any more) and there are guitar solos. Guitar solos! That's almost unheard of in metal anymore. (...) Anyways, the tracks progress in a very melodic method with a flow and purpose. They are as follows: 1. Do you Call My Name: the opening of the album rates a 4/5. 2. Rectifier: The second track calls for change and a 5/5. 3. Fallen Rock Zone: Weird and interesting lyrics. Good music though, but the song still rates only a 2/5 4. Only: One of my favorites about losing control of yourself after a terrible end of a relationship and/or friendship. Gets an overall 5/5 5. On My Side: song about being alone with no one to care and no way out. Music and lyrics are both excellent and get another 5/5 for Ra. 6. Violater: this song is okay. Gets a 3/5 7. I Believe: Song about religous convictions and the way the world should be. Good song deserving a 4/5. 8. Parole: Violent song about bleeding your ex after you get out of prison. really messed up and only gets a 1/5. 9. High Sensitivity: an okay track. Gets a 3/5. 10. Skorn: A song about the pain you feel after someone you love leaves and didn't feel the way you thought they did. Also covers the anger felt in this situation. Excellent music and lyrics deserving a 5/5. 11. Walking and Thinking: This song is pretty much a spacer between Skorn and the last track. Isn't the best but still gets a 3/5. 12. Sky: This is it. The one that stands out above the rest. The song of the album. This one is my personal favorite. It is musically amazing. It is lyrically moving. The vocal sound is very painfully amazing. If possible I would give this song a 10/5 but I can only give it a 5/5. There's my report on Ra's From One. If you like it then you're gonna be really disappointed with their second album Duality. But anyway, this one is amazing. Pick it up and at least try it out. If you don't like it send it to me because one of my friends scraped (not scratched, but scraped) the CD and it doesn't play the good songs at the end anymore. Anyways, these guys are also good live so go see them. I want to know if this review helped you at all. See ya. 
Okay, first off, don't pay attention to the negative reviews regarding this band. Chances are, they either didn't understand that this band wasn't in their preferred genre of music or they're just unhappy people in general and feel like dropping the hatred on whatever they can. If you have an affinity for music... GOOD MUSIC... then you owe it to yourself to check these guys out. Hey, no one's twisting your arm here, but if you base your opinion on hearing these guys off of the negatives, then you're missing out something fierce. This is simply some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. This is coming from someone who likes everything from Seal to Enigma to Rush to Sevendust/Meshuggah/Mudvayne, Silverchair, The Sundays, Yanni, etc. etc. Let the music SPEAK FOR ITSELF, not the negative reviews. If this isn't enough, go check them out at http://www.raband.net and http://www.rafans.net/ and get an even more in-depth view of the guys. If you make a purchase on 2 cds during the next year, MAKE IT FROM ONE and DUALITY! 
A buddy at work came in and said I have to listen to a song he heard at a strip club. The first track "Do you call my Name" caught my interest and with a few listens I loved it. Excellent track to begin a journey through a strong cd. "Falling Rock Zone" "Only" are back to back tracks that play awesome. I love the arrangement of the tracks and the cd's edge. With the release of their second CD "Duality" they are getting much deserved air time but in my opinion lost their edge and turned 100% pop. Oh Well, it doesn't take away from their debut 
Usually, I don't waste my time reviewing something I can't stand. If I don't like it, fine, I'll keep it to myself. This situation, however, is a little different. I fell in love with Ra's music after stumbling upon their 05' release "duality" a couple months ago. That record was the perfect blend of hard/soft/unique rock with awesome vocals. Think Breaking Point meets Revis, and you have Ra's Duality. I was at best buy the other day to pick up the new SoCo side-project "everything in transit" when i came across "from one". Honestly, I didn't even know they had a past release until then. So, I got it thinking it would be just as good. It wasn't even close. First of all, the mixing and production is terrible and underbudget, and it totally kills the vocal melodies. Next, the songs are way to experimental for my tastes. I can't put up with a song that has no direction for 5+ minutes. Finally, what happened to the chorus'? The Ra I knew before "from one" did an awesome chorus, you know, the kind that make you sing outloud when you're on the freeway or in your room, the kind that make you love the rest of the song, even if the verses suck. Those chorus' are nowhere to be found on "from one". Of the 12 track arrangement, there are 2 or 3 songs I can enjoy, and the rest are terrible. "Fallen Rock Zone" and "Do you call my name" may be the worst songs I've ever heard in my entire life, and I USED to like bowling for soup!!! I'm not saying "duality" was flawless (it had it's moments), but it was something I could listen to over and over again, and really connect with. "from one" is no such album. I want my $10.99 back 
One of the most overlooked bands of all time, the Comsat Angels, made their brilliant debut with the album Waiting For A Miracle. Listening to it takes me back to the fresh spontaneity of live bands of the late 1970s, before music evolved into being over-polished and over-synthesized. It is pure and sparse and (for me) quite enjoyable in 2006. There are some amazing tunes here, especially Missing In Action, Real Story and the Comsats' best known song, Independence Day. As with all of the Renascent re-releases, this one has a number of bonus tracks and slick little booklet which gives the early history of the band and album synopsis. They don't make albums like this anymore. Luckily, they re-release them. Don't pass it up 
I had the pleasure to wander into a concert by the Comsats about the time that Waiting for a Miracle came out. I was working in Greece and visiting a friend in London. It was an afternoon concert at the Lyceum with about 6 groups on the bill. When the Comsats came on, both of us looked at each other with that "these guys are really good, I mean really good" look on our faces. Miracle was sparse and wonderful, followed by the amazing Sleep No More, which is the one I play for friends who have never heard of the Comsats first. Living in Europe I got to see them a few times and socialize with them when they did a (honest) July 4 gig in an outdoor venue in Holland. This is the band that U2 was the opening act for when they were just getting going, and I do hear a lot of the Comsats in U2. Though to my mind, Stephen Fellows has a superior voice. Pity that the band didn't get the kind of success that U2 got, as that would mean they would still be together and turning out amazing music. As I said, Miracle is very sparse and in this day and age may be a bit of an acquired taste. But, I always thought how incredible On The Beach would sound in the hands of a great soul singer with a full wall of sound production. As Stephen Fellows would have said: "See You in the Future" Ja 
If you aren't familiar with this album, imagine a less relentless, subtler Joy Division. This is, in my estimation, the finest, most chilling post-punk record in existance. They don't hit you over the head with existential gloom...they merely snake around it. Fans of early 80's British new-wave ie. Chameleons, Echo and the Bunnymen or The Sound would be doing themselves a tremendous dis-service not owning this albums. Renascent UK has done a wonderful job with the new liner notes. "Sleep No More" may be a "better" album, but I find it a bit too self-consciously dour (but still absolutely brilliant...). All four Renascent UK reissues are requisite as far as I'm conserned, but this is the one I would have to choose if absolutely forced to 
With today's post punk revival, many unknown albums of the 80's are being reissued and reevaluated. The Comsat Angels are more than worthy of this recognition. Its hard to describe Waiting for a Miracle in exact terms. It is obviously inspired by Joy Division or early Echo and the Bunnymen but more slowed down and atmospheric. Think "17 Seconds" era Cure but depressing rather than nihilistic. The band, the Sound has also garnered some attention but the Comsats were more subtle and unnerving. The Comsat Angels were a cult favorite of the time and often toured with U2, who picked up some of their ideas. However, unlike U2, the Comsat Angels are not political. Their world is that of existential dread. Their second album Sleep No More is also worth picking up but eventually they became a derivative new wave band. However, when their ideas were focused as on Waiting for a Miracle, they captured the climate of the times as successfully as other, more famous bands. Get this album before it goes out of print again 
. . . right up there with Omar Sosa's Pictures of Soul and Mulatos, Evyind Kang's Virginal Co Ordinates, Rita Marcotulli's Koine, Wayne Shorter's Alegria, Horace Tapscott's The Dark Tree I and II, Dave Douglas's Witness, and Henri Texier's Mad Nomad(s). If you know anything about me as a reviewer, you know that that is the highest praise I can give a record. One of the things that makes this such a great disc is a strategy leader Hollenbeck employs here and on his two Claudia Quintet recordings--he presents familiar instruments in unlikely settings. The most remarkable instrument on this disc may be the voice of Theo Bleckmann. Ranging from crystalline lyrical renderings ("A Blessing" and "The Music of Life") to simply stunning vocal gymnastics on, for example, "Weiji," Bleckmann always impresses. More proof of Hollenbeck's weirdly savvy use of instrumentation is the vibes/piano duet passage in "RAM"--the way these two percussive instruments dance and interact supported by electric bass and percussion may be unique in the history of recorded music. As with his remarkable disc, I Claudia, Hollenbeck has conceived and set within unique voicings a wide range of instrumentation. Since he's working with a much broader palette of instruments on this disc, his accomplishment is all the more remarkable. Another thing that sets this disc apart is the ease with which Hollenbeck navigates between and among genres. In the course of the startling music represented here, he moves with perfect ease between folkish world-jazz, New Music, classical, chamber jazz, Minimalism, and a sort of post-Mingus morphing big-band jazz--sometimes all at once, as on "Folkmoot." Indeed, this may be the single most eclectic yet cohesive musical concoction ever recorded. I hear everything from Charles Ives-ish heartland dissonance to John Adams-like anthemic moves to Steve Reich-type minimalism to Mingus big-band freak-out. There's also touches of Dave Douglas expressivism, as well as, of all things, a kind of almost neo-Township vibe--one imagines Johnny Dyani and Chris McGregor would feel absolutely at home in this setting, not to mention fellow percussive master Louis Moholo or that great English Township-jazz revivalist group, The Dedication Orchestra. Virtuoso beyond imagining, the present disc under review is always, remarkably, listener-friendly, which is not always the case with such heady, highly conceptualized music. Because of his ability to write for and record with two such diverse ensembles, namely, the Claudia Quintet and this, his Large Ensemble, John Hollenbeck vaults to the very front lines of modern music masters. A Blessing is absolutely mesmerizing, and certainly not to be missed. May well end up being the record of the year, if not the decade 
Back in 1977, Cheap Tricks management wanted to release a cd that would hold them over until the new release was finished. Dream Police was almost ready to roll, but it just needed a little extra time to be fully completed before it was released to the world. Up until now, Cheap Trick had not had much success in North America and they were counting on the Dream Police release to put them on the map. When they recorded Live a Budokan it was to help get things rolling and to be a stop gap measure to fill the void until the new release was ready. It was also only supposed to be released in Japan. Well as it turned out, it was one hell of a stop gap. Live At Budokan became the anthem in North America and broke the band big time. It was a tremendous success that helped propel the band to new heights. Songs like I Want You To Want Me became overnight hits. They had reached massive success almost overnight or least it seemed. Cheap Trick was a hard working band and this over night success so to speak was well earned. Well here we are some 30 years later and this time out we get the complete concert. Yup that's right, uncut from the record label big wigs this time out and in it's entirety. It's amazing that something this old can still sound so fresh and unencumbered. The darn thing still sounds good!!! This release is a tribute to what good rock roll is all about. It just had something about it, a live energy or passion that still holds up today. If you only have one Cheap Trick cd, this is the one you want or need as it's the band at it's best! 
Like The Who, Cheap Trick utterly dominates the stage as a live band. Unlike The Who, however, Cheap Trick has never really put out a truly extraordinary studio album (good albums yes, but not extraordinary). I think these are the reasons why Live at Budokan has always been a favorite of critics and listeners alike. Although I personally have a distaste for CDs that add bonus tracks to classic albums, thereby ruining the atmosphere of the original work, I regard The Complete Concert as a different CD entirely. Because Cheap Trick is a first-class live act, it deserves to have the entire performance documented. The original Live at Budokan, great as it was, always seemed disjointed and incomplete, even though that never detracted from its appeal. This CD brings you the entire show, fills in gaps, answers questions, and really makes me wish I could have been there to witness thousands of lovely Japanese ladies chanting "Bun E, Bun E"! Not all the additional songs on this CD are up to par with the original, abridged Live at Budokan. But that's not the point. The point is that this documents a classic live show in its entirety, and it IS very entertaining from start to finish. When you consider all that stringy hair, Rick Neilson's "quirkiness", and Bun E. Carlos' decidedly non-rock-and-roll-star appearance, you quickly realize how great this band really is to entertain so many people for so many years. Live at Budokan has always been an inspiration to me both as a drummer (Thanks, Bun E!) and as a live musician. The Complete Live at Budokan does nothing to change that. I'm keeping the original Live at Budokan along with this CD, but I for one am thrilled to finally have the entire concert in my collection. 
Cheap Trick is essentially a minor guilty pleasure and a little cheesy, but if you can get past that then you will find that they are an AMAZING band! Their strengths lay in their live performances, and this album especially proves this point (they were more of a "show" than an artistic, political or poetic group, and they knew this). What's so fascinating about "Cheap Trick At Budokan: The Complete Concert" is that it's so well-produced for a live show - you can hear everything clearly! The drums are especially easy and fun to listen to. The songs are all essentially cheesy-but-fun power pop songs with a hard rock twist, and even if they aren't the deepest songs in the world lyrically, you will still probably love them. Not all of the songs here are great, unfortunately (the original album only had 10 songs, but this has about 25 - that could explain it), but the album's length and the amount of good ones it DOES have more than make up for it. "Hello Kiddies", "Big Eyes" and "Surrender", for example, are all classic power pop songs from the early seventies. Singer Robin Zander does an excellent job with the vocals as fits perfectly as a power pop/hard rock vocalist - I'm pretty sure that most people will love him. The lyrics aren't all that interesting by themselves, but Robin definitely adds much needed energy to the mix. Like I said, the only downfall to this particular verson of the album is that some of the extra songs aren't that good (the original album wasn't the whole concert, but this is). Basically, if you're into power pop, the history of rock or if you're looking for an amazing live album, then "Cheap Trick At Budokan: The Complete Concert" is one of the best you buy! Absolutely recommended! Highlights include: "Hello Kiddies" "Come On Come On" "Big Eyes" "Downed" "Surrender" the rest are good or decen 
The "spotlight" reviews above were kind of.... ignorant to the meaning of the Cheap Trick at budokan album. If your interest as a listener is to collect 70's nastalgia in questionable taste, then like the spotlight reviewers above, maybe you should buy this album. But the real reason why "Live At Budokan" is so interesting - seriously - is spelled out pretty clearly on the closing track "Clock Strikes Ten". There music was nothing masterfully special, and Cheap Trick knew that. Just like the latin musicians who never perform without 10 good looking dancing girls on the stage: IT'S JUST A SHOW. Gonna get down, gonna get on down -- they are talking about what they are about to do right after the show is over. Live At Budokan: one of the largest documented orgies in mankind. Sure, orgies go on all day 24 hours a day, what makes it interesting is that "live at budokan" documents it. More power to them, they did it, and the memories are their's to keep. I'm just a creep sleeping in comparison to the fun they had 
This album goes down in the history as one of the greatest live recordings, ever. I recently went to Japan and saw Judas Priest at Budokan (Boo Dough Con, not Boo Duh Con). It was a chilling experience to walk up to this temple like structure...walk inside and imagine what happened inside there in 1978. I was walking back stage in the hallways...and I could imagine Robin Zander warming up vocally...a tinge of nervousness and absolutely no clue what was about to happen. Magic. This CD takes the original to a new level. Cheap Trick is one of the few bands that never really captures in studio, their live sound. This CD captures them at their best.. 
Who out there can't listen to Surrender non-stop???? This is a classic live set 
I'm not usually a big fan of live music, but this album actually blows away a lot of Their studio recordings. The sound is great, and You get the extra cuts that wer'nt available on vinyl back in the day. The energy level is incredible, if You crank it on a nice stereo it's like You're there 
It is usually a rare feat when a band hits it big as a result of a live recording. Normally a band will release a live recording to sustain the momentum of the band without having to record new material. Such was the case in 1978, when Cheap Trick released "Live at Budokan". Cheap Trick hadn't had any major success in the U.S. up until this point - but it was "Live at Budokan" that put them on the map. "Live at Budokan" is a legendary live album. Back in the late 1970s, live albums were very much the "in thing" on the music scene. Some have even gone as far to say that "Live at Budokan" might be one of the greatest live albums in the history of the music business. Regardless on where "Live at Budokan" stands, one can't deny its impact - it was a huge commercial success for Cheap Trick and put them on the map. This CD isn't the 1978 "Live at Budokan" - this is an expanded set called "Cheap Trick - At Budokan: The Complete Concert". It actually is a take of the original Budokan album and 9 of the 12 tracks from a 1993 "Budokan II" album (the 3 remaining songs not included were actually from 1979 - a follow-up tour. As a result, the 2 CD set "Budokan: The Complete Concert" is a much better product than the 1978 album - this due to the inclusion of the "Budokan II" material and the power of digitial remastering.  I think it is appropriate to discuss the liner notes early on. Although there are no lyrics included, the liner notes go into amazing detail of the story of Cheap Trick's performance at the Budokan. For such a legendary live recording, the liner notes do an outstanding job at telling the story. The interesting part is how they went to Japan and never planned on this album being the worldwide success that it turned out to be. Another interesting story is that the original Budokan album featured the songs that were more "pop" in nature and preferred by the Japanese audience. The less pop (or now called these days 'alternative' side of the band) wasn't released until 15 yeas later on "Budokan II". It is also worth noting that this CD does a nice job with the production credits - including a comparision to the 1978 original "Budokan" album.  So if you are new to Cheap Trick - what is the legend of Budokan? For starters, I think Cheap Trick doesn't get a lot of credit as being a bridge from the early 70s sound to the new-wave 80s sound. As a band, they have always been underrated in their careers. You'll hear the old Hendrix-style guitars of Rick Nielson in "Can't Hold On", yet hear the almost altenative type sound in "Elo Kiddies" to the 80s anthem-like rock in "High Rollers". As a result, they were able to come up with a very unique sound. This unique sound translates brilliantly into a live performance. You will feel the full energy of this concert - from the band's standpoint and from the fan's standpoint. There will be times when either: Robin Zander's vocals will shine (such as "I Want You To Want Me"); Tom Petersson's Bass will be in the limelight ("Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace"); Rick Nielson's Guitar will roar (like in "Can't Hold On"); or Bun E. Carlos drums will be as loud as thunder (such as "Elo Kiddies"). The digital remastering even does better to make a 3 dimensional effect with the sound. This is also a full concert. There won't be breaks between the songs - the whole concert flows real nice - from the opening band, to the 2 song encore. Live albums such as Bon Jovi's "One Wild Night" which don't encapsulate a single performance are sorely lacking because they don't have the continous flow. Finally, Robin Zander does a great job at connecting with the audience and this is very evident as you listen to the tracks.  The 2 CD set also features some video footage. The first CD contains the video performance from Budokan of "Auf Wiederschen" while the second CD contains the video performance of "Surrender". The first CD also features a short video interview clip from Bun E. Carlos and Robin Zander, while Rick Nielson and Tom Petersson are on the second CD. The videos can be played on either the Mac or PC. They do use some dated Quicktime technology, but they do get the job done in terms of bringing a visual element to Budakon that wasn't available on the original CD. I kind of wish they included some other videos or even released the DVD or VHS or the Budakon concert. Perhaps that is something to come in due time.  I've heard Cheap Trick live and studio - the live version is the way to go with this band. If you've heard about the legend of Budokan, I'd strongly advise just getting this 2 CD collection - you'll do much better here as opposed to buying the original and the "Budokan II" CD. All of the great things you'll hear about this collection are true and it will become a cornerstone of your collection for years to come 
first off, let me get some things straight with the idiot below me. 1. dntel is jimmy tamborello. not ben gibbard. 2. ben gibbard recorded under ATQ before he ever formed death cab for cutie. he released the tape on elsinor in 99. now, the album is a pleasant listen for fans of gibbard and fans of lo-fi indie pop. broken guitar and a microphone can do wonders when utilised the way gibbard has on this record. in a way, it reminds me of smog, who is one of ben's influences 
I really enjoy this album. I think that is all there is to say! If you are a Deathcab, Postal Service, or general fan of anything Ben Gibbard...you should own this right now. 
All-Time Quarterback! shows what potential your kids could have. Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard plays around with kid instruments and comes up with a warm and charming low-fi masterpiece. Half of this 11-song, 28-minute disc was originally recorded to walkman and many of the songs previously released as part of 1999's All-Time Quarterback! CD-EP and the home-recording cassette-only The Envelope Sessions. As a whole, All-Time Quarterback! has the feel of an album of hidden tracks or studio outtakes. "Plans Get Complex" is simply sing-song with its toy guitar and broken Casio underpinning. The previously unreleased "Dinner At Eight In The Suburbs" and the jaunty "Untitled" sound like early Pet Sounds demos while Gibbard employs a toy piano to seriously alter the mood on his cover of the Magnetic Fields' "Why I Cry." Unfortunately, despite this present collection, Gibbard has hung up the ATQ mantle writing it off as a fun one-off side project. All-Time Quarterback! is a fine example of songs that stand on their own merits, recordings that haven't seen Pro Tools, and a combination of the both into a darn good album 
this is benjamin gibbard of long touted "best band in the nrthwest" death cab for cutie singing by himself and with others, playing songs that come from the heart, the mind, and the little child in all of us...love redemption faith and other emotions so key in life are played here in broad terms and easily digested tidbits....this was orginally released a very very long time ago and was out of print since...but the cool kids at barsuk have decided to give all another crack at it, with the bonus footage being nearly as essential as the older disc....their are two unheard songs and a mini movie that will warm the cockles of any heart....very highly reccomended for those that love the indiepop front and even those who are in love with singer-songwriters with guts and pinnache (john vanderslice, bright eyes, neil halstead, etc)...get this record to mend and to be....whole 
This album showcases Ben Gibbard's song writing prowness and penchance for clever lyrics. Each song reads like a page of a diary, in that Gibbard reveals a little of his personality and his past. Like his main project, Death Cab For Cutie, these songs retain catchy melodies. However, with just a keyboard, a drum set,a guitar, and a track mixer, the sound is very stripped down and raw. As a result, the tracks sound very simplistic compared to the lush orchestration which the DCFC material is known for. Despite the upbeat sounding keyboard chords employed in many of the tracks, the lryics, while excellent remain somewhat downbeat. Although, most tracks deal with past mistakes and self mockery, only Gibbard could write such poetic words. Like other debut solo albums, such as Glen Phillip's, Gibbard's record has a bare, no frills nature that lends its own unique charm. Gibbard's expressive voice oozes sincerity, something rarely seen in even the indie music scene. The live DCFC song, underwater also adds to effort, highlighting the difference in sound between the two groups. Overall, the album provides a raw, but enjoyable trip into the life and mind of a song writing geniuse 
this cd is very, very good, it is awesome every single song os very good i really, really recommend it, i know you'll like it 
This is a great way for Roy Jones to help himself since boxing isn't really doing well. Before this he made some appreances like in Put Yo hood up Remix By Lil Jon and had a cameo in Ain't Got Nothing by David Banner. He helps Magic really crunk This album up. Best Song is I Smoke I Drank Remix. For the price this album is a steal, go out and cop it right now. 
I first heard Body Head Anthem on Midnight Club 3 and thought it was one of the best songs on that game. So I decided to get the RJJ cd and check it out. I'm glad I did. There isn't just one good song, there's a couple. It is straight up bangin and it gets you going. Whoever said RJ can't rap on this album is way off. He brings a lot of fire to this album and the production is off the charts. Joining him is Magic, BG, Juvenile, and Lil Flip. The two best tracks I thought were U Know My Kind and Body Head Anthem. I would go so far to say that they are the most bangin rap songs I've ever heard before. So check this cd out and let Body Head Bangerz hit your speakers full blast. 
Everyone who likes rap in general, hardcore rap, tight beats, and beats that'll get ya goin' - PICK THIs UP! I recommend this CD to rap fans. From Heavyweight Champion to rapper with a great debut CD - Roy Jones Jr. is definitely doin' it big like everyone else has said. I Smoke, I Drank (Remix) is my anthem and my favorite rap song 
This is a very good album. It is worth the money to buy it. But it is so good that when the Bangers put there next out it cannot be met or be as good as this, the first of the albums 
Nice to see Magic back doing his thang. And yes Roy has come a long way. Nice beats and fire lyrics make this a hard one to pass on. Well worth the chips.Its more of a magic album. Magic is on almost every song. Im mad he is not on nl but o well he is still tight!Everybody need to cop this album. They really did it big on this cd.he really needed to since he dont have boxing nomore.i knew tarver would get him BUT johnson? his boxing career almost over. pppppeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh 
im from pensacola, da home of roy jones jr. himself fo thoze who donw know,and he is puttin pcola on da map real big fo sho this cd is real big big down here especially dat i smoke i drank keep doing what u do folk. 6th ave. representin 
THis is a party from intro to outro a total head bobbing cd. With guest appearance by YoungBloodz,Juvenille,Lil Flip. its put together so good it will make you stand up and dance for shure. I smoke,I drank is by far the new antheme for the South. If your down with the Dirty South then pick it up or if your looking for a party album pick it up and dont think twic 
You guys are failing to realize, this CD aint roy jones, its Magic (aka White Eyes (Sorry magic, screw Master P!)) comeback baby. He is better then all these cd's, he even does the chorus for 90% of the songs. Magic you hot. You make the bangers, tear it up! "I smoke, I drank" is actually magics song, from one of his Cd's, but called, "Do It Big", magic makes the BHB'erz... ya heard me?. 
12" dance collectors rejoice. Ben Liebrand has assembled a 3rd volume loaded with full length mixes, tediously mastered (some from vinyl because he couldn't find the original masters, but you really can't tell). Personally, 2 songs that make it extremely worth the price for this 4 disc set for me are the Giorgio Moroder productions: Suzi Lane, and the 12" version of Janis Ian from the Foxes soundtrack. There are also NUMEROUS hard to get 12" versions finally here on CD. Still so many more elusive mixes for Liebrand to include on future volumes, and I hope he'll take note of the request list on his website. Notes and nitpicks are below: CD 1 1 Robert Palmer You're in my System (Extended Album Mix) 06:00 (very rare on CD!) 2 Andrï¿½ Cymone - The Dance Electric 05:35 3 Chas Jankel - Glad To Know You 06:37 4 Suzi Lane - Harmony 06:59 (want the ENTIRE moroder produced album on CD, but this is a start!) 5 Chaplin Band- Madmen's Discoteque 06:30 6 Janis Ian-Fly Too High 06:51 (awesome. Didn't even know there was a 12" version of this track which has only appeared on vinyl in its SHORT version!) 7 Rah Band - Slide 06:39 8 The Real Thing-Can You Feel The Force 07:39 9 Anita Ward - Ring My Bell 08:12 10 Boys Town Gang- Cruisin' The Streets 13:14 (wow.

This song barely cracked the Billboard dance charts, and there are so many other Billy songs that were bigger) 6 Dynasty - I don't wanna be a freak 07:23 7 Herbie Hancock - Tell Everybody 07:50 8 Shalamar - Right In The Socket 06:42 9 Third World - Now That We've Found Love 08:16 (wow. This version is even longer than the 12" version I have) 10 The Commodores - Brickhouse (live) 10:26 (WHY??? A live version of an already overplayed song that can be found in its full length studio version on numerous CDs??? 10 wasted minutes of CD space) CD 4 1 Imagination - Body Talk 06:00 2 Fern Kinney - Groove Me (long version) 08:54 3 One Way with Al Hudson - You Can Do It 07:03 4 David Bowie - Let's Dance 07:39 (another waste of space. There really isn't a 12" version of this song. This is the full length album version which is easily obtainable on Bowie's CD) 5 Fox The Fox - Precious Little Diamond 07:27 6 Fun Fun-Happy Station (original 12") 07:16 7 Tavares - Heaven (Irresistable Angel Mix) 08:35 (2 minutes longer than the original version, but this is DRASTICALLY remixed. It even includes some obnoxious astronaut voice overs at the beginning) 8 Liaison Dangereuses - Los Ninos del Parque 05:01 9 Talk Talk-It's a Shame 07:01 (this is the overseas 12" version.

Yup, here's the one. The best songs of Jose Luis Perales in two CDs. I must tell he's one of the best spanish singer/songwritters. I rememeber that my father used to play his songs in the morning, and I woke up listening to these marvelous compositions. The music came form an old cassete player, but the magic was there. JLP speaks about love without the cheesiness we fit today in most "love songs" This is poetry, and you can feel he's singing from the very heart. His lyrics are simple but memorable and touching. I would to translate some of the verses of "EL amor" El amor es parar el tiempo en un reloj es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz El amor es crear un mundo entre los dos es perdonarme tï¿½ y comprenderte yo Love is like freezing the time on a clock. Finding a place where I can hear your voice, that is love. Creating a new world just for us, that is love. To forgive me and to understand you, that is love. So this is a great compilatory in wich you'll find the most beauty songs written for Jose Luis Perales. Just in case, if you like Jose Luis Perales, check also Camilo Cesto and Julio Iglesias 
Me encanta Perales como compositor y por esto compre este disco pero los nuevos arreglos de sus exitos son basicos y malos. Su primera cancion "Porque te vas" no tiene casi instrumentos y pues a decir verdad su voz no es que sea de las mas bonitas, Parecia mi abuelito cantando. Adoro a Perales pero esta recopilacion es una perdedera de dinero 
BAD went on after this witty, original, melodic, rhythmic release to produce at least two other superb works: Megatop Phoenix and The Globe. Mick Jones is a really creative fellow, with some of Frank Zappa's humor and ability to write a great tune. Wanted to point out - since many reviews refer to the Good/Bad/Ugly sampling - that the dialogue in E=MC2 (you're Jack the Lad...give them a bit of stick) comes from the Nicholas Roeg film Performance, with James Fox, Mick Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, set in 60s London. Jones evokes the Swinging London era quite often; there's a hilarious sequence on The Globe where Cathy MacGowan, or someone like that, is rambling on about dolly birds and with-it clubs 
When this album came out, many people were surprised that Mick Jones had done something so different. Everyone knew he had a more poppy taste than Joe Strummer, and he indulges it here to great effect. At the time, it was one of the first albums I had heard that used sampling on such a large scale. Medicine Show kicks off the album with its samples of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Even my non-music lover husband likes this because he's a big Clint fan. I just love the way the music grooves so mellow and happy under the shootout you hear above! Sony is a classic 80's retelling of the prototypical Japanese worker, at the same job for 40 or 50 years. Of course, at the time, there was a lot of fear economically of the Japanese; however, they were revered in their work habits, inventory control procedures, and quality circles. This song is pretty stereotypical but it's tongue in cheek as well, which is what makes it great. E=mc2 is wonderful! The beat starts in and never lets up the entire 6 minutes of the song. The samples this time are from an English film, "Performance," and are a nice complement to the pulsating beat of the song. And The Bottom Line... "the horses are on the track!" Who can forget that line? What a breath of fresh air in 1985--and a biracial band as well. DJ/filmmaker Don Letts was a driving force in the band and the one behind all the samples. If you like "Inoculated City" from the Clash's Combat Rock, you'll love "This is Big Audio Dynamite." It has the same funky feel and Mick Jones vocals, but a whole album's worth this time 
This is almost exactly what I look for in a sampling-based album - strong vocal, strong song structure, and catchy beats. "This is Big Audio Dynamite" definetely delivers in all aspects - unimaginably catchy, intoxicating beats that really get into your soul. "E=MC2" is now one of my favorite 80s tracks - brilliantly put together with a strong vocal and amazing beat. Why did it take me so long to find such an amazing-sounding album? I thank the wonderful "Listmania" creators on Amazon.com for this amazing discovery. Besides "E=MC2", the best tracks are "Sony" and "The Bottom Line." Download or buy ASAP! 
Big Audio Dynamite's first album has got to be their absolute best. My first exposure to B.A.D. was hearing the song "Bad" in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", and it made me seek out this album. (This was before I was even a big Clash fan, and I later become one.) To my surprise, every single track was just as good as that one, if not better. From the western sampled "Medicine Show" (with clips from "The Good, The Bad The Ugly" and "The Treasure Of Sierra Madre"), the catchy and kitschy "Sony", the dance hit "E=MC2", to the Reggae peppered "A Party", I can't find a track among these 8 songs that isn't good. I highly recommend checking out anything of Big Audio Dynamite that you can get your hands on, but a lot of it is out of print. (The drastically underappreciated F-Punk being one of those) Luckily, the brilliant debut album is still in print, and even though it's still a bit hard to find, you can find it without nearly as much as hassle as some of the other releases. Grab this one 
Mick Jones and Co. never broke that sophmore jinx--they could never top what they did here, on THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE. Employing big sounds and borrowing from their favorite big American icons (especially Clint!), this album showed who was behind the big club tunes of the Clash, like "Rock the Casbah". There is a certain playfulness to Mick Jones' style that fits in with this sound. And of course, timing is everything. Big Audio Dynamite emerged during the big eighties--just like Peter Gabriel's "Big Time", Big Country's "Big Country", all the Talking Heads'/David Byrne "Big" tunes and the Tom Hanks' movie named... you guessed i 
Mick Jones' vocals,as a previous reviewer noted, may be limited.However, they're not the worst. B.A.D. was not an opera group project. Their sound was unique and different with their edgy blend of pop-rock,reggae, some faint punk-ska and various audio samples.There was a definite underlying tone of the Clash (Mick Jones) with a more pop vein geared towards a tamer version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers without crossing into Beastie Boys territory. You have to admire a group of guys who did take experimental bounds and leaps to create a unique and different sound that did not fit the typical new romantic or new wave format drowning the airwaves during that time period 
this was one of my favorite releases of 2005. I'd write a long review but I really think this is one that if you pluck the money down you won't be disappointed, and it's a little hard to put this into words other than to say it's exceptionally well done 
Believe received good reviews. It's better than advertised. Hold on tight while you listen to "Buffalo Bird Woman." This piece says it all. 
Klezmer hoedown meets world guitar-jazz with a heartland soul. Really, there's nothing quite like it out there. And Scott Amendola is to be congratulated for coming up with something not only genuinely new, but also so engaging. On paper, this doesn't seem as if it could possibly work--just too much weirdness to get things fully integrated. Let's take the aural signature. How to get two such iconoclastic guitarists as West Coast jazz splatter-king Nels Cline and Chicago avant-stalwart Jeff Parker to mesh? And how does Jenny Scheinmann, longtime Frisell violinist, fit into the picture? Won't these people be getting in each other's way? How will they mesh? Will there be sufficient timbral differentiation? All these questions are more than answered, and in a quite dramatic fashion, on the nine numbers herein. What's most surprising to me is the sheer beauty that leaks from these grooves. I'd expected some pretty out and somewhat unapproachable sounds given the personnel and label--and there's plenty of that--but it all comes wrapped in a very beguiling, and sometimes downright sensuously gorgeous, package. Just check out "Shady," for an example of what I mean. Should appeal to fans of Frisell's latest ventures, and anyone seeking heartlandish instrumental jazz of the highest order. One of the very best releases of 2005 
"Believe," the third album by percussionist Scott Amendola's band, whose most recent high profile gig is with the Nels Cline trio, combines not only the talents of the aforementioned guitarist, but those of Jeff Parker, erstwhile jazz guitarist and axe slinger of Tortoise. With Nels in the left channel, Jeff on the right, navigating an eclectic but concise program of multi-genre, post-bop jazz, "Believe" is an open-minded jazz guitar lovers dream recording. Buttressed by Jenny Scheinman's gorgeous violin playing, John Schifflett's thick bass lines and Amendola's multi-genre percussive work outs, the quintet equitably covers abundant stylistic ground. The title track opens the album with a loose, improvisational feel, displaying the group's collective dynamics. "Oladipo," a syncopated Afro-Beat groove follows with its infectiously funky bass ostinato and syncopated guitar expositions. Post-bop traditionalism is fitfully embraced on "Smarty Pants." Mentioned as a homage to Neil Young's Crazy Horse, "Buffalo Bird Woman" sounds like an instrumental work out of one of Neil's more epic tunes. Continuing the Americana thread, "Shady" finds the band in Frisellian territory with part-time Bill Frisell co-conspirator Sheinman taking the lead on a tasty slice of down home roots music that wouldn't sound out of place on one of Bill's own records. Noisier, anthemic fare rears up on the aptly titled "Resistance" while Latin rhythms dominate on "Cesar Chavez." Although on paper this sounds like an exercise in globe hoping dilettantism, Amendola's band inhabits each of these genres and in so doing manages to bridge the tenuous gaps that sometimes divide them. Easily one of the finest albums of 2005, "Believe" is not only a jazz guitar lovers album, but a record capable of wining the hearts of anyone with an interest in quality improvised/composed music 
I thought the movie had good points (the action was dead on as to what can sometimes happen with trucks and cars in accidents) and bad (the theme not all drivers are bad). I'm a trucker and sometimes other drivers don't think before they do things or worse they figure that we have all those wheels so we have to have more brakes. not true. I liked the movie because it gave people a different perspective. The sound track has gotten me through many long miles and long hours. "Highway Junkie" being my favorite because as my trucking uncle and my dad say once the diesel gets in your blood you can't get it out 
I thought that the movie was ok, but it was the soundtrack that made it great. With the variety of songs, from slow to high intensity, it is just a fun album to listen to. Especially in the pickup on the way to a Rodeo 
Great country music I listened to when I was going down the road hard in the late 70's and through the 80's to make 8. Lane was an explemetary person, and one hell of a bull rider he always came to ride. 
If you haven't seen this movie - then you aren't a part of THIS world! This movie is awesome!! I am a serious bullriding fan and I think that all 3 actors portraying Lane, Kelly and Tuff did an EXCELLENT job - great movie, great soundtrack. I bought them both and absolutely love them! 
Like the movie this soundtrack is awesome. Its even better than the movie because you can't see some of the bad acting. Still its one of the best cowboy movies of all time and this soundtrack makes it even better 
This cd was wonderful. Once I seen the movie I knew I had to get the cd. The cd just blows me away. Not only does it have fast dancing songs. But it has slow dancing love song. Like the one by Reba "If I had only knew" Just get the cd and watch the movie and get the cd you will understand 
The soundtrack to the movie 8 SECONDS is actually better than many "Greatest Hits" compilations. Because the album consists of songs by some of the best country artists of our time, it's hard to choose one song over another, but there are a few standouts. One is the beautiful and tender love song "Standing Right Next To Me" by Karla Bonoff. Another, Reba's sentimental and very moving "If I Had Only Known". To me this song is to 8 SECONDS, what "My Heart Will Go On" was to TITANIC. But the album is by no means only a selection of slow love songs and ballads. "Texas Is Bigger Than It Used To Be" by Mark Chesnutt, along with Brooks &amp; Dunn's "Ride 'em High, Ride 'em Low", and "Just Once" by David Lee Murphy are but a few of the snappy tunes you'll find here. No lover of country music (nor fan of the movie) should be without this CD in their collection. Like "Once In A While" by Billy Dean, an extraordinary album comes along "once in a while" that is better than most. This is it. For anyone in doubt, let me just add that "Lane's Theme" by Bill Conti, a beautiful instrumental, is worth the price of the album alone 
If you enjoyed this movie and good 'ole tear jerking country music, this is an essential to your collection. Billy Dean's "once in a while" describes the premise of the movie perfectly while Bill Conti's theme keeps you quiet. Although there is some soft sentimental music, there is a good variety of rough and rowdy cowboy lyrics with Brooks and Dunn and John Anderson. Overall excellent sountrack 
The music goes PERFECTLY with the movie! They put the soundtrack together beyond perfection. This soundtrack has everything from flashy songs that make you want to just get up and dance to a slow piano song that makes you want to just sit down and cry. I honestly have to say that this is the best country soundtrack that I've ever heard/owned 
This album by Marty Robbins was among my first every purchases in the area of music. It is largely western standards and original material. All of the songs tell a story with good harmony, excellent instrumental accompanyment and just plain good music from a long time successful popular singer and songwriter in both the popular and country music of that era (about 1955) - I have bought this album in vinyl, cassette and now in DVD since the cassette has finally worn out. It is as good today as it was back when 
forget any labels...country, western, whatever...this is a timeless piece of art. people from all walks of life and fans of all genres will appreciate the soaring baritone of marty robbins, and the beautiful stories told on this record. an aboslute classic. 
I was thinking this CD would be one of those that I like despite the cheesiness; but it's not cheesy. It's sincerely cool. Marty Robbins makes an even cooler cowboy than Bob Dylan or Jerry Garcia. And the recording sounds better than most anything else from the 1950s. Get this album 
We had this album in the 1960's and my dad loved it. It was a real treat for me to find it as a CD and get it for him...he loves i 
Now this is what I call Country Western Music! Today's music may be country, but it's more rock than western. I grew up listening to my Dad's old 45 rpm versions of these songs and was thrilled to be able to pick up the extended CD 
I really do. In fact I never liked it - but I love Chet Atkins, Johnny Cash, and ESPECIALLY this CD by Marty Robbins. That should tell you something. What a recording masterpiece, a true gem. I'd bet that this is the album that inspired Workingman's Dead. All the songs are about dying and desperation on the open plains - what could be better? Put this on, and relax to memories you could never have possibly experienced 
I've owned this album for only three days and it's already my favorite album of all time, of any genre. The reverb on the vocals is noteworthy; it imparts an open prairie feel to each song. The simple, unobtrusive instrumentation allows the vocals to really soar. "The Master's Call" is incredible. They don't write songs like this anymore 
You get to buy the CD I bought a few years back with only 12 tracks with a bonus of three extra -- total of 15 tracks [I always told you, Amazon loved you best]. This is a very good collection of Marty's songs and the production values are also top notch. To me it's a question of which Marty Robbins' album to buy. This one is a good choice. If it only had "Five Brothers", it would be perfect. Nashville is great, but to borrow from the Alan Jackson hit: "Gone Country"... if you want to "Go Western", buy this one 
I bought this cd a few days ago and already know its a classic. The reviewer who gave it one star because the song order was not right, needs to get a life. I hate reviewers who give a star or two because of dumb crap like that. This cd is diffently better then anything you'll hear on a radio. Country singers are greedy. Everything you need to hear has been written and everything today is about sex and alcohol. These songs tell a story, and Marty Robbins probably wasnt too greedy for money like todays stars are. He was a proud American, but not because of 9-11. Yea im talking about Toby Keith and Alan Jackson right there. Great music, a diffent must own cd. 
and use it on the talentless, commercialized, white trash trolls who call themselves "country" singers today: that idiot Trace Adkins and his hip-hop country rap crap, and Kenny Chesney et al- you guys aren't fit to shine Marty Robbins's boots. Marty is the real deal- great voice, talented guitarist, master lyricist. This disc has a great Western feel- my personal favorites here are "Running Gun" and "The Master's Call." Put this in your CD player and hit "play through"- there isn't a bad song on here. If you're a fan of the "Honky Tonk Badon-kadonk" and other CMT video crap, you best look elsewhere. I hear Wal Mart has some good CD's by a talentless asshat named Garth Brooks. 
It is rediculous that so many people should be furious with the soundtrack release of this film. I question their sensibilities at not checking what music was on the score - it clearly lables all tracks by James Horner. When watching the film i felt that the Das Rheingold opera was too intrusive whereas Horner's score may not be particularly thematic but its slow beauty matches perfectly the onscreen images 
I am a big fan of Terrence's films and also Horner's previous work on film scores. While I can understand some of the frustration with this soundtrack, I would certainly not say it is a waste. The film is beautiful and so is Horner's music. Tracks such as "A Flame Within" and "Of the Forest" continue, after months of listening, to take my breath away. This is a worthwhile one to pick up, especially if you are a fan of James Horner. Like Terrence's film, the music transports you to another world, that is, if you let it. 
I understand that some people were upset with the missing songs from the movie, but I do not think it is fair to say this CD is worthless. I am a huge fan of James Horner and film scores in general, and I think this soundtrack lives up to the cinematic beauty that Malick's film showed. I often listen to my favorite film scores (Braveheart, Pearl Harbor, Pride and Prejudice to name a few) while reading or doing work, and this CD definitely makes my soundtrack playlist. There are some beautiful pieces on here such as "The New World," "Of the Corn," and "Forbidden Forrest" that should not be overshadowed by the missing songs that have caused so many people to say this soundtrack is not worth the purchase. I think that if you are a fan of epic movie soundtracks or just a fan or orchestrated scores this soundtrack will be very pleasing. Also, I know there are no previews on Amazon, but if you go on iTunes and search for James Horner in the music store you can find previews to the entire soundtrack there. 
I bought this cd thinking the music from the movie was going to be on it. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Don't bother getting this cd, its not even worthed. I wasted major money and Amazon should've had the songs on preview, but they didn't help either. A Shame 
I just received my CD and absolutely loved it. I agee with the others, it brings to mind Braveheart and Titantic, and that can only be a good thing in my mind. I know the Horner tradmarks and love them. Very, very moving rich music. I haven't seen the movie and this makes me now what to see it. If you're not a Horner fan, skip it. But if you are, it is well worth the money. Too bad it wasn't included in the Oscars musical score nominees 
Everytime the same discussion...when will the Horner-haters let go ? Yes I do admit...some sections of this score sound a little like Titanic, and some others sound like Braveheart...BUT SO WHAT ????? This is one of his most incredible soundtracks up to date: listen very well, the aura around all these tracks are different than his past works and you can feel it after a few listens...again, yes the sounds are similar...but it's the James horner sound...the 4 note ascending motif, the female subdued voice, the shimmering piano notes and the ethereal vocal pad...it's him and you'll hear it in many of his works but...it does the job. This one is a gem...very emotional, beautiful and mysterious at the same time...great song performed by Hayley Westenra...should of been nominated at the Oscars. I really feel we are about to hear Horner's best stuff in the near future. Thanks Mr. Horner for another great score (****). 
I became familiar with Shirley Verret through this recording. The team of principals are excellent and Maestro Abbado is fantastic with the orchestra. This recording shows the unique and amazing artistry of Ms Verrett in one of her signature roles. She remains unsurpassed in this account. Brava! 
This is probably Deutsche Grammophone's greatest release. From a 70's LP, this remastered recording stars Piero Cappucilli and Shirley Verrett as Shakespeare's most wicked couple- Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. At a bargain price, this is a real treasure. It is on the top lists of the greatest opera recordings ever made. Shirley Verrett is still hailed as the ultimate Lady Macbeth. Upon performing the role in La Scala for the first time, she was showered in jewels and carried over the shoulders of ecstatic fans to her limousine. As a bonus, this recording features Placido Domingo in the minor role of Macduff and Nicolai Ghiurov as the ghost of Banquo. Claudio Abbado, an Italian conductor, understands the complexity of the score but does not sacrifice melodic richness and the mix of sprightliness and ominious grandeur found within the score. Piero and Shirley are on fire as Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth! Their scenes are full of fire and dramatic heft, their voices soar above the orchestra's fortissimi and they each provide a kind of dark, tragic granduer to their roles. Very few singers match their level of expertise. Perhaps only Leonard Warren and Leonie Rysanek in an earlier Metropolitan Opera performance equalled them in success. Cappucilli has a dark, edgy voice and even reminds me of Samuel Ramey, whom to my knowledge has not sung Macbeth but would sound a lot like Cappucilli. Furthermore, Cappucilli died recently and this is a tribute to his great artistry. Miss Verrett is awesome, and her renditions of "Vieni T'afretta," "La Luce Langue" and the Sleeping Walking Scene are among the best, ranking with Maria Callas, Leonie Rysanek, Birgit Nilsson, Elena Soliotis and Carol Vaness. Verrett claims she was initially afraid to get into such a dark frame of mind for the role but her voice is perfectly suited for this character, despite her origins as a mezzo. It is her Lady Macbeth that most people recall with fondness, eventhough Grace Bumbry, too, sang the role in Salzburg early in her career in 1964. However, I favor Verrett's Lady Macbeth over Bumbry's. Without a doubt this is a terrific Macbeth and you won't regret buying it. It is truly the definative version while others pale in comparison 
There is tough competition for the best recording of 'Macbeth', but for me the combination of Abbado's explosive and rhythmically taut way with the score and Shirley Verrett's tour de force as Lady Macbeth give this one the edge. Verdi famously maintained he wanted a 'she devil' in the role of Lady Macbeth, and it is a role that has been essayed by both sopranos and mezzos, with varying success. Fiorenza Cossotto (in the rival EMI Muti version) has more idiomatic Italian and forward projection, but sounds generalized and rantingly melodramatic besides this much subtler performance. The variety of tone colours Verrett produces is awesome - the duet with Macbeth (a more than usually involved Piero Cappuccilli) is a locus classicus of opera as theatre. She has the heft and volume when needed (I don't understand the gramophone critic's reservation about Verrett's top notes - they ring out thrillingly) and yet produces an extraordinary performance of the Sleepwalking scene that once heard, haunts the memory - complete with perfectly placed pianissimo top Db. Cappuccilli sings with burnished tone and is suitably histrionic in the Banqueting scene, though not as alert to nuance as Giuseppe Taddei on the Schippers set (alas not recommendable, despite a strong performance from Birgit Nilsson, as it is a Schippers edition with perfectly idiotic cuts, snipping away at some of Verdi's revised moments.) No this is the one to have, Domingo and Ghiaurov give strong support, Abbado's way with the music, from the rum-ti-tum witches and the ballet to the Lady Macbeth scenas and pre-murder duet with Macbeth, the dark heart of this uneven but fascinating score, is fervent and Toscanini-like in its precision, and above all Verrett's mesmerizing performance give this one the palm. It's a classic of the gramophone, buy it, a bargain at mid-price 
It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94. The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version. It's anemic. Lacks the punch. In a word -- sucks. That you're not told this on the cover is misleading. I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music. All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific. 4-5 stars. But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio 
The fact that I am writing this at all shows that I really appreciate Mr Sumner's work and have been a fan from the days of The Police, however, in my opinion, Fields of Gold is the best collection yet. Strong lyrics, great rythm, beautiful sound. It's the only Album that I am in love with EVERY song on it. I got it as a gift but I certainly would have thought of it as the best buy if I had bought it myself. It's truly worth listening to 
I have been a fan of Sting ever since I was in college. I actually got to see him in person in the late 80's. I have just about every cd he has ever put out so when this one did I ran right out and bought it. Every song on it is great and it IS one of my most favorite cd's I own. 
Sting's best of album from 1994 showed such a remarkable transition from a hit making band the Police into a successful solo artist. I'm kind of put off by the album title because I didn't hear any new solo music from him in 1984--we heard his first album out in 1985! All my favorites are on here, from If You Love Somebody, Russians, We'll Be Together, All This Time, Fields of Gold, Be Still My Beating Heart, Englishman in New York, Fortress Around My Heart (how it shifts from soft mood to loud rock guitars back to back and then back to soft is quite something!)and others. I love the two new songs; sort of a '90s trend for some artists making greatest hits albums. I still love When We Dance 11 years later; proof that his songs still remain timeless! This is such a smartly done collection that doesn't rely on his hits, but on some more artistic songs that weren't singles too. He is a true pop star for the ages! 
This CD is so great. Sting always had a style that resonates with (my) heart and soul. His music and messages are really timeless. If I had to suggest one Sting CD to get, if this is your first buy, get this one - you really won't be disappointed! 
I love "Englishman in New York" and "Probably Me" best,though the other songs are also touching and contagious. The melody, the lyrics, Sting's voice, all these are so harmonious when put together and create a unique atmosphere, which you can only find in Sting's works 
After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A M released "Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings. Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does "Fields Of Gold" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives. Positives: -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes "If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)", "Fortress Around Your Heart", "Be Still My Beating Heart", "Russians", "We'll Be Together", "All This Time", "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You" and "Fields Of Gold". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here. -The sound is great. -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation. -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single "When We Dance". Negatives: -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: "Love Is The Seventh Wave" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat. -"Mad About You" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd. -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of "We'll Be Together". -No liner notes. -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like "I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying", "Brand New Day" and the top twenty hit "Desert Rose". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on. Overall, "Fields Of Gold" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection 
This is one of his better CDs. This is one of my top 3 Sting picks behind All This Time and Mercury Falling 
First off, let me say, this is a great CD. It is worth your money. An Angle is a great band. Now...So, ok, ive been a huge Bright Eyes fan for years now. love Conors work. and i must say, when i first heard An Angle, i was pissed off. i though, this has got to be a joke... it sounds so much like Conor and Bright Eyes. what a rip off.. Those thoughts went on for a while.. untill i gave An Angle a chance. once i did, i found that there music, though a lot sounding like Bright Eyes, is amazing. great songs, lyrics, emotion. really, a great band. There first CD, i will admit had a lot or Brigth Eyes rip-offs.. its true and clear.. but its still a great CD and i would buy it if i were you. This CD is less like Bright Eyes and more like... well, An Angle. it really is amazing. Great song structure, vocals, and diversity in songs /instrements. Also, pick up there new 5 track EP. It is amazing. Really. all in all, BUY THIS CD. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT IF YOU ARE OPEN MINDED AND GIVE BANDS A CHANCE 
I recently saw An Angle, and it was close to amazing. They didn't really play too much off this album, and when I asked them later I was told that most of what they had played was on their new ep. They did, however, play my favorite songs from this album. Green Water, A Way With Words, True Love, and Change the World. I have listened to this album almost non-stop since buying it and I don't really see that ending any time soon. It's really funny to me, seeing all the negative things people have posted online about An Angle. It really makes me wonder how many of these people have actually listened to this band. I understand the similarities to Bright Eyes, but come on, it is very obvious that they are different bands. I think people should stop paying so much attention to message boards and form their own opinions on what they like and dislike. This band is great, and I can't wait to see them again 
I love how someone was calling the people who thought that they "werent" the same, stupid. first of all, the person who is the center of this band is named kris, as bright eyes is conor. they have seperate last names as well! would you look at that! yeah, he does sound like conor, you have to be an earless brainless idiot to not see the similarities. dont act like youre above everyone and super obscure by saying they dont sound alike. because they do. and conor has uniquely adopted this style of music which is.. obviously being posed off of. i could see if an angle maybe used his singing style and then chose his words and writing style differently, or even music writing style, but he doesnt, he goes right with copying off of bright eyes, and that's not very creative or commendable, whether or not he is a drunk like conor or not. just because conor drinks doesnt mean he puts on any less of a good show.. here's a question.. ever been to a bright eyes show? oh, obviously not 
First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar. But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet. However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking. 
NO, An Angle does not sound like Bright Eyes. No, An Angle does not attempt to copy Bright Eyes. Kris puts on the best show and is a great guy too. Conor is such a drunk that he can't finish a single song live without messing it up. Buy this album and go to An Angle show 
alright... i cannot stress this enough. they are the same person. have you seen pictures? yeah look closely. have you heard their voices. yeah exactly the same. so quit saying they are trying to be like bright eyes, they are bright eyes. embrace it, and enjoy. if you like bright eyes, then you should just listen to the album and not judge it. cheer 
obviously, an angle sounds exactly like bright eyes in many respects. but, the truth of the matter is that this album is much more like a streamlined discover america. maybe i should just say that... this album is good. i don't listen to bright eyes much, because i don't connect with the music as a whole. but somehow, i really like this album. i have no clue about it except that i really dig it. listen if you like bright eyes, discover america, or the more mellow twothirtyeight stuff. end 
i couldn't help but notice all the dismay displayed in the reviews below about 'an angle' ripping off conor oberst (bright eyes). i'd just like to point out that conor originally ripped off a lesser known, less poster boy type, called DAVID DONDERO. he is an extraordinary original talent who conor was (and probably still is) a big fan of. without conor's indie boy looks style, david holds less potential for mass marketing, which is why he hasn't had conor's success. you should check him out, and remember he was doing his thing way before conor bounced on to the scene was given credit for his originality genius 
They were never to be heard from after that one album, but if you want a gem of a collection of imaginatively melodic jazz riffs and licks along the lines of Spyra Gyra's Morning Dance, Dave Samual's Ten Degrees North and ShadowFax's Magic Theatre, this is one jazz nugget of a find. I caught Friendship one night back in 1980 on Johnny Carson and immediately had to get their album. And I'm not an impulse buyer and I'm very picky with my music selecting. I was also sold when I found Friendship brought onboard Weather Report's percussion powerhouse of Alex Acuna and Peter Erskine along with other very accomplished studio musicians to round out a very hip jazz/funk group. There's a slap bass solo piece on the album very much in the style of Weather Report's Jaco Pastorius which played on the Carson show and sold me on the spot. I don't know about Captain's Journey because I'm not a Lee Ritenour fan. Since there were no follow up Friendship albums I gave up looking. I'm buying the CD just for the Friendship part. 
Finally available for the first time on cd Friendship I had this on Lp and was wondering if this would ever be issued on cd and here it is as 2 lps on 1 cd with Captains Journey.These are great maybe Wounded Bird will reissue other Lee titles as 2 on 1 time will tell. Get'em while you can. Highly Recommend!! 
This was the first time John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams worked together, and thank heavens it wasn't the last. This is one of those brilliant scores that is hummable the first time you see the movie. It easily surpasses this duo's work on Shrek but doesn't quite exceed the simply perfect music to Chicken Run. In short, this score's greatest strength is its diversity. The main character has a catchy cool jazz theme. The ant colony is a rollicking march with a steady pulse and a whistled melody. The villain has a moody choral piece. And then a sort of tango melody for Dan Akroyd's character. In anything but an animated film, this mish-mash of styles would seem out of place and obnoxious, but Powell and Gregson-Williams make every moment interesting. Repeatedly, the scores reaches emotional highs and adrenaline highs that can do nothing but satisfy. What makes the music even more interesting is the various source music included. The dance club numbers and the "Ants Go Marching" rendition, far from disrupting the flow of the album, compliment the style and variety of this wonderful score. This is a must-own for any film score collector or fan of the film. There are beautiful sounds here, and I wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if know one but these two fine composers ever scored a Dreamworks animated feature 
With Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell teaming up scoring a film, great things usually happen and this is a great example of that. Antz is a fun and exciting score that is a joy to listen to because when it is good, it is really good. Several different themes are present throughout. One is found in "Z's Theme" which features lush string playing with some harmonicas and percussion. Another theme is found in "Princess Bala", which features the woodwind section of the orchestra. Another theme that can be found is a military style theme that is present in "General Mandible" and "Mandible and Cutter Plot". Some tunes that get up and make you want to dance like a moron are found in "The Colony" and "6:15 Time To Dance". The version of "Guantanamera" is dull and boring so don't pay much attention to it, unless you like it of course. The old civil war marching tune "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" is parodied in the track "The Antz Go Marching To War" which is actually a great track and a highlight of the album. 3 excellent action cues are present including "The Magnifying Glass", "The Big Shoe", and the thrilling "Z To The Rescue". An all around great score that Dreamworks does an excellent job of doing. The sound on the album is outstanding and the orchestral performance is dynamite. Kudos to Gregson-Williams and Powell and their partnership, which is becoming one of the best in film music 
Having the movie based on a colony of ants, one would expect a more mechanical, crazy sounding score. Suprisingly, you get a more rythmic, electronic score with some very catchy tunes. The themes in the score are all great in their own ways. Z's theme is a laid-back, and calm. The colony theme is rythmic, crazy, and one of the catchiest themes I've ever heard. General Mandible's theme sounds, well, military-like and is played by some exotic instrument. Bala's theme is short but also serves its purpose. The score has a lot of energetic moments in the score and never loses that energy, even at the explosive ending. Not being a big fan of electronic/orchestral scores, I found this one to be great and enjoyed the electronic, Latin style in the score. I highly recommend this score if you like happy, energetic, catchy music. Its sound is unique and is a highly underrated score 
I admit it, whenever I saw the CD of "Antz" for the first time, I was so sure that it would be an awful score. But, this CD is single-handidly one of my favorites. My favorite theme on this soundtrack is "Z's Theme", a very comforting and relaxing theme. Let me tell you this much, if you enjoy an easy-on-the-ear enjoyable score then buy this soundtrack, you will not be sorr 
I like this CD. The music is lively and fun to listen to outside of the movie context. However, I was disappointed because some of the great musical moments in the movie are not on the CD. The end credits, the popular songs (like "I can see clearly now.") are not there, and the reference to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" that you can hear during the magnifying glass sequence is not present on the soundtrack 
this cd is by far one of the greatest things i have ever heard, and this is coming from a guy who listens to slipknot, trivium, korn and stuff like that but i've always had a softer side to and this album pulls it right out of me. right from the begining i knew that the slow drum tapping beat and low bass where gonna go somewhere and sure enough at 4:09 comes the first hard riff and it was so awsome how they led up to it though that the whole rest of the cd i could'nt switch or fast forword any of the other songs, i had to hear them all the way through. even when it came to "the nurse who loved me". at first i was like, huh , eeh, but after a couple times listening and hearing the lyrics i won't change it, even to the day if it comes on in my car my friends are listening to it, like it or not. all the radio song where great, if you don't know them you must have been living under a rock. but when i got this cd i got it with "aMOTION" THE DVD-REMIX CD SET, and when i got home i watched the dvd first and saw the "counting bodys like sheep" video and loved it, then come to my suprise on "thirteenth step" number 10 "pet" has the same lyrics but is definently not the same song(if you've heard, you know what i mean)but it was'nt til later when i got "eMOTIVe" that my friend told me it was a complete cover album pretty much, then after i listened to it i saw that they covered their own song "pet"(who else has ideas like this) and ever since i figured that out "pet" has always been my favorite song on this album. and this album is a most have for ANYBODY!!! (DEATH METAL AND RAP FAN, OPEN YOUR F#*KING MINDS 
This is pretty nice laid back, enchanted music. I like all the songs but still enjoyed the music of tool better. Though I was always trying to find a more laid back version of tool with a darker, more melancholy mood. To me a very unknown english band more than fills in that void, a band called Anathena. I so happened to come by the album by a refrence from 10 years review. I cannot believe the album isn't very popular in the states, it amazing, layred, melody's flow from it and you become obsorbed in the etheral state it puts you in. If you like this 13th step, check out Anathemas judgement, or any other album, it smokes maynards side project, but is right up there with tool, just more laid back 
A Perfect Circle is a remarkable band -- heavy, gothic, great vocals. It's like the Cure meets, well ... Tool. "Blue" is perfect. "Pet" is heavy and creepy. And "The Nurse Who Loved Me" is the most curiously endearing song I've heard in a long time. 
This is a good album - by far the best APC release. I am hooked on it. My favorite tracks (in order) are The Noose; Gravity, The Outsider, Blue; the Package; and Weak and Powerless. Don't expect APC to be Tool, they aren't (and if they were, why would Maynard have bothered to do something different anyways.) If you want to try out APC I would buy this one. The 1st release is ok. The 3rd is crap. Sorry to put it that way, but it is. 
Let me just start by saying that I love A Perfect Circle, and I actually prefer them over Tool (love tool, just apc more). Mer De Noms was about as good as you can get for a debut album. And the fact that it sounded so much different than anything Tool had ever done made me just love it. Could this album reach the level of greatness that Mer De Noms had? Let me tell you that it does. In fact, dare I say it might just be a better album. Thirteenth Step is a powerful, moving and haunting piece of work. Maynard once again shows why he has to be one of the greatest frontmant in the history of music. His vocals on many of the more mellow and haunting songs just give you chills. The Noose, Blue, and Vanishing are examples of this. On the other hand you have songs that have more of a Tool feel to it, such as The Outsider, The Package, Weak and Powerless and Pet. So this album really has everything you could want if your a Maynard fan. But if your a Maynard fan than you already own this album. This album does take a while to understand, you simply just can't grasp everything on only a few listens. It really is a stunning accomplishment, and I hope APC gets to back togeather to record more music, because this my friends is music done right. 
I cannot stop listening to this disc. I am waiting to get a little tired of it, but I've been waiting for 2 years now, and it hasn't happened. It is tough to put into words a good description of this disc. All the previous reviews did a much better job than I could ever hope to. But give this disc a chance. Don't listen to it once or twice and toss it aside. While there aren't too many similarities with Tool, one that stands out is the complexity of the melodies, and it takes your mind some time to adjust and pick them up, but once it does, these melodies are indellibly planted in your mind. Others have mentioned the diversity on this disc and they are absolutely correct. What I find truly amazing about this disc are the slow, melodic tunes, specifically "Gravity" and "The Noose" I actually made an iTunes playlist solely with these 2 songs, and I can listen to it for hours on end. I can't explain, but these songs take you somewhere. I do not write very many reviews, unless it's something I wish the whole world could experience. Try it out with a little patience, and you will be pleasantly surprised at what you didn't hear the first 5-10 times you listened. 
With this release A Perfect Circle really did show what they were capable of. This has to be my all time favorite release by the band. I love everything about this album because from start to finish it stays great. That is if we ignore the track "The Nurse Who Loved Me". I'm not quite sure what to make of this song. My guess is it's something to lighten the mood but it doesn't harm the album all that much anyway, just adds to its awesomeness. To think that it only took them 2 years to create such a masterpiece. My favorite tracks are probably "The Package", "The Noose", "The Outsider", and "Gravity". Anyway here's what I think of the whole album... 1. The Package - 10/10 2. Weak And Powerless - 10/10 3. The Noose - 10/10 4. Blue - 10/10 5. Vanishing - 10/10 6. A Stranger - 10/10 7. The Outsider - 10/10 8. Crimes - 10/10 9. The Nurse Who Loved Me - 6/10 10. Pet - 10/10 11. Lullaby - 9/10 12. Gravity - 10/10 Overall: 96% A Everything on this album just flows. It just seems to make up what APC is about. The whole album is just a mixture of soft, hard, and sometimes even funny moments. "Thirteenth Step" is a prime example of why I love A Perfect Circle. It's APC at their finest.  
APC along with Alice in Chains (among others)manage to convey the most mesmerizing display of human emotions within song structure. Thirteenth Step is, from top to bottom, one of the most amazing albums I have been fortunate enough to hear. Maynards voice is firm yet angelic, and the music almost attains perfection. I cannot say enough about this album, but of course, that means nothing. Go check it out, you'll be more than satisfied that you did 
I'll give this album 5 stars just for the package. Great follow up album although it took me 2 years to actually start to like the music..i actually gave this cd away after i bought it. All in all a good buy. Also i believe Maynard James Keenan gets too much credit, he is a great vocalist but it's all the band members that make a band not just the lead singer. Take billy howerdel out of perfect circle or Danny Carey out of tool and than tell me how awesome the bands are 
Let me get this out of the way first: A Perfect Cirlce is NOT Tool. They never were, and I hope they never will be. With their second album, APC puts any Tool similarities far behind them. On Mer De Noms, yes, the similarities were there, especially with their single "Judith." However, here on Thirteenth Step, they have managed to step out of the Tool mold, and create a sound all their own. Maynard's vocals have never been better, and the instrumentation is incredible. The band often uses a bizarre arrangement of instruments, but they somehow manage to pull it off. Their songs range from epic (The Package), to dark (The Outsider), to melodic (The Nurse Who Loved Me [which is a cover]), to straight-up rock (Pet). There aren't very many albums you'll find anywhere with this kind of diversity, mostly because there aren't many bands who could pull it off. The lyrics, voice, and music fit together seamlessly, and the album really works with a "concept" as opposed to just a bunch of singles stuck together. Some might say that there are a few "filler" tracks. This is not the case, as all the songs work towards creating a concept or story. Really, this an exceptional album, and one that any fan of music will be happy to have in his/her collection 
Was a good cd, not much more I have to say about it.. 
I didn't even know who he is until I purchased the album and it turned out to be a surprisingly good album 
OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something. I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees. "Bad Day" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the "Breakfast in America" album to me. Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp. I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit. Leo never used that many keyboards 
This whole CD is awesome. So is Daniel if you get a chance to see him live 
Shows unity amongst all of us. All can and do relate. Proof of old souls housed in young bodies ( earth suits ) existing. Daniel is certainly not a one hit wonder, and the other tracks on this CD SCREAM THAT MESSAGE OUT LOUD AND CLEAR!! A True Artist 
Alot of people review this CD after listening to only one song - (Bad Day) and say that nothing else on the Cd can possibly compare to this song. And while it is true the 'Bad Day' is most definitely the best song on the album, the others are not far behind. There are enchanting melodies in almost every song and not many that i'd want to skip past. There are the upbeat and fun songs like "Lie to Me", "Suspect" and "Hollywood" and also the slower but still enjoyable songs like "Free Loop" and "Jimmy Gets High". An album worth your money, i say. It doesnt sound like these songs get old fast. Daniel Powter is here to stay 
Daniel did a great job of putting this CD together within his own apartment. Of course, the American Idol LIVE performance has only propeled him to the spotlight with "You Had a Bad Day" 
Earlier, I had an LP called "Best of the Band" that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. This is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length. There are a lot of "best of/greatest hits" type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited number of songs and length. This IS a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money. The music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals. It gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime. As an aside, 3 of the Band members (Helm, Danko, and Hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's 
Wonderful! Just like I remembered!! Thanks so much 
If you're a casual fan of The Band, and just want one disc in your collection, this is for you. And if you're looking for a place to start, well, this is it as well. Not a literal hits compilation, "Greatest Hits" brings together 77 minutes of highlights from The Band's classic albums (released 1968-1975). The Band were an idiosyncratic outfit, blending folk, rock, country, R and a little bit of soul and gospel, and their tenure as Bob Dylan's legendary touring band made them a supremely tight and versatile ensemble. And this disc includes all of their best-known recordings, from the surreal folk-rock narraive "The Weight" to the vivid "Saga Of Pepote Rouge". This is all highlights, really. The Band's wonderfully evocative cover of Bob Dylan's "When I Paint My Masterpiece", all acoustic guitars, violins and ringing mandolins, is worth the price of admission by itself, and originals like "Acadian Driftwood", "Up On Cripple Creek" and "The Shape I'm In" are equally spellbinding. And the musical variety is amazing, spanning gospel-flavoured New Orleans soul, country western, straight-ahead R, and of course the vivid folk pastiche "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", a song which must have come to Robbie Robertson straight out of the 19th century. This is one of the finest compilations on any artist. The quality of the music assembled here is unbelievable, and everybody with any interest in music owe it to themselves to get acquainted with The Band. Five stars easy. Very highly recommended 
From their beginning as Ronnie Hawkins' backing band to their days touring with Dylan and on their own, the four Canadians and one American who made up "The Band" forged a connection between country and rock that was unique in its purity and complexity. The Band didn't go for the obvious "rock band trying to be country" approach of Gram Parsons' projects. Instead, they fused their love of roots with the emerging sound of first rockabilly and then pop. And when they were done in 1976, they had become a force to be reckoned with. This collection culls some of (but not all) the best from the Band's discography, with the qustionable selection of the last two tunes coloring an otherwise excellent collection. The hits are spaced out with other selections that might not be so familar (for example, the beautiful "Tears of Rage", "Time to Kill", "King Harvest", etc). The overall effect reads like a great tribute to the music that these innovative men created over their career. The sound is fantastic as well. You really feel like the music has been lovingly treated so the listener can get the best out of it. If anyone wants to know what all the fuss is about, you could probably play about five or so tracks off this collection and win a new convert to the Band. So pick this up if you want to get some of the best American music ever recorded. Nothing beats the organ intro to "Chest Fever", the horns on "Ophelia", or the musicianship on "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down". And "It Makes No Difference" is quite possibly the most beautiful torch song ever penned. Just ignore the last two tracks (which are okay but not spectacular enough to merit inclusion), and you'll enjoy every minute of this splendid album 
The Band is one of pop music's most glorious accidents. This was a group of road musicians that lived from nightclub to nightclub, and had little likelihood of rising much above that scene, until Bob Dylan rather whimsically decided to make them his onstage backup band to perform his newfangled "rock" songs in the mid-60s. Then, because they were neighbors in upstate NY, they played on the demos that became "The Basement Tapes." Anyone who spent that much time with Bob Dylan might well decide, "hey, I should be a songwriter," and that's what some members, chiefly Robbie Robertson, did. When it came time to record their first album, what blossomed was their road-hardened musicianship, combined with the Dylan-bred desire to make of each recording a new thing unlike anything else that has existed before. Thus, amazing tracks like "Tears of Rage" and "The Weight" came into being. Along with covers of yet-unreleased Dylan songs like "This Wheel's On Fire" and "I Shall Be Released," the "Music from Big Pink" album essentially changed the course of American pop for a few years. If Jimi Hendrix was the most influential US musician in 1967, by 1969 it was the Band, and that's a radical shift. It turned out they didn't have a bottomless well of great songs in them, but the quality at the beginning is astonishing. Robertson (with some help from Richard Manuel) was able to fill the Band's first two albums and most of the third with nonstop classic songs. They stumbled badly with their fourth album, made a great album of covers and a great live album, both taking advantage of their superb musical skills, had a partial creative comeback with their seventh album, and then ran aground for good--Robertson essentially admitting he was out of ideas by planning the grandiose "Last Waltz." If the question is, "are these the Band's 18 best songs," the answer is not quite. "Time to Kill" doesn't belong here, nor does "The Saga of Pepote Rouge"--the weirdest choice of the bunch. I might argue with the inclusion of "Rag Mama Rag" over "Whispering Pines," "Unfaithful Servant" or "Across the Great Divide" from the second album; and you could argue for "In a Station" or "Lonesome Suzie" instead of "Chest Fever" from the first album. "Stage Fright" seems underrepresented--where's "W.S. Walcott's Medicine Show," or "Sleeping"? I could lose "Ophelia" to make room for those. Also, why no selections from the live "Rock of Ages" album? Not only do you miss "Baby Don't Do It," but the live version of "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" is a tour de force, and belonged on this instead of the studio version. All this really means is, you should get this (as I write, it's $7.99. They're practically giving it away!), but then go out and buy the first three albums, plus Rock of Ages, Moondog Matinee and Northern Lights, Southern Cross, and appreciate the unlikely little miracle that was The Band. 
Look, the Band were the best ever, but again I cannot over-stress the importance of listening to the original albums. There is so much more to go. Anyway, you can't really compile the Band like this, and believe me because I've tried several times on my own. All of the songs are great, but it is probably a travesty that "The Rumor", "Whispering Pines", and "Hobo Jungle" were not included. Yeah, I realize that they were crucial to the albums that they are from and that they are probably best heard there, but these tracks offer the best of Richard's voice and of Robbie's songwriting. Then again, the same could be said of "Jupiter Hollow". Anyway, you'll want all the albums after buying this, and it is a beautiful sounding way to start, but don't think that it has all you'll need: no one can go from "Ain't Got No Home" to "It Makes No Difference" and feel completely satisfied. In any case, it's essential. 
When I got this disc, I had heard no other song by The Band, than "The Weight". I love that song, but I didn't know what to expect of the other songs and didn't know if they'd appeal to me. I was actually quite impressed with the other songs. The Band is really in a class by itself. They don't really sound like anyone else and their music is a mixture of so many different genres. Rock, R B, Country, Cajun, Folk, but it all sounds good. I'm glad that I got this disc, even though the songs are kind of different, but different doesn't mean bad. Just unique. I think The Band deserves more credit, in music history, than they've gotten. I would recommend this to any serious music lover 
Why? Well, The Weight, I Shall Be Released, Up On Cripple Creek, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, It Makes No Difference, and Arcadian Driftwood are here, plus others. Listen to this album and experience beautifully written lyrics, beautiful musical collaboration, and a variety of voices and vocal styles. Stories are told through these songs. I particularly admire The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down because it tells remarkably heart felt story of the Civil Wars effect on the South. Coming from a Canadian band, this seems odd at first, but to hear it is to know compassion and humanity. It Makes No Difference may be my favorite song though, as the story of a break-ups ravaging effect is beautifully evoked: "...and the Sun don't shine anymore...and the rain falls down on my door..." There is terrific, funny juxtaposition I love on When I Paint My Masterpiece, which tells of a trip to the Coliseum in Rome, where he has a vision amidst the ruins of: "...dodging lions, and wasting time..." For lovers of the film The Last Waltz, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, and of course, Bob Dylan, this album serves as a terrific collection of superb music from a legendary band. 
Also for Baywatch-fans this CD from The Band is a worth recommendation to their collection. The CD contains the song "Life is a carnival" that was used for the very first Baywatch-episode "In Deep" (1989). While hearing the song, you'll remember the crowded Venice "Muscle" Beach from California... If you are interested in songs that featured on Baywatch, you can buy here on Amazon.com the Book: "Baywatch - Rescued from Prime Time". This book contains all credits from songs/artists (like The Band), that you can buy here on Amazon.co 
This was an absolutely TREMENDOUS CD. Especially recommended on Side 2 are "She Belongs to Me" ("She's an artist, She Don't look Back") and a Devestating Version of "Desolation Row". On Side 1 are "When my Ship comes in" (In the Video Baez tells how Dylan is upset that they won't let him in a Hotel because of his "Scruffy appearance", then as Baez tells it "So he wrote 'When My Ship comes In' He can't get a Hotel Room, so he writes when my Ship comes In"!!! Also on Side 1 is a "Catch Lightning in a Bottle" version of "Chimes of Freedom. AND if you like this CD, check out Baez's performance on YOUTUBE of "Diamonds and Rust"; Then go to the 1992 Dylan Tribute where the Clancy Brothers (and for this performance only Tommy Makem) do "When My Ship Comes In". You can't go wrong on any of these 
Just spent a day listening to the second disc while painting my house. I played it loud over and over while I worked. I have to say it's brilliant. While there is a lot of good stuff on this disc, the standout tune for me is "Visions of Johanna." The Band is absolutely in full form, and Dylan sounds like he's about to levitate. Couldn't have been a better day ... completely reinvigorated my interest in the man's music

If you have many of Dylan's albums of the sixties, this is an excellent addition. Disc one is solo acoustic and chronicles a songwriter coming into his own. Disc two is full of live and alternate takes that shed new light on the original versions of the songs. Sometimes alternate takes are meant to be kept off of albums, these versions are quite rewarding, and definitely worth repeated listens. The liner notes include other pictures taken from the album cover photo sessions. Here are some other fine albums you may like if you like Dylan: 1) Kings Avenue by Joe Kile 2) Stranger's Almanac by Whiskeytown 3) Banjos And Sunshine by Sixty Acres 4) Ain't No Grave: A Tribute To Traditional And Public Domain Songs by Various Artist 
In the lengthy reviews I'm reading, I seemed to have missed something!!! I truly found a real hidden treasure in the never before released records. It is Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat. This song alone is worth the money spent for the two records. It is super phenomonenal!!! It is an A+++!!! In his signature voice and intonations, Bob Dylan gives a very sexy take of this song that lasts (fortunately!!!!) 6 minutes!! It is PERFECTION!!!! It is very sexy, very funny and sung to ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. When I heard this particular verson of this song, I could not believe that it had never before been released!!! It is Dylan at his very very best! I was really astonished, really. Play it loud on very good equipment! Of course, there are other songs and takes that get first place, but this take on this song really stood out for me. It is very sexy, very funny and sung by Bob Dylan with this signature voice with the best of his signature intonations to ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!!! Signed, Nadi 
...there really was no downside to NDH (Unless you count my kids walking out after an hour. I was surprised that they stayed that long!) Bob has that gift of the ragged edge that I love so much. Any flaw just winds up looking like more of the "Swamp Preacher" or "Road Weary Prophet" or "Workingman Martyr" image he has. The movie is a look at Dylan, then and now. The interview footage is from 2000, when the project started and he comes across as just a guy. He takes the viewer into his world. I still don't know what kind of underwear he wears, but I think, if I saw him on the street, I'd just nod and smile. The rest of it is from the sixties, when he was at the height of his popularity. And the music is pure, raw, Dylan. For fans, it's mostly unreleased material. For the uninitiated, it's core, historic Dylan performances. It's a bit much for one sitting, like I did, but the break Scorcese put in is in about the right spot. This is a must for anyone with a serious music library. Even you opera fans might be tempted to say, "So, that's why he sings like that! 
This album is a must-have if you're a Dylan addict dying to see a slightly different angle on many of his great songs, and a few Dylan renditions of songs you've never heard him sing before. It feels like, and in fact at times is, a collection of greatest bootleg hits. Case in point: "Like a Rolling Stone." Before the song, Dylan gets heckled from the audience. He responds in a way only he could saying, in a loud whine, "I don't BELIEVE you, man." Classic. But the recording of the song is actually not very good. The acoustics stink, and the delivery is rushed and severe. One more example: the first verse of his "Man of Constant Sorrow" will blow away anyone who has seen "O Brother, Where Art Thou." Dylan's interpretation is THAT different, and THAT amazing. But on this, and other songs, there's a lack of balance. You have to work hard to get your ears past the piercing harmonica which is much mellower on other, less raw, albums. There's no denying this album really does offer something interesting, and plainly demonstrates the artist's towering abilities. But, if you own three Dylan albums and don't consider yourself an addict, buy (or keep listening to) "The Essential Bob Dylan," his best reasonably-priced collection 
Further illustrates the principle (useful to recall when you go to see him live) that when Dylan is on, he's unbeatable, but when he's off he's mediocre to outright horrible. And there's no way to predict which you'll get (of the two Dylan live shows i've seen, i got one horrible and one fan-f'n-tastically good, myself.) Several of the tracks on here suffer from less than pristine sound, and it can be seen why several others remain "Alternate Takes": "Desolation Row" sounds as if he's not quite sure of the lyric (or the tune, for that matter) "Blowin' in the Wind" has an overly-long harmonica intro (it's not the only one, but it's the most annoying) which includes a couple of those "miss the harp and blow on the mike" moments that Neil Innes satirises in his "Protest Song" ("I've suffered for my music, and now it's your turn...") in "Pleasure at Her Majesty's" and "Monty Python at Hollywood Bowl") "Ballad of a Thin Man" is both poorly recorded (live) and has a slogging-through-mud vocal delivery. And so on -- the sort of thing that you get in sets of alternate takes, out takes and live or demo versions of material from a popular artist's long career. But even the downer tracks are worth having, because they help to put the performer in perspective. And the "up" tracks are some of the best recorded Dylan i have ever heard -- particularly the Newport performance of "Maggie's Farm" backed by the Butterfield Blues Band that was part of the electric set that allegedly got him booed offstage (I say "allegedly" because, according to a transcript of the official tape taken from the soundboard and available online, it actually appears that the booing is mostly for Peter Yarrow trying to strictly enforce the set time limit on Dylan when the audience wants more). Whether or not Dylan actually got booed for that set, the performance that opened it, "Maggie's Farm" (almost impeccably reproduced here), might almost have been calculated to stick a thumb in folk purists' eye -- i had to keep reminding myself that this was only 1965 as the tight band roared through the song, with Dylan's vocal absolutely matching the fervor of the backup. I've never seen the Scorsese film from which this is the SOundtrack, but this is one of the few "soundtrack" albums that can pretty well stand up for themselves (in fact, one could argue that the soundtrack may well be more important than the film, or perhaps the film's only reason for existing...) Well worth the price. Buy it 
If you really want to know what these guys are all about...see them live when they come to your area...this is a compilation for the US of their second third Canadian releases, and is just a taste of what they do. Road Rage, their live CD...or the Great Big DVD CD is an even better representation of these fun loving Newfoundlanders. I've been to four of their live shows in the Burlington VT area since 2002 and I'm ready to see them again when they come to Lebanon NH in the fall of '06. Live in concert is the way to truly experience these guys. They love what they do and it shows. If you can't get to one of their shows, at the very least, get this and then the live albums, and by all means, keep going till you have them all (there are eight). Alan Doyle, their lead singer, puts it this way: "We're not a band you come to see or hear. Great Big Sea is something you do." Audience participation only gets them going even more, and it's impossible not to get caught up into it. Whoever said they were "annoying and cloying after a few listens" needs to learn how to cut loose and have a great time. These guys are the real deal 
Come in, take off your hat and coat and grab a seat near the fire. Order a pint of 'screech' and relax, the music is about to begin. Welcome to Newfoundland! 'Rant And Roar' is a fun, rollicking CD by the Great Big Sea, four native Newfoundlanders who draw their inspiration and music from a unique and rich cultural heritage. English, Irish, Scottish, French and who knows what else come together with a flair that reminds us all of what the "Old World" was like in simplier times. Though I'm not a native Newfoundlander I have spent numerous summer's there visiting the maternal side of my family. In my youth I've walked up and down Saint John's fishing docks listening to my Grandfather barter in Portugese with fisherman for the best price on the catch of the day and watched the icebergs float by while standing atop Cabot's Tower on the hillside overlooking Saint John's Harbor. All the pleasant memories of the time I've spent there is embodied in this wonderful music. Come with me to other time, another place and sing the type of songs your Grandparents sang. Songs of love, songs of life, songs for drinking and a dirge or two thrown in for good measure. Just be sure to bring your stomping shoes if you got any! My Highest Recomendation! 
If you like traditional Irish music that has grown with the times, this is for you. The album moves along at a great pace and there is just enough of Irish tradition to make you feel right at home. Don't try to drive while listening and singing along unless you have your cruise control set 
I am a clogging teacher and bought this CD because I wanted the music to "Jolly Beggarman" which is the hidden track (#14) on the CD. There are other songs I have enjoyed also on the CD such as "Merri-Mac". Fun to listen and dance to. 
This CD is a very nice mix of pop-rock and Celtic music. The upbeat songs are handled so well you can't help but sing along. The musicianship and arrangements are both excellent. GBS's version of "Mari-Mac" is the best I've heard anyone do and they handle REM's "End of the World as We Know It" very well. I've always liked "The Night Pat Murphy Died" and they do a good rousing version here. The only songs that get to me are the two ballads, both of which are a little too sappy for my taste 
Rockin' Maine music that keeps the wheels of equity turning 
A friend recommended this as my first GBS CD. I'm a great fan of bands like Gaelic Storm and other Irish/Celtic/Folk-sounding bands and had heard of GBS but never owned their music. I'll be adding other titles to my collection soon but am glad this was my first. Great introduction to a great band. From the notes on their website looks like they're headed toward the fame and fortune they've been working for. Spread the word, GBS is Great Big Fun 
I'm not really sure why I love this CD so much. As far as I remember, I wasn't particularly amazed or blown away by it when I got it over a year ago, hence I let it collect dust in the back seat of my car with countless other forgotten disks within a week. A few days ago, however, I was lying awake late at night skimming through my iPod looking for something interesting, and happened once again upon The Books. I hit `play,' and never looked back. What first greets your ear when you start this album is what can only be described as a swirling, brooding guitar pluck. The tune slowly but surely picks up urgency as the song progresses before it altogether disappears around the 3 minute mark amidst an all-out instrumental freak-out. Soon you realize that the guitar and other conventional instruments are just the beginning for this album. What The Books manage to create is a sprawling musical landscape of deep electronic beats and blips, string instruments, and some of the most unique samples you've ever heard. The samples themselves are what really decorate the musical landscapes, dotting the rolling hills and sloping deserts with all sorts of colors and interesting objects. They range from what sounds like a grainy radio recording from WWII Great Britain to what may be a shopping cart rolling out of an elevator and crashing into a wall. Some samples are so monumental they cast their shadow across the entire song, as is the case with "Contempt," a song that slowly builds around a sample of two men talking. What makes the samples so great is that they not only sound like nothing else produced today, but they also simultaneously provoke feeling and nostalgia in a way samples almost never do; just listen to the little girl in "Motherless Bastard" and you'll know what I mean. They are also so wide in variety that you can listen to a song one time and hear a completely different song the next time. I disagree that I am just "happy knowing that this music exists," as the last reviewer commented. I absolutely can listen to this CD over and over. Unfortunately, it kind of loses steam near the last few songs and loses some of its ambient charm. Still, there is no shame in hitting the `Restart' button; the first 9 songs are nothing short of amazing. Many reviewers have noted that this CD might not be for everyone, and I completely agree, however I also would wholeheartedly recommend Thought For Food to someone looking for truly interesting and unique new music far outside the typical indie music spectrum. You will be pleasantly surprised, believe me 
It is only appropriate to start out this review with my first experience with The Books since everyone will probably remember theirs as well. After a long, or not so long [its irrelevant] day my two friends and I decided it was time for a little cool down. We went into my friend's room while she turned out all the lights and left only the TV muted on static to light the room. Then she turned on this album and we all lay there and listened. I had heard The Books before but this, for some reason, felt like the first time I was really hearing them in their avant-garde entirety. The semi-random sounds and snapshot vocal samples seared the air in a summation of life and music. `Twas grand, to say the least. This album is really difficult to break down or sectionalize. As you listen to it, there are obvious changes of pace following the different songs, but somehow, the vein of the music always seems to remain in tact. From the first quasi-notes of "Enjoy Your Worries, You May Never Have Them Again" The Books seem to be reaching for a lifelike quality for their music that can really only be described by that same word: Life. This song has a straight beat that is surrounded by samples of people sort of talking through their problems. Mid-way through the song you hear an elderly lady discussing her problem with her heart conditions and some bad checks she was accused of writing. As this monologue goes on, you get drawn in until finally her voice seems to explode into nothingness and the song goes on. This type of forget-what-you-know attitude prevails with this band and particularly this album. The record continues regardless with "All Our Base Are Belong To Them" where the listener is welcomed to the human race (ironically by an unfamiliar voice) and the band softly croons "I was born on the day that music died," a vocal testament to the sheer originality of this record. At times it does make one question what is music. On "Motherless Bastard" a small boy is heard yelling for his mommy or daddy only to be met by a male voice informing him he has neither in a less than comforting manner. The song then continues serenely on in a fashion that almost makes one forget about the tragedy that opens the track. Fear not, though, we are quickly reminded of this terribly awkward and disheartening situation with a reprise of the clip. The pure emotion tugging power of this track is almost unnerving considering that this is probably the most up-front, straightforward track on the record. The rest of the record continues on in a similar fashion, by the end, anointing the listener with The Books' amazing version of human experience. 9.2/1 
I recently discovered The Books via a sampler CD from a magazine. I was immediately drawn by this fascinating stuff, best enjoyed, in my opinion, through headphones by a focused listener. I suppose it could be considered ambient in the Brian Eno sense that one can invest as little or as much attention to it as one wants. But I found myself fully attentive and working at hearing every little snippet. I heartily recommend this disc to those who are interested in experimental music and it's no-drone zone, y'all 
I dont really know what to write for this review. The music is weird and kind of like stuff I have heard, but somehow it works in a most unusual way. You must buy this CD and listen to it if you can handle out there stuff. I admit it is incongruous, tough to get a handle on, and not aesthetically "pretty" (not in a straightfoward way at least) but i love it. it is worth a try. you might really dig it. (Oh yeah, and this CD is better than Lemon of Pink 
Just to spite the fellow below, who actually still believes that the term "pseudo-intellectual" is even remotely insulting, when in fact it is a term of speech employed solely by those who are just that. This is an excellent record, not music by any means, but a very interesting listen, with a few surprises in store 
the endless spirals of complexity on this album are remiscent of works by boards of canada or up in flames by manitoba. gorgeous instrumentation; i hear new things everytime i listen to it. highly recommended 
The music captures the moods of the series. I only wish the Japanese versions of the songs were on the CD as well 
Wolf's Rain was a series of intense imagery, dramatic characterizations, and stark action sequences that lead to one inevitable goal: one of the best anime ever. Supplying a lot of the emotions in each of these moments is an excellent soundtrack, done by the well-known Yoko Kanno, who worked on Cowboy Bebop, Visions of Escaflowne, and GitS: Stand Alone Complex's soundtracks. It's quite clear that without the background music provided, this series would not have been the same. This CD provides most of the sounds and songs heard in the anime. What's odd about this soundtrack is that a majority of the songs are of the same genre, that being folk jazz (what's that? well, it's folk music with the tones and beats of jazz). This in no way takes from the soundtrack, and in truth it was kind of refreshing to find a soundtrack for an anime where all of the tracks were on the same page. Of the twenty-one tracks, eight of them are vocalized, and these tracks were translated for an American audience. Some may find this disconcerting, as the beauty of anime music usually comes in the Japanese vocals. But I don't think it was that bad in this case, since the new voices were excellent. Though all of the tracks are great (and I do mean great), some of the tracks had a touch of excellence in them: Track 01: Stray: Worth a listen simply because it was omitted from the TV version. Track 02: Requiem: An emotional instrumental sound played with a piano. Track 09: Strangers: A trumpet sound begins this song, and then a beat slowly works in followed by some excellent vocals. Track 11: Tip Toe Waltz: It sounds just like the title. It's the odd-ball track of this album, and is fun to listen to. Track 13: Could You Bite the Hand?: A guitar sound with some quick vocals sung by the same man who did the opening. Track 19: Run, Wolf Warrior, Run: It sounds like something produced in the late 70s. It's a beautifully sung song. Track 20: Gravity: The final vocalized track is another emotional song sung to a piano background. Once again, I definitely think all the songs on this CD are worth a listen, and I wouldn't recommend skipping any in order to get to the ones above. Like Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack, without this soundtrack, Wolf's Rain wouldn't have been the same. If you have Wolf's Rain and loved the music, get this, or if you saw Wolf's Rain on TV and enjoyed it, then get the Limited Complete Collection, which comes packed with this CD and all the episodes. 
Yoko Kanno is a brilliant composer. Her work is legendary in the anime scene, her name for music in a series is like a stamp of approval. Sounds strange, but it is true. Like in Cowboy Bebop, the music makes you feel strong emotions while watching the show and again when you listen to it alone. The vocalists she works with are all very talented and their specific voices work well in different ways. Steve Conte's singing in the opening is very raw and passionate and the music is steady and strong. There are slow songs with soft, lilting vocals where we must feel emotions gently tugging at us. Then there are the fast and frantic songs for the action-filled and stressful times. This OST is a complete package of all the different styles and feelings of the series, and it's great for just a listen alone too 
I love Yoko-kun's songs!!! These songs trully show how one can have difficulties in life and still keep there head up high. Wolf's Rain is my FAV. anime! It's songs and show's touched my heart..and you might beleave it ( maybe not.. o-o') when I hear these songs and watch the show..I begin to tear..:D. For real, this is an amazing CD!!! It just blew me away!! The songs are sooo beautiful. So, go on and see for yourself 
I am a really HUGE Wolf's Rain fan, and I was blown away by the music. The composer, Yoko Kanno, does a wonderful job. I listened to this CD countless times. Don't stop and think about it, just get it, because you will NOT be dissapointed 
This is a really cool CD! I love Wolf's Rain! It just makes it even better to be able to listen to it's music whenever I want! If you like the series you should buy this CD! The songs are just mind blowing! It's amazing! But you don't have to take my word for it...just go buy it yourself and see! P.S. Gackt Rocks 
Buy the time Cheap Trick recorded at Budokan, they were more or less superstars over in Japan. While their first three albums didn't burn up the charts in the U.S., in Japan they were hits, that went gold. Live at Budokan was originally going to be released in Japan only, but when a couple of DJ's got a hold of imports, and started playing I Want You to Want Me, people started to become interested in Cheap Trick at Budokan and were forking over the big bucks to buy the import. In 1979 Epic records decided to release it here in America, and hold back the release of Dream Police. At Budokan is a great album, because it captures the magic of Cheap Trick in concert, there's a lot more energy in the songs and performances than the album versions. Live, Cheap Trick has something they just can't capture on their albums. Currently they have Cheap Trick at Budokan the complete concert, I would recommend springing for the double disk set instead of this version. Both are great 
Yeah, it is not sound recording excellence, nor the greatest sounding performance. It grows on you, and you keep comming back to it. You will probably never admit you like it around your friends. I can imagine life without Surrender. One of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time 
This album is of course a classic just as it was originally released, but the extra songs on the complete conert cd are almost all great, and 3 of them (southern girls, elo kiddies, and auf wiedersehen) are must-have amazing. shell out the xtra 6 bucks or so and get the 2CD set is my strong recommendation for anyone wanting to hear what's probably the best live rock album ever

I love this album - it's John Mayer goes soulfully blues - the combo is amazing. "Belief" is my absolute favorite song on this album - I love the lyrics and the music. Every song is great, though, and I could (and have) listened to it on repeat for days. Absolute fabulous next album - the same John, but not the same music 
Once again, John Mayer proves his amazing talents as vocalist, musician and poet in his latest work, "Continuum". As always, his music stirkes a chord in the heart while his lyrics speak of the realities of life as it unfolds. This album will not disappoint 
As a die hard Hip Hop fan this was the first John Mayer album I listened to. This is a wonderful album, almost magical. I wish I could have been in the studio when this was put together. This won't be my last Mayer album...I can call myself a fan now 
This CD is a little more bluesy with a little bit of soul than the first one but John Mayer's music is still the best of any new artist ever. You will love it 
I don't know where to begin, I was floored when I listened to this for the first time. Now it seems like the millionth time that I am playing it. There isn't one thing that I can possibly be critical of. I thought you were unique when I purchased your very first CD. It was so mature for such a young guy. In this, your latest CD - Continuum - the guitar playing is a phenomena and so much like Clapton. The lyrics and how you sing them becomes hypnotic and i find myself playing the CD over and over again as i do work on my computer. It puts me into such a mellow frame of mind. Having said all of this, it is only fitting that i rate it 5 stars - Simply Reyna 
This is by far his best album. He goes for meaningful yet witty lyrics and the music is a mix of old and new. I can't stop listening to this one!! My favorites are "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" and "I Don't Trust Myself". This young man has had a lot more life experience than his age would suggest. We need him around for a long time!! 
This cd took some getting used to- not the "usual" John Mayer. "stop this train" (not sure if exact title of song) is my favorite. Chances are you won't be disappointed. Would have rated this 4 1/2 stars if I could've ."Any Given Thursday" cd is an awesome live cd-check it out 
John Mayer continues to amaze me with his creative lyrics, amazing guitar skills, and musical versatility. This CD will not disappoint. From the great vibes of "Vultures" to the thought-provoking lyrics of "Waiting on the World to Change," John Mayer is one of the most creative artists of our time. And, as a 50+ female, he's also not hard on the eyes. I've got all his CD's and can't wait for the next. 
by far John's greatest work. I feel like he is going to be here for awhile, he is the real deal. He is improving with every song, every cd. He is on his way to greatness 
i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
The CD contains a little bit of everything, but all songs familiar to my daughter 
My 3 year old requests to listen to this CD over and over again! It is fantastic since I know the words to all the songs too. I love singing and dancing around the house with my son to this CD. It is much better than laying around the house and watching another movie. What was even better was listening to this CD on our last road trip. I never heard a peep out of him except his singing! It is a MUST HAVE! 
As soon as we tell my daughter that we are going bye-bye, she asks if we could listen to Elmo (aka this CD. At 20 months she was singing along! It has all the great children's songs I remember. It has become one of our favorites from Sesame Street 
This CD may not contain Townes Van Zandt's best known material, but taken in the context of when this performance was recorded the song selection makes sense. Townes was 25 when this was recorded at Carnegie Hall and hadn't written many of his most famous songs yet, therefore other reviewer's complaints that he didn't play "Pancho and Lefty" can be dismissed as ludicrous. If Townes hadn't written the songs yet, he couldn't have included them in his set (!). The previously unreleased "Talking KKK Blues" is Townes at his spoken blues best. The sound on this CD is phenomenal and what is striking is the way he projected in a concert hall like Carnegie Hall. I guess this struck me because I'm so used to hearing his live recordings in tiny dives like the Old Quarter in Texas or McCabe's guitar shop in California. Townes' voice was in top form and his guitar skills were also top notch during this time period, and while his song selection for this gig was his more subdued material I don't find this to be negative. This recording was lost in the shuffle between record labels but now that its been released it serves as a valuable document of Townes' early years and his budding genius. Despite the fact that the songs here could be classified as rarities, I would go so far as to say that this would be a good introduction to Townes Van Zandt's music. His humor and personality shine throughout the performance and it is refreshing to hear him at the peak of his powers 
This mellow CD catches Townes in a show he did at Carnegie Hall on Nov. 26, 1969, as part of a Poppy Records showcase. Also on the bill were Dick Gregory and Mandrake Memorial. Poppy Records went belly-up and the recording went to United Artists Records, then later to Capitol Records, which is releasing this on the Dualtone label. Townes was just 25 when this recording was made. If you expect a long show, expect to be disappointed. Remember, this was a "showcase," so he performed just nine songs. Fortunately, unlike many live recordings, the between song dialogue has been left in (maybe to make this CD seem longer!), which is nice. Townes' chatter with the audience is almost as entertaining as the music. He mentions that he'd been playing professionally for just three years, so this short CD captures all of what must have been a magical evening -- hence the title, "A Gentle Evening with Townes Van Zandt." Some of the songs that night came from Townes first two albums, which had already been released, but the real gem is the opener, "Talking KKK Blues," which has never been released. "Talking KKK Blues" is so much fun that it's a shame it took 32 years for it to make it onto a recording. As I said before, this is a fairly short recording of just nine songs, so if you want a 70-minute CD, you might want to pass on this. But if you want quality of music, not quantity, then spend a gentle half hour or so with a very, very young genius-in-the-making 
Glam, sexual, unforgiving, sad and honest and it Rocks at the same time, just awesome. If you dont have it, you are missing out. A lot of energy in this one 
Mott the Hoople had covered lot's of ground since the first album was released way back in 1969. Described as "Dylan's, Blond on Blond meets spacey Roller Skating Rink music" the band had nothing to prove to me by the 1973 release of their 6th record " MOTT ". I was a crazy off-kilter teenaged wastland and their music was the soundtrack of my life. Still I was upset over " Dudes " as not being the best way to represent this great band. Sorry to tell you kid's, but once you labeled Mott the Hoople a 'Glam' band you destroyed them! "Dudes" turned Mott the Hoople into "Corporate Product " and ripped the Guts out of their center. The Great Verden Allen left the band after being labeled one of "Bowie's Chldren " and then the death blow came right after the release of this album with the departure of Guitartist Mick Ralphs. Ian Hunter was non to happy of the labels being slapped upon this great band after David Bowie's production on "All the Young Dudes " became their commercial Breakthrough to AM radios in the United States. And on "Mott " he now had something to prove that Bowie DID NOT invent this band. In his anger and the loss of Allen the Songs flowed and the Group took over Production to disprove it was all a 'Magic Act' from the Gods of Glam. Proof that Greatness was still lighting the fires of Rock was "All the Way From Memphis" (as used in the film "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" by the son when he is pissed off at his Mother, and he blasts it at her). "Hymm for the Dudes" shows the band want's to break their ties to Glam, But refuse to throw out their Platform shoes just yet. "Drivin' Sister" is flat out Rock, and one of the best songs written and performed by ANYONE! and in it's simple drive, it is PERFECT . Mick has only one selection featured here "I'm a Cadillac" and it's been labeled as a 'Minor Tune' but it is a Stellar production and features the best playing of the band on "Mott". Mick DID deserve Fame Fortune but Bad Company pales in the shadow of what Mott the Hoople could have been. It all ends with "I Wish I Was Your Mother", those mandolins echo on to the Heavens. If you want a list of the 10 Greatest Rock Albums of the 70's "Mott" would be on that list, as the group was one of the best of that decade. Another record follows this one and it pales when it is compared to this, and features a REALLY CRAPPY GUITARIST then came the live album three years too late and after the fact with some really sloppy playing and a REALLY CRAPPY GUITARTIST but those last two recording were the most popular things they released and remain their Legacy Forever, well they did Burn Out and didn't just Fade away. "MOTT" is a FIVE STAR RECORD by a band that had a lot to say with only a very short time to do so (1969-1973). The Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame is a JOKE... This was OUR BAND Anger Angst... This is Rock, at it's very BEST 
Mott the Hoople was never a great band. They never could hold their own with either Bowie, Bolan or Queen. They put out three very good albums(Dudes, Mott and Hoople) and a lot of other stuff, before Mick Ralph got a better offer and headed off to Bad Company and Ian Hunter got feed up with the rest of the mates and went Solo. What this band is about is being the soundtrack of your life in the early 1970 The album Mott was the best of the lot. The remastering did a great job cleaning up the songs. However the bottomline and appeal of this album was remembering what your life was like when these songs where on your "top of the pops. 
By the time of 1973's "Mott," the band was reduced to a four-piece after a disgruntled Verden Allen flew the Hoople, all the while grousing about his role in their stage act. While it's certainly arguable that, as Keith Smith postulates in his liner notes, this is the band's best sounding album, it just may be their most accomplished in terms of songwriting and playing. Full marks all around for standing up to CBS and producing it themselves with some uh, mothering from Bill Price and Alan Harris. Ian Hunter's career-long schizoid methodology comes to full fruition with 1972 tour memoir "All The Way From Memphis" (ever notice the best sax players always seem to be named Mackay?), scruff rockers "Whizz Kid" and "Honaloochie Boogie," and the self-mythologizing "Ballad Of Mott The Hoople." "Violence" is one mean, cold, slit-eyed mother of a tune, hitting with all the subtlety and sensitivity of a flaming 747 full of orphans crashing into a mountain, "Drivin' Sister" may just be the best car song outside of the Chuck Berry or Bruce Springsteen catalogs, "Hymn For The Dudes" still gives me the chills 33 years on, and "I Wish I Was Your Mother"...well, great song (Mick Ralphs wrestling a mandolin into a tap-out) but Freud may be needed to sort out Hunter's lyric sheet. Bonus tracks, while not as bountiful as those on Columbia's simultaneously-released "All The Young Dudes" reissue, are crackers; the studio version of live staple "Rose," demos of "Honaloochie Boogie" and "Nightmare," and a live "Drivin' Sister" from an incandescent Hammersmith Odeon gig. Although being devoted to Mott The Hoople nearly ruined my high school education, kicks and guitar licks waging war with arithmetic, it sure beat coping with a steady diet of purple microdot and Mad Dog 20/20 
MOTT, the greatest album ever released by Mott The Hoople, is an outstanding masterwork containing a great deal of psychodrama, which is ironic for a band so closely associated with the glam-rock scene. Of course, Ian Hunter's and Mick Ralphs's roots actually were fairly deep, following from such literate writers and bands as Dylan, Neil Young, the Beatles, the Who, the Kinks, the Stones, and even Hank Williams, Sr. and Johnny Cash. The entire album is a treatise on how staying in the past too much can have devastating consequences, especially the ballads "Hymn For The Dudes" and "The Ballad Of Mott (26th March 1972 Zurich)", both of, which along with several other songs on this CD, particularly "All The Way From Memphis", express, for me, why I gave up food-related alumni functions at my old school in favor of losing weight in case I ever bump into any of my favorite celebrities. That's pretty good for a bunch of guys who wore makeup and platform shoes on stage. When I first cited these songs to people who asked me why I gave up dinners and luncheons at my old school over these particular actresses, the CD I referred to was poorly mastered from late-generation tapes. Now, however, I can play it for them in full, digitally-remastered glory, taken from the original master tapes. If you're able to, sell your original MOTT CD and get this digitally-remastered version, because the instruments and especially the lyrics are much more understandable on this new version than on the original CD or cassette. This remastered version is a must-own for anyone who enjoys literate, thoughtful rock roll 
This is actually the first LP album I ever bought over thirty years ago. I listened to it again after a very long time when this remastered version was released. I think some of the hype being said about this album is way overblown, although it is a very good record by one of the seventies most notable also-rans. Some of Ian Hunter's Dylanesque Dylanisms are overly Dylany, as on "Ballad of Mott" and "I Wish I Was Your Mother", but the overall strength of the songwriting outweighs his croaking out of his sometimes clumsy lyrics. Worth owning for the immortal "All The Way From Memphis" alone, but the rest of the album is a fun ride. 
Greatest ever? Yes. Without a doubt. Comparisons? More poetic than "Exile on Main Street." Harder and louder than "Ziggy." More focused than the first New York Dolls album. "Mott," along with those 3 and "London Calling," comprise the 5 greatest rock'n'roll records ever made. "Drivin' Sister" is a heavy metal Rolling Stones song. "Ballad of Mott the Hoople" and "Hymn for the Dudes" are Dylan done with flash. This was the pinnacle of glam rock, but also a precusor of punk. There is none better. On this new remaster, the sound is clearer, and the bonus live tracks give you an idea of Mott's fury on the stage 
The booklet that comes with every copy of 'Mott' contains this description from 'Rolling Stone': "The best album from the best band of the early-seventies." I don't quite buy into the idea that Mott the Hoople was the best band of the early-seventies, but 'Mott' is definitely one of that decade's shining lights. Melodic, wistful and rocking, 'Mott' remains the sole album where this star-struck band was able to put it all together. It oozes disillusionment, testament to their one step forward, two steps back existence as they continually battled indifference and inter-band conflicts. True to form, no sooner had they finished recording their breakthrough than guitarist Mick Ralphs left to form Bad Company, leaving a hole in the band that would never adequately be filled. The band was perfectly balanced by Ralphs' economical but highly-effective guitar playing, and Ian Hunter's dramatic vocal style. While Hunter's vocal mannerisms could be a bit over-the-top at times, the contrast was powerful, and each seemed to complement the other. Always literate, Mott had a talent for depicting a certain lost grandeur and melancholy that was very English. It couldn't have been lost on Hunter how Mott's fortunes mirrored those of England at large. But when the mood seized them, they could rock with utter abandon. "All The Way From Memphis", "Honaloochie Boogie" and "Whizz Kid" are the honking, stomping proof. 'Mott's bonus tracks are strong, and Bruce Dickinson's remastering is wonderful. It leaves the band's heft intact while articulating sonic detail and separation. To anyone who grew-up listening to 'Mott' on vinyl, it is a revelation. Best of all, 'Mott' remains untouched by classic rock radio. So anyone wanting to taste this wonderful slice of seventies rock needn't worry about an expired freshness date. Thank you Sony/Legacy from the very bottom of my heart.  
Mott the Hopple's best album has finally been sonically upgraded making this the best sounding edition of their best album. Produced by the band themselves Bruce Dickinson has gone back to the original tapes, spiffed them up and picked out just about every sonic detail you can imagine. Heck, this sounds better than the vinyl version I bought in the 70's. The bonus tracks have all been released before. "Rose" has appeared on the Mott the Hopple anthology (although never sounding this good) while the demo for "Honaloochie Boogie" (with different lyrics)and "Nightmare" (by departed organist Verden Allen)both appeared on the "All the Young Dudes" 3 disc anthology released in 1998. "Drivin' Sister" is pulled from the UK double CD/remaster of "Live" and is a killer live performance. I'm not sure what Columbia/Sony has in the vault but I would have liked other live performances of material included here that hasn't been released before. Surely there were other shows recorded for that album? Anyhow, the bonus material is welcome even if it has been available before because many fans may not have had the opportunity to purchase the "Dudes" anthology. The booklet features the original lyrics along with a brief essay about the band and the recording of the album. I was a bit disappointed that more information wasn't included on the recording of the album in the form of interviews, etc. but many Mott the Hopple and Ian Hunter fans will be familair with the circumstances under which this album was recorded. Written primarily by lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Ian Hunter, "Mott" provides an unflattering glimpse into the machinery of the music business. Hunter turns his jaundiced eye on the business of rock and how it dehumanizes at the same time it glories. Or something like that. Either way "Mott" is one of the finest albums of the 70's with the band in top form. This remaster sounds terrific, has bonus tracks and a nice booklet to boot. What more could you ask for? By the way those who want to purchase "The Hopple" the 2002 remaster from England sounds about the same as the version available for download. 
this record has to be one of the best from a great decade of rock music. great place to start for the unfamiliar. my only gripes are why they only gave a recording date to all the way from memphis and forgot the others completely and who added the EXTRA HORN PARTS to that song? i prefer the original over this and hope they correct it soon. it has to be a alternate take but don't let this stop you from buying. it will probably take sony another 20 years to correct it 
This band was anamazing addition to the music scene in my home town. It is an absolute tragedy that they broke up. I can only hope they will reunite. It should be part of every music lovers collection. Too add to the amazing talent throught out the cd it is also graced by the singer of Dolly Trauma on track number 10. 
It has been a while since I have heard a group with as much balanced musical talent that is fearfully displayed here. A well rounded set of death inducing riffs that leaves the listener with a sense of anger and physical adrenaline. The vocalist produces an unimaginable rollercoaster of emotions through sounds that seem foreign from a humans limits. Backed by the previously described musical ferociousness this album is a definite necessity to ones music collection. Get it 
ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS. This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations. Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae. This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture. You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot. It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing. Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat. This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long. It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States. Each CD more or less covers a specific "tour". Her back up band changes from CD to CD. You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger). The sound quality is amazingly good. It is sharp and crystal clear. There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories. About 80% of the material is spoken word. There is some music. It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production. The recordings come from early in her career. She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums. I would suggest getting her other CD's. Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD). Don't get the Home of the Brave CD 
I remember seeing this performance series being advertised in The Village Voice &amp; wanting desparately to go...but at 17, I didn't quite have the wherewithall to get the $ together to go &amp; have always regretted this. But it was soon enough after that I had a summer job &amp; the LPs were available. The sound was rather thin &amp; scratches noticeable, so I bought the CD box soon after that. I always see this box set around (new &amp; used), so I'm surprised that people say they haven't been able to find it. I always had half-wished that it had gone out of print, if only so that it finally gets the digital remastering (from the original tapes) that it deserves. The one thing that has bugged me about the set is that there is occassional popping/crackling noises that makes it sound as if the cd's were mastered from a pristine LP. The sound on the LP's was always very quiet &amp; you had to turn up the volume, which made any surface noise extremely unpleasant. The CD's are louder, but the tape hiss is more obvious. Some cd's are already on their 3rd remastering.....so it seems that an upgrade is long overdue, SACD would be nice too 
I had the good fortune of attending this two day performance in Brooklyn. It felt then like we were participating in something special. Looking back it was as I can't think of anything else from the 80's that was in anyway cultural or arresting. Maybe the Clash's first night at bond's before the fire dept showed up? Anyway during intermission the second night my current wife then girlfriend accidently kicked Grace Jones in the ankle while she was sipping champagne. We thought she was going to kick both of our asses. Luckilly Phillip Glass was walking by at that moment and struck up a conversation w/ her and save us from such humiliation. Plus it was so hard to get a cab to take you from the city to brooklyn back then 
A few people have written that much is lost from not seeing the visual of United States....(though they also say it's still a fantastic CD) There exists a book, though kind of hard to find now, that almost transports you to the Brooklyn Academy I highly recommend checking that out as well 
When I heard this album was out on LP i drove 100 miles (total) to get it. After wearing out two copies, and a couple of tapes I had given up hope that it would ever come out on CD. Lo and behold, on a road trip with my design class, there it was in a record store. If only they had made a video... oh well.. I actually got on an airplane to see her in 86 and met her at a party afterwards. Ok so Im a big fan 
One of the many qualities that separates Laurie Anderson from the sub-par pop world of the Backstreet Boys and Korn is her unerring intelligence, and it is on full display in the ambitious four CD box set entitled "United States Live". Taken from a series of shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Anderson attempts nothing less than a cultural, historical and psychiatric dissection of America. Though this was probably much more interesting to watch (as it included the use of multimedia which is obviously incompatible with audio formating), the songs nevertheless work on a cerebral level, the likes of which have seldom, if ever, been duplicated. Utilizing her electronic violin, Harmonizer and toy saxophone (among other instruments), Anderson has concocted a tour de force of sound and expression. Admittedly, each of the 78 tracks available here are exceedingly intellectual and demand the listener's full attention; consequently, one cannot listen to this box set in one, five, or even ten sittings as though it were a simple collection of pop songs. The themes, multiple meanings and interior layers of each track unfold gradually with repeated listenings. It is also of note that a few of the songs included here can also be found on Anderson's first studio album, 1982's "Big Science". Personal Favorites: the history of Tesla's relationship with Einstein that accompanies the song "Dance of Electricity"; the philosophical musings on the nature of human motion found in "Walking and Falling"; the pseudo-Native American vocal rhythm of "Hey Ah". Representative Lyrics: "I can see the future and it's a place- about 70 miles East of here." ("Let X=X" 
This is probably the best warped comp. out there to date. I got this cd about a year ago and i still listen to it all the time. Anti-Flag Deviates Bouncing Souls Vandals Agent 51 H2O Swingin' Utters It doesnt get better than that peopl 
I love this Cd. It's one of my top 10 favorite CDs in my collection of over 600. Every song is great, and i think i'll always own this CD. The reason i entitled this review "A Perfect Finish" is because this is the last decent Warped Tour comp that has been released to date, and none will ever top it 
Well I have to say that AFI made this comp worth buying. A Winters Tale incorporates everything about AFI that is great. Tsunami Bomb also has a strong showing and Bigwig had an awesome song. Rancids effort was sub par but they make up for it in their real album 
Ok....usually the Warped Tour comps [are bad]....but this is the 1st one that is 95%...good from begining to end. First off, god bless the LOST CITY ANGELS, Boston's finest. Ans Tsunami Bomb,....I usually dont like punk bands with girl singers but I play that song over and over agin in my car. The only song tha [is bad] is the Madcap song...boring boring borin 
hey i'm bri and i just felt the need to say how pumped i am that some of the not so known bands are on this comp. my homies madcap and lost city angels... you go boys!... i have done photography for other bands on it like bouncing souls and bigwig(we rocked the downtown steak n shake together). flogging molly is a super nice band! along w/ madcap and one man army(i love those kids).. they were all on the true believers tour w/ the souls. im so happy most of my pics turned out awesome, so if you wanna see them, give me a shout out! i've also done shots for bands like suicide machines, etc. I had so much fun punkin/working @ the warped dates i went to(indianapolis, tampa, pontiac) and it was the best summer of my life!... this cd kicks! the ataris will by my favorite til i die. i love that song and its a statement for so many things by the way it clashes w/ everything else. i love being this way! (... 
This album is a collection of songs (most unreleased) played at warp tour. If you are not sure if you like punk, or if you do not know which bands you like, this gives you a preview of all of them. It includes most popular punk bands and gives you a taste of what they sound like. This is also an excellent album for the collector, for it includes many previously unreleased songs. The CD includes an incredible performance by Flogging Molly and A New Found Glory, which alone are worth buying the cd. This is much better than any punk compilation I have ever heard and is recommended to the new born punker 
"Difficult Music" is a track composed by Laurie Anderson to introduce one of her song / stories. It's also an excellent way to descibe a majority of her work. She has never been a pop artist. So it's misleading to think this collection is a "greatest hits" retrospective. Laurie Anderson, the performance artist from New York City, has very few tracks that received radio or video airplay. Even when singles were released like "O Superman" and "Sharkey's Day", they were hardly soaring up the charts. Yet she worthy of this release for changing the way we think of performance art today and music in general. A better description is an anthology of Ms. Anderson's works from her Warner Bros. years from 1981 through 1995. In that respect, it covers most of the essential tracks that were not just popular amongst her fans but shows the diversity of her work. True, "O Superman" is a fantastic minimalist piece that hit the pop scene especially in Europe. But she can go the other way too, like the comedic and carribean influenced "Babydoll" about a conversation with her brain ("He says, take me to your leader". And I said, "Do you mean George"? He said "I just want to meet him". And I said "C'mon, like, I don't even know George"!). Most of her works deal with the battle of the sexes and inability to communicate ("It Tango", "Laguage d'Amour"), travel ("Big Science", "Lighting Out For The Territories"), and oddities of life. As her recordings progress, we get the increased sense of fear creeping into her work. Fear from society's woes like war ("Night In Baghdad"), AIDS ("Love Amongst The Sailors"), and jealousy ("Poison"). The collection ends appropraitely with selections from "The Ugly One With The Jewels", tracks that were recorded live on stage. Not songs, but spoken stories of her youth and from encounters from years of touring accompanied with minimal musical background. Ms. Anderson has always considered herself first and foremost a storyteller. Her stories are always given a slightly artistic tweak and become introspective searches of who we are as people and how we relate to others. "Talk Normal" is a quality look back at one of the more creative and interesting recording and performance artists today 
New to Laurie Anderson? Then you must shell out 30 bucks to pick up her anthology Talk Normal. I'm glad i did. How can you resist such great songs such as O Superman, Sharkey's Day, Smoke Rings, and Language Is A Virus? Just buy this already, i also recommend United States Live 
I had very high hopes for this anthology, but was indeed disappointed to discover that many of the cuts were re-mixed. Rarely, have I ever heard a re-mix that was superior in quality to the original release. This is especially so in Ms. Anderson's case, where the original material is always of such high and sublime quality 
What's crystal clear yet extremely dark and goes 70 mph ? The Laurie Anderson Anthology CD, "Talk Normal" playing in my car. Oh boy, right again. Nice package, really nice... hey the included booklet is in full color. Now I can leave the rest of my LA CD collection at home safe and tote this around to abuse my sensibilities with. Is this supposed to be "LA's Greatest Hits" ? I think so. The album credits LA as the producer so obviously WB and LA combined forces in the name of repackaging. This two-CD plus booklet package spans Laurie's studio work from 1981-1995 and only Warner Brothers material is on here (under the Rhino label). This includes material through her Nerve Bible tour but that's it, so nothing from the 1999/2000 "Moby Dick" tour is here (who knows if we'll ever see a Moby Dick album, sigh...). There is a blurb on the last page of the booklet that says "LA's Nonesuch Record debut will be in Spring 2001" (yeah right, their website said it would be at the end of 1999 and that didn't happen so...), and it gives the official LA website as the "Homepage Of The Brave" on the Georgia Tech site instead of the "official" site at laurieanderson.com. With that kind of concise marketing luck it'll be the year 3888 before Laurie can make a buck from "Moby Dick", but hey. The booklet alone is a good retrospect on Laurie's career and even mentions Lou Reed as Laurie's romantic interest since 1992. This album also addresses something peculiar to LA: I think that many of her fans discover her late in life and then scramble to find all of her back albums and books. Since much of her work was often produced in limited quantities, some of that material is now highly collectable. If you are just turning on to Laurie Anderson, this may be the perfect place to start. If, like me, you don't really want to carry your prize LA CD's in the car with you for fear of damage, this is a good substitute; plus the cuts have been remastered and I think they sound great. If you want something fresh and new from LA, I'd try praying for her new record company to get a grip. Otherwise I give this album five stars because it's vintage Laurie Anderson in a nice concise package. Now I want the matching DVD.. 
From the conductors to the principal singers to the chorus, this recording of Lucia is without a doubt the must-have of all Lucias both for the reason of musicality, good taste, good music, and great singers. Donizetti himself could never have seen a better cast arranged for his tragic opera! To have an enormous voice (and please understand that this enormous voice is capable of handling coloratura passages just like any light coloratura could) sing Lucia is a phenomenon, and to have the likes of a great tragic artist such as Maria Callas singing a part which has been the playground of most coloratura lights is simply mind-blowing! Her keen sense of drama is evident in this Lucia, as she performs the madscene with a certain kind of drama never seen in any performance of Lucia before and after her career. Not even the fabled Dame Joan performances could match up with the beauty and the drama of this Lucia di Lammermoor. Lacking a good sense of drama and tragedy, Dame Joan only comes close the the accuracy of the score with her embellishments. Callas had so much more to offer to the role. The madness, the tragedy, all of it is so heartfelt in her singing. Of course, Lucia isn't simply a soprano's opera. Let us not forget the tenor who plays the part of Edgardo, who, if it were not for the high demand of a great many jealous sopranos in the past, would have shone as the star in this opera. Giuseppe di Stefano, a tenor with a great voice with an equally great dramatic capability, brought the part a human side which could not be heart from Pavarotti's belching. And Tito Gobbi, who else could have matched such a great baritone? No one!!! He was the ultimatum of the dramatic villain. Of course, we must not forget the efforts of the great Tullio Serafin, the most talented of all the known bel canto conductors during the age of recording technology. I recomment this recording to anyone who wants to hear a TRUE Lucia sung with a passion 
Depending on your ears, the early works on this recording will be either complete madness, or trance-like nirvana. My hunch is that many people will vote for the former, at least at first, before Reich's inventive grip helps you to perceive sounds in a way that perhaps you hadn't before. In any case, the works here are given terrific performances. "Come Out" features the taped voice of a young black man arrested for murder, who had to squeeze his bruises so that some of the blood would "come out" to show the police he was injured. From the man's taped speech, Reich extracts the phrase "come out to show them" and repeats it dozens and dozens of times, electronically altering it so that it slowly shifts in emphasis, tone and weight. It is a mesmerizing experience. Similarly, in "It's Gonna Rain," which uses the voice of a fiery preacher named Brother Walter, Reich repeats the title phrase hundreds of times, and as the work progresses the words gradually dissolve into a huge wall of sound that is indistinguishable from its origins. The most accessible work for most people will probably be "Clapping Music," a short, percussive study for two people well, clapping. The means are simple, but the result is much more complex. Reich explores different rhythmic patterns, and this piece, like the others, helps provide crucial understanding of some of his later, more complex works like "Drumming" or "Different Trains." "Piano Phase" was written in 1967, for two pianists who begin playing the same figure in unison, before one pianist speeds up slightly. The unison changes into what at first sounds like an echo, but settles into a sort of chugging harmony as the pianist continues to pull ahead. Listeners who are restless when confronted with the composer's stark "Violin Phase" (employing a similar technique) might enjoy the two-piano timbre here a bit more. I wish I could say that everyone would like this recording, but it just is not so. Although I find these pieces completely fascinating, they do require a good bit of patience, not to mention a willingness to be immersed in a rather stark and uncompromising sound world. Those who came to Reich through "18 Musicians," "Different Trains," or some of his latest compositions that incorporate video, may be left completely in the dark by these early pieces. But for those interested in Reich, or in trends in twentieth-century music, at least one hearing of this amazing recording could be considered almost essential 
Warning, this is a strange CD. It's not going to fit everyone's taste, but if you are the type that likes to explore, or extremely bored with POP music, then this is the CD for you. This was created recorded before the computer age, yet deals with the process of the computer age. Back then some Classical Experimenters used tape loops to created multi layered repetitions of rhythm melody. I believe the high light is "It's Gonna Rain" from a recording of a Pentecosta street preacher yelling about Noah's flood. The words "Its Gonna Rain" become rhythm with something like: "Its Its, Its Gonna Its Gonna, Gonna Gonna, Gonna Rain Gonna Rain, Rain Rain...then the piece adds layers of layers of the sermon until it becomes a vast sound effect. Believe it or not I played "It's Gonna Rain" during a Performance Art piece called "Noah's Art" where I gave out water balloons pistols to an audience while reading then acting out the 10 commandants. The Tape loop was used to drive everyone into a frenzy to drown me with water. It Worked. Thanks Steve 
The complete, complete control of the music on this cd feels so great to listen to. In the pieces with phased tapes of people talking, the voice is only discernible as a voice for the beginning, then the 2 tapes out of phase become just sounds that you can pick the words out of maybe if you really try. You know his earliest phase music was made by playing the same recording of someone talking on 2 tapes &amp; speeding up one of the tapes so they each play [almost] the same thing at different times, &amp; what more emerges between them is intense. With instrumental phase music, one of the performers periodically jumps a beat ahead while repeating the same musical phrase as the other performer. One of Reich's favorite observations of phase music is that in pure phase music the composer doesn't know anything about where the music will go that the listener doesn't know. The phase pieces on this cd are so wild. They feel so unsettling in how quasi-post-futuristic they are &amp; in the topics of the spoken phase pieces, opening a bruise to be bleeding to be allowed medical attention &amp; the preaching of Brother Walter on the street in San Francisco; but also feel very comfortable in the complete control. Not far into Reich's career, he stopped making phase music. With a great sampling of the phase music he did, this is essential Reich 
These 'early' works (written in the composer's 30s) already reveal Steve Reich as a musician of the future, dragging classical music out of its serialist rut, his rhythmic loops paving the way for popular dance forms, such as techno and drum'n'bass. But this forward-looking was firmly rooted in the past. 'Piano Phase', 20 minutes of duelling pianos repeating the same line, plays like a Bach fugue stuck on a groove, reminding us that great Western music has always been abstract and austere, an apotheosis of geometric patterns. Like the other pieces on this CD, the track seems merely repetitive on a first listen, but patient exploration unearths all manner of subtle variations, tempo changes, curious emphases, making for an unexpectedly thrilling listening experience. 'Come Out' and 'It's Gonna Rain' are weird preludes and fugues, a spoken word sample as the theme which is looped, distorted, imperceptibly reworked in the pieces themselves. 'It's Gonna Rain', especially, is a post-modern spiritual, the dogma of the sample's preacher fragmented, the certainty of his declamations subjected to doubt and impermenance, but the timeless humanity of his gospel fervour ringingly affirmed, defying the reproducing machine. This trick would be purloined later by Moby and Fatboy Slim, to lesser effect 
Yes this is a wonderful album as the other's have said, very innovative and groundbreaking. The fact that Reich was so far ahead of his time with this and given the lousy recording capabilities of the 60's this disk is simply amazing. However people not used to it should take it in small doses. The repetitive nature and the effects the voices make create and very terrifying sound one that is truly creepy. The second part of "It's Gonna Rain" is a prime example of it. Took a few friends and me about 3 tries to be able to listen to the entire piece in one sitting it's so disturbing. But the more you hear it the more the beauty comes out and you love it more and more. Soon you can pop this in and enjoy every bit of every piece straight through and drive anyone else in the area batty. Still "Piano Phase" is the best piece on the album, wonderfully hypnotic and addictive it will play tricks on your ears and mind after about 17 min or so the complexities and layering get to the point you hear things that aren't there quite an interesting effect. This album and anything by Reich I highly recommend but only for those who are musically open-minded and enjoy the stranger and off the wall aspect of music and life 
I've been listening to the Costes collection for a couple of years now! I simply love them all (except for the latest Costes #8 which I think is quite a disappointment)! Every album in this series (before Costes 8) has it's own magic. There are some which are better than others, but as a whole they are all great albums, filled with really cool, sensual music in an amazing variety of styles! I've just bought Hotel Costes 7 and it turned out to be another great album from this series! A fantastic collection of music in the same great tradition of previous Costes releases! If I were to rate the Hotel Costes series starting with my favourite one, it would be something like this: 1.-"quatre" (the 4th) 2.-"la suite" (the 2nd) 3.-"sept" (the 7th) 4.-"5" (the 5th) 5.-"6" (the 6th) 6.-"etage 3" (the 3rd) 7.-"Costes" (the 1st) 8.-"8" (the 8th) ...a very distant 8th place.. 
Hotel Costes 1 and 2 where the best presentation gifted DJ Poumpougnac could offer, 3 was different, more dance floor remixes, but then 4, 5 and 6 where probably an exploration of the unknown which, frankly, didn't reach the standards. Now, with Sept, he definitely reached his past, and has presented a varied, risky but amazing collection of songs that only he could offer. He has been in my home city recently (Madrid, Spain), and offered quite a horrible concert, but Sept is amazing. Rodney Hunters is probably one of the best tracks of all his collection, danceable but complex and non-tireable, track 7 is one of the best "batucadas" I've ever heard, and track 10 is an incredible sticky track you think you'0ve heard many times before. The rest, well fill in tracks, different, high quality down and high tempo that will keep you listening over and over again. The only fault, the mix between the songs is not too good, as it was in Hotel Costes 3 
Was a present for my daughter, she's in her 30's and loves lounge music for entertaining at home. Not too loud but smooth grooves that are acceptable and appreciated even by seniors 
Costes continues to release nice lounge music. Except the new HC 7 contains some already released material, i.e. a track from Richest Man in Babylon. Huh? Stephane Pomp. selected a few cool tracks like Dolphin Boy's. But, there are weird lame selections like the future version of Sounds of Silence? Simon and Garfunkel deserve more than this. That track was really odd and fell flat. I was just wondering? Out of all the great soul and jazz of the sixties and seventies that todays artists can draw from for new inspiration, why chose a pop standard to massacre? So, costes continues with some light lounge tracks. I guess the old adage, "If it ain't broke don't fix it," also applies to these DJs in France. But come on, even the folks at Naked Music realized they needed to change things up a bit. Live a little Costes. Recently I came across a new album of all french artists called Paris Under A Groove. I like the new funky beats and hip hop fusion, jazz, deep house, and soul on Paris Under A Groove. This album,as described in the liner notes, only showcases artists from Paris and the French country side. These new artists are taking the sounds of vintage funk,and incorporating a new electronica sound around it. Also, this album includes a rare unreleased track from St Germain. This is the kind of stuff to last a lifetime. The Light fluffy lounge material on Costes lingers for a moment then fits nicely into an elevator mix. 4 stars for the costes idea. 
In a genre that deteriorates as they age, Hotel Costes is still interesting and relevant. Cafe del Mar and Buddha Bar CD's turned to crap so save your money on them. Costes endures. Every track here is a pleasure, with not a touch of elevator muzak. Add it to your collection. 
I suppose it all comes down to personal taste, and after all, we are talking about the master of the genre, but I would have to give the first 8 tracks a 3 rating and the last 8 the usual Costes 5 rating. Trouble is, if I was in the club and lasted to #8, I think that track alone would get me out of my seat and off to another club...What was he thinking??? Is it still worth buying? Of course !! 
this cd sees the crr's change direction. they've changed so much they no longer sound like the same group. this has a lot to do with the departure of daniel wylie. when he left the group, the band were left with inferior songwriting and now lack direction. they sound like third grade u2 and that's no lie. not even one song on this cd can save it. i'll give 'emptiness' pass marks but only because it's best in very bad company. if you expect to hear the same sound as the classic 'enjoy the melodic sunshine', you will be major disappointed. this record can't hold a candle to 'enjoy'. so it's major, major, disappointment 
Two riders have ridden off into the sunset since the release of Enjoy the melodic sunshine. One of them, Daniel Wylie, has since carved out a solo career thru three solo albums that are a match for that beautiful record. Who knows what happened to the other guy, but what is clear is that the three remaining riders are heading for anonymous oblivion with this awful record. Someone must've told them it would be a good idea to impersonate early U2 but whoever it was forgot to tell them you need to add great songs to the mix for it to work. This album lacks good songs. The averageness of the material is saddeningly frightening. A band who was king of the hill are now licking the souls of the good bands. I'm only hearing one great song. Emptiness is that one sole cracker and shows up the rest of the toons for what they are. Sub standard. I can't believe what I'm reading on here when others compared a coupla the toons to the Beatles. Gulp! You got to be joking. You're reading like a marketing person for the band in disguise. I know we all hear it our own way, so I'd say try to hear the record before you part with your cash. 
I liked "Enjoy The Melodic Sushine", and was bummed when I heard the band would go on without their singer and primary songwriter. It turns out, this band is miles beyond what they were with Daniel Wiley. Now the songs are no longer frivilous faux hippy pop, which was entertaining, but not something I ever took very seriously. This album is utterly fantastic. "When You Come Around" is mind-blowing and with the exception of "Just A Satelite" which is not that great, every track is amazing. It's like the Oasis album I've always been waiting for, with hints of Americana (ie. Wilco, Jayhawks, Bob Dylan). The songs a precisely written, with some of the most outstanding melodys and chord structures I've heard in a long time. These are songs that you'll want to listen to over and over. Buy it, even at the import price 
The cd is a great change for CRR...they stay true to who they are, yet give fans a new sound to love. Great cd...I highly recommend it 
There's no way to summarize Herbie Hancock's four and a half decades as a recording artist in two discs. Nonetheless, this is a valid overview for those who have only dipped occasionally into his thick catalog. Because Herbie has dabbled in and helped to invent so many different facets of the jazz spectrum, the song-to-song segues can be jolting. But every one of the twenty tracks chosen for this compilation is worthwhile: from the original "Watermelon Man" through the modal "Maiden Voyage," the space-age "Hidden Shadows," the jazz-funk masterpiece "Chameleon" and the Stevie Wonder-ful "St. Louis Blues." One can quibble with what's left off--I'd love to have a chance to assemble my own version of the "essential Herbie"--but even the lesser known latter-day material is interesting and invigorating. To really get to this man's essence, you need whole albums from the various phases of his career, but for a quick aperitif, this is very tasty.

The film soundtrack to DAMN YANKEES is similar but certainly quite inferior to the peerless 1955 original Broadway cast album. The Warner Bros. film brought the entire original cast to reprise their roles (with the exception of Stephen Douglass who was replaced by Tab Hunter, who provided the marquee-value for the box office). Gwen Verdon's performance of Lola is perhaps even better here than on the 1955 OBC; she belts the role a little better and on the whole her singing is stronger here. Shannon Bolin gets a new song "There's Something About an Empty Chair" which isn't really memorable. Rae Allen once again knocks `em dead with "Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, MO", and Ray Walston's performance of Mr Applegate is priceless. Tab Hunter is only average in his singing as the younger Joe Hardy. The remastering of this album is quite fine; there is some scratch and surface-hiss, but nothing too-obtrusive. Very nice for the price 
This is absolutely one of my favorite CD's in the entire world. First, let's talk about the differences between it and the Broadway CD. The Broadway recording contains two absolutely lovely songs, "A Man Doesn't Know" and "Near To You", and also the hilarious "The Game." These three were cut from the movie and replaced by "There's Something About An Empty Chair" (The only Damn Yankees song I cannot stand... it's just not fun nor pretty...). Otherwise, with a few changes in the length and phrasing of "A Little Brains, A Little Talent", "Whatever Lola Wants", and "Who's Got The Pain"... it's no different than the Broadway CD. However, I LIKE this CD more than the Broadway CD. I don't know why... the background music just sounds better to me over all, and Gwen Verdon actually SOUNDS like herself. Don't get me wrong, I own the Broadway CD also and I LOVE IT, but if you're debating, this is definitely the way to go (unless one of the cut songs is your favorite). After all, there's nothing like hearing the phrases "Hallo Joe!" and "ERP!" now is there? :o 
This CD is an exact replica of the 1958 LP. My only regret is the fact that they should have re-issued the original tracks with the underscoring and full dance orchestrations. As it stands, this is a very enjoyable listening experience with "A Little Brains, A Little Talent" (Verdon) being the show's standout number 
This soundtrack of the 1958 film version of the Adler-Ross Broadway hit "Damn Yankees" really makes me wish I could get my hands on a copy of the film itself. This great score is very well-represented by the entire cast, almost all of it directly from the original Broadway company. Dynamic readings from the baseball players and Rae Allen as the reporter in "Heart" and "Shoeless Joe," Ray Walston recreating his Tony-winning role as Mr. Applegate in "Those Were the Good Old Days," and especially the great Gwen Verdon, also recreating her Tony-winning, starmaking role of Lola. Though she was probably a better dancer than a singer, Verdon makes up for it with her incredible energy and zest. (And I bet nobody noticed her singing skills in the film, as I expect she was dancing too well for them to even care) From "A Little Brains, A Little Talent" to her famous "Whatever Lola Wants" seduction to "Who's Got the Pain," which also features her choreographer and later husband, Bob Fosse, Verdon is wonderful. And the shows two ballads, "Goodbye, Old Girl" and "There's Something About An Empty Chair" (The last written especially for the film) are pretty good, too. Definitly worth a look 
With hesitation I rented Damn Yankees, being that I hate baseball and everything associated with it. However, this film really is about something much different...and the soundtrack really captures the enchantment of this story...about how our dreams are the figments of our realities. And Gwen Verdon...sheeee-it 
I played my original LP of this soundtrack until it wore out. This is one of the best soundtracks ever recorded.... if you've never heard it before, you have a treat in store 
This is a really good album. The songs are simply fantastic and easy to be listened. Good work by these guys. Hopefully their commitment in the concerts is as good as their CDs 
Maroon5's debut album Songs About Jane is still a major sucess despite being close to three years old. The songs include: Harder to Breathe: Very upbeat song, one of my favorite, more rock and roll feel to it that the others. only track that has profanity (an f-bomb in the intro) This Love: The first single and the song that introduced me to this wonderful CD and the band behind it. Shiver: Short song, kinda risque but has a good beat She Will Be Loved: What i consider to be kind of a "chick song", still good but not really my type of track. Tangled: Another great song with a good beat and lyrics another more edgy R song The Sun: Follows more on the R vibe and a little bit of spoken word mixed with a simple beat Must Get Out: Another uplifting kinda song that kinda grabs more soulfully than by the ear. Sunday Morning: Another one of my favorites and the single released after "This Love". Secret: Follows the suit of "The Sun" with the R, but alot more smooth and slow jam-y. Through with You: Probably the track they rocked out on the most. My faavorite on the album. dubbed a great break-up song. Not Coming Home: one of my least favorites on the album. Swetest Goodbye: another chick song but i actually like this one alot. another inspirational track. All around i give this CD an A. Look out for their next CD thhat comes out later this Fall!! 
Songs About Jane is a unique blend of rock, pop, soul, R, and funk. It's got everything which sets it apart from that other stuff on the radio. The sexy, souful lyrics really grab you, "Cool these engines, calm these jets, I ask you how hot can it get." I don't know if I have a favorite song because I love the entire CD, although "Sunday Morning, Secret, The Sun, Harder to Breathe, Not Coming Home and Sweetest Goodbye stand out. I cannot get enough of this album and I've been listening to it for awhile... 
I'm a confirmed baby-boomer and usually buy only 60's and 70's music, but after I got XM radio in my new pickup truck I started hearing a few newer songs that I liked and almost all of them were sung by "Maroon 5". I didn't even know who they were. I do now! "Songs About Jane" is a great CD for playing over and over on a long drive or a boring commute. It will keep your foot tapping and (weather permitting) you can roll down the window and slap the side of your door! There are a couple of soft jazzy ballads mixed in to get your heart rate back down to normal. The beat is usually relentless, the chord and key shifts beautiful and often unexpected, and the high vocal harmonies (wish there were more of them) are as precise as Lennon-McCartney or Heart. Each week, a different song from this CD will find its way into your subconcious and refuse to leave! OK, so a few of the songs do have a "Motown" aura to them...after Motown got mowed-down by rap, we need someone to revive the original Motown sound anyway. Way to go Maroon 5 -- there is some hope for the music of the "X" (or is it "Y"?) generation 
What can I say about "Songs about Jane"? This album constantly surprises me by how much I can listen to it. Every song has a unique and appealing feel to it. Adam Levine has an amazingly sexy voice that sounds like a smooth drink going down. My favourite songs on this album are: Sunday Morning, The Sun, Secret, Sweetest Goodbye and Not coming Home. There are also the radio favourites: She will be Loved, Harder to breathe and This Love. Maroon 5 manages to cover a variety of genres in this ablum: R'n'B, Funk, Blues and Pop, therefore feeding most tastes in one album. I would recommend this album to anyone I know and have given it as a gift many times. 
This type of music is like a blister on the brain. You can't get rid of it and it is irritating. Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played. And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word. Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists 
Those who listen to Maroon 5 are highly likely to be severely mentally handicapped. thus far it is unknown whether being handicapped caused one to listen to Maroon 5 or whether listening to Maroon 5 causes one to be handicapped. mostly likely a little of both 
I'd almost given up on Country music over the past five years. It seems like all I hear is tired old retreads being trotted out as "the latest thing," but still a few artists like Brian McComas allow me to hold out hope. Back Up Again is the follow up to his terrific debut CD, and though it was a long wait, it was worth it. McComas is genuine. He has energy and feeling. I can't say that every single song is great, but I've never heard a CD (including greatest hits CDs) of any genre in which every single song is great, but there is a lot of good material here. This CD goes hand in hand with the debut without attempting to copy it. This is the guy, and I think he will be for many years to come 
Brian McComas's self-titled debut album was a nice little slice of pop-country; it didn't take itself too seriously (most of the time), and featured McComas's light-hearted, catchy vocals. However, the album featured very little of his own songwriting; only four of the songs were self-penned. This is probably the reason BACK UP AGAIN surpasses its predecessor: all but one of the songs were either written or co-written by McComas, who is indeed a talented songwriter--he knows what radio listeners want to hear, but manages to write songs that aren't like the fluff that get played every second. His songs feature both catchy choruses and thoughtful lyrics; the smooth--but not over-done--production seems perfect for radio...too bad it probably won't get played. Because this exactly the kind of smart, borderline-edgy music that radio needs. BACK UP AGAIN is definitely a step up for this talented singer/songwriter 
My 22 month old daughter absoultely loves this cd. She asks for it all the time and when "I'm Different" or the "swim song" come on she dances around and sings along. 
The CD was in great condition, as described, and it arrived pretty quickly after I placed my order. Thank you, I would totally purchase from this seller again 
When the kids start nagging in the car, I pop this CD in and the nags stop while the giggles and singing along start. Both my 18 MO daughter and my 3.5 year old son love it. My son loves to sing along with I"m different, Bottom of the Sea and Everybody Came and he sings "I'm different, different" all over the house on his own. I just love all of it and esp the Meow Meow song. This is great for lovers of modern rock and alternative pop. I guess you would be disappointed if you want mainstream stuff. I'd also like to recommend the Beatles Songs for Kids CD - I never would have thought that Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da would be such a hit with kids 
I'm so in love with this CD and so are my kids. They are 3 and 5 y.o. and we all enjoy it equally. I prefer this one to the first For the Kids because it is quirkier and less typically "children's music". My kids love to sing the song "I'm Different" and they think the telephone song is knee-slappingly hilarious. My favorite is "Starfish Coffee". Our other favorite CD is John Lithgow's "Singin' in the Bathtub" 
Robyn Hitchcock on a kids cd? How could it be bad. Very nice music that is not boring for adults 
We are disappointed with this album. We loved the first For the Kids album, but this one is boring boring boring. My kids age 2 and 4 do not like it because there are no silly or funny songs like the first one. 
This would've been a five, but I just can't get into the Rainbow Connection by Jason Mraz. However, the rest of the disc is great. Two highlights: I'm different, which my daughter can't get enough of, and Everybody Came. Buy it, your kids will love it 
I work in a children's bookstore and our customers rely heavily on us for recommendations so the arrival of the follow-up to the supremely successful For the Kids was kind of a big event amongst the staff. Partly because we've listened to the first one so many times that it's always nice to have something new playing in the store, but mainly because we've depended on the first CD as a sure bet for people buying for grandchildren, nieces, nephews, the kid next door, etc, and we knew that this one wouldn't let us down. It's got fun, upbeat tunes and a new slew of voices that we older ones are sure the little ones will love. They repeated the Rainbow Connection which Sarah MacLachlan sang on the first cd for good reason, this song, redone by Jason Mraz, is especially not to be missed (particularly at naptime) 
Echo The Bunnymen were the first "cool" band I fell in love with. The album art is incredible, the name was cool and "strange", and most importantly the music was awesome, from the lyrics to the atmosphere. I love all their work and this one took the longest to get into, but became my favorite, right next to the brilliance of Ocean Rain. Porcupine was my favorite on first listen and Crocodiles is always fun so there is a lot of competition. This is the darkest of the 4 and maybe that is why I love it. It also rocks out as powerfully as any album I own so maybe that is what pushes it over the edge. The CD starts with "Show Of Strength", edgy and powerful, setting you up for a fight with the outside world and personal demons, this song transitions to "With A Hip", a really cool song that carries the flag filling you with a rush of adrenaline. Next is "Over The Wall", a powerful song you can't escape, drawing you into a magical world and not letting you up. The next two songs do let you relax a bit until "Heaven Up Here". This is one of my favorite songs ever. Ian's demons are all exposed and he is giving everything to escape this world while at the same time giving into its dark pleasures. He fails to escape and acknowledges his pain in the truly sad "The Disease". One of the darkest tracks to be written about the futility of life. The Bunnymen aren't afraid to expose the pain of reality and this is another reason this CD is so powerful. This atmosphere builds until "Turquoise Days" where the tension builds to the most incredible adrenalin rush of all time recorded on CD where you feel like you can grab the world by the balls and crush it. The CD than lets up a bit allowing the listener go to a world where we must take pleasure in the simple things to find any comfort at all in "All I Want". A work of genius 
This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw. After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me. Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you. It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache. If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding. 
from a life long fan of music and the bunnymen,this album has that special element that only great art, poetry and sound can capture,,,put them together and you have a timeless piece,,,,good to see so many fans from across the water recognising this great album,,,nice one Mac.. 
One review of another Bunny disc described this one as messy. My question is: What were you listening to--a bad bootleg of Heaven Up Here? This is possibly the greatest album ever made. Of course, I'm prejudiced being a Bunnymen fan and all but it's as close to perfect as any album ever released by any artist period. Here's a tip, turn off all your lights in your home and listen to this album in the dark and then tell me it isn't magical. That voice of Ian McCulloch is in top form and the guitar shards slashed out by Will Sergeant esp. on Heaven Up Here are intense, manic and beautiful all at the same time 
After their raw, exuberant debut album "Crocodiles", Echo the Bunnymen went back to the drawing board. They came back with "Heaven Up Here," and from the very first listen it's clear that this record is chock full of Ideas, man. It sounds a lot like four [possibly] naive young men trying to deconstruct rock as they saw it in the UK in the early 80's: all sleek, chic, and retro-redundant. Punk arrived in 1975/76 to teach the dinosaurs a lesson, and while it quickly became a parody of itself, the movement galvanized the efforts (and turned the mental/emotional/spiritual wheels) of thousands of would-be musicians. The Bunnymen, it would seem, took punk's lessons to heart, and although they dispensed of its machinations early in their career, "Heaven Up Here" could arguably be termed the best punk-influenced record ever made. While some of the sounds on the record seem dated and cliched by today's standards, it's important to listen to this music with one's mind attuned to the context of the Times in which it was released. Guitars shimmer and glisten like raindrops falling into puddles, as the bass churns out hypnotic Nuggets/Krautrock-inspired riffs and the drums pound out cymbal-less, tribal rhythms. And then you notice the Voice: It soars, dives, drives, and fights with the music, sometimes all in the course of a single song. This Voice drips with drama and pathos, delivering cryptic lyrics that draw you into a strange internal logic that actually begins to make a lot of sense after awhile. After thirty listens, one begins to think, "Aha! This song really DOES mean something!" Yes, you should probably buy this album. And once you do, remember this Tip: "Heaven Up Here" actually sounds even better on an overcast, rainy day 
Simply the best rock album of all time. Move over Led Zeppelin 
"Under the Covers" is a solid album covering '60s and '70s pop tunes. Sweet and Hoffs have the talent and production chops to put together convincing remakes of some well known songsand some exciting obscurities. Mostly it works well, although Sweet should never again attempt early-period Beach Boys (he just can't sing up there effectively). The album is more a celebration of Sweet and Hoff's great taste (and Sweet's guitar prowess) than an album with anything urgent or fresh to say. It's a pleasant listen and a good way of getting lots of great tunes in one place. But it doesn't really do anything all that innovative or moving 
When I first bought this cd, upon its release, I was pretty disappointed. Nothing special, and I didn't know several of the songs that were covered here. After some research for original versions, and repeated listens, I have changed my mind. A few of the songs, are pretty much carbons of the originals, but a few, have been turned into pure pop bliss. Stand out cuts are : Care of cell 44, Its all over now Baby Blue, and Sunday Morning. Also, Alone again or, is very good, but fairly true to the original. The 2 songs that keep me from giving this 4 stars, instead of 3, are Run To Me, and Monday Monday. To me, the covers seem lacking of something, that the originals have (and so many people seem to cover the Bee Gees Classic, with poor or mediocre results). If you have it, and threw it aside after a listen, give it another chance. If you haven't purchased, and are looking for good pop rock (And you KNOW you can't find it on the radio, lol), give this cd a few spins 
Hoffs and Matthew Sweet are clearly having a whopping good time with this album of covers from the 60's which includes well-known and not so well-known songs. The song selection offers an intriguing mixing of obvious choices such as "Monday, Monday" with surprises like the Beatles' rarely played guitar masterpiece, "And Your Bird Can Sing." The arrangments are slavish to the originals, but the material is played and sung with more than enough gusto to compensate for the lack of originality. Hoffs' voice shows a surprising vigor not evident in her Bangles work, especially on "Different Drum" on which she goes toe-to-toe with the original version by the Stone Ponys featuring the classic vocal from a young Linda Ronstadt (although Hoffs' version does lack the charm of the distinctive Southern twang of Ronstadt's voice). Hoffs' voice is well complimented by Sweets', and the two provide some surprising harmonizing on songs like "Different Drum. This is a feel good album if there ever was one and as such it delivers the goods 
If you love Susanna Hoff's wonderfully sugary voice, then this is for you. While I enjoyed the Bangles' last effort, "Doll Revolution," there was not enough Susanna for me -- could there ever be! This is not to downplay the vocal and instrumental offerings of the other side of Sugar, Matthew Sweet -- indeed, Sweet adds some much needed punch that I think was lacking from Susanna's solo efforts. This is a true team effort. Great material and a joy to listen to, over and over 
Matthew Sweet by himself is good. "Girlfriend" is a classic cd. Suzanna Hoff is many years past her prime and the Bangles were...okay. This cd is bad. The versions are week and detract from the original songs. Sweet and Hoffs have no synergy. Why are they even together? They add nothing to these songs and simply sound like a wedding band doing covers. Did you see them on the talk shows (Conan, Leno). They were horrible! If Matthew Sweet doesn't lose weight, he may not be able to ever get a "Girlfriend". This seems like a desperate attempt to make money. A better covers cd is the Def Leopard one 
Mainly because Johnny Cash's "American V" is so damn sad. This is a fun, bright CD to listen to, perfect for popping into your car CD player to make the commuting miles fly by. If you're looking for something deeply meaningful or definitive re-interpretations of the songs, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're looking for enjoyable cover songs, you won't be. The harmonies are sweet, no pun intended. Both Susanna and Matthew do a great job on their respective lead vocals, and the instrumentation (mostly by Sweet) is almost letter-perfect to the originals. Matthew Sweet does an amazingly convincing job of covering a wide range of vocal styles, from Neil Young to Brian Wilson. And Susanna Hoffs is Susanna Hoffs. Enough said. The songs range from those we know by heart to some that are more obscure, but there isn't a bad one in the bunch. The more you listen to them, the more they grow on you. This one is in heavy rotation on my CD player, and I really hope that there will be a Volume 2, because I'll be out there to buy it 
What do you get when you take two power-pop masters and put them in a room. A great pop record celebrating some sweet music. Matthew Sweet has always been a sucker for a good cover it seems. He's turned up on more comps than anyone I know. Under The Covers has been in constant rotation in my car for the past two weeks. Some of my favorite tracks are "Warmth Of The Sun", "Baby Blue", "Sunday Morning", and by far the most favorite track is The Bee Gees "Run to Me". Susanna and Matthew harmonize so beautifully on this track. It gives me chills. and I have to say Susanna Hoffs is HOTTER than ever! Doesn't she age? She's the sexiest woman in rock-n-roll. By the way, check out High School Reunion - a tribute to those great 80's films! Matthew covers Tom Petty's classic "American Girl" on this CD comp. The guy just doesn't stop. When's Austin Power #4 coming out??? I need more Matthew in the movies. LO 
I am a huge fan of power pop with a little twang. I strongly recommend that you check out the following: 1) Teenage Symphonies To God by The Velvet Crush 2) Papa Nez: A Loose Salute To The Work Of Michael Nesmith by Various Artists 3) Nashville by Josh Rouse 
I don't write alot of reviews. But you guys really should check this album. This album can be reviewed in one word: Great! The production, lyrics, flow are all great. This album rates with the true hiphop classics like: Nas - Illmatic Dr Dre - The Chronic Dr Dre - 2001 Mobb Deep - Hell On Earth Tupac - Me Against the world Snoop Dogg - Doggystyle So get yourself a copy very fast!! Album Highlights: Almost every song is great 
This CD is packed with beats that are spectacular, lyrics that are amazing and great flow with them. There is not a weak song on the CD, and almost every song (if not every one) is a straight classic. I don't see any flaws with this CD at all, and I am sure that you will love it if you pick it up as well 
After two successful collaboration-projects, I'm talkin' `bout Black Star and Reflection Eternal of course, Talib decided to go solo on this one. The first two singles where nice and the Brooklyn rapper really showed his universality, on this one. On Quality he keeps impressing, with manifoldly and exciting song-material and well written lyrics. Quality is a perfect title, and Kweli picked out some great beats. Kanye West did three bangers, "Good To You", "Guerilla Monsoon Rap" and "Get By". On "Get By", West used a Nina Simone sample, which gives the song a nice, but at the same time a rough feel. Kweli's verses fits the beat perfectly. Other producers involved are MegaHertz, Avatollah, J Dilla and DJ Scratch which all contributed with nice productions. The MegaHertz produced "Gun Music" which is a fun element, but to be honest it fits better for the guests, Cocoa Brovaz rather than Kweli. "Shock Body" (Produced by DJ Scratch) are also funny, with a pompous hornline, and J Dilla found a great melody for "Where Do We Go". But, nothing beats Kanye West three instrumentals. Talib Kweli are under ever development, and writes very good now. He can be political committed, see "The Proud". He can be introspective, see "Joy" or he can plain and simple just spit, see "Guerilla Monsoon Rap". Further on he shows a more complex flow than earlier. He really outdid himself this time. This is a quality album for the choosy ones out there. Great hip-hop. Be sure to pick it up, if you haven't. 
Many hip-hop heads have very high expectations for Talib Kweli. He's one of those unique, special artists who come along very rarely. You may have heard of this talented emcee from several areas. The stunning "Train of Thought" album was the end result of his collaboration with DJ Hi-Tek under the moniker Reflection Eternal. He also teamed up with fellow `Native Tounge' emcee Mos Def and released one of hip-hop's most recently stunning albums, "Black Star". Add to these critically acclaimed works Kweli's contributions to respected projects like the Lyricist Lounge and Rawkus Record's Soundbombing series and it is not difficult to understand quite why there are such high expectations for this Brooklyn-born artist. So the furore over Kweli's debut "Quality", released in early November, 2002, is natural. For the project Kweli recruited a high-class guest list of rap artists to help him succeed the hype, and unusually ditched Hi-Tek as his main producer instead opting for donations from producers like DJ Scratch, Kanye West, DJ Quik and Ayatollah.

Quality is technically Talib Kweli's first solo album, although his collaboration with DJ Hi-Tek, Train of Thought, was his real coming out party. The title (and thank God he avoided the obvious and corny "Kweli-ty" or some such thing) is apt. Kweli delivers what we have come to expect from his releases; quality rhymes, quality production and quality ideals. Lyrically, especially, Talib gives us more than his share of innovative metaphors, food for thought and just plain intelligence. He doesn't have the presence of his intellectual peers (Black Thought, GZA, Common, etc.), much less more mainstream MCs like Method Man or Jay Z, but he seems to feverishly try to compensate by spitting 100% premium rhymes. And it works. There is no question in my mind he is one of the top 3 rappers alive today. When he concludes that "...all you really need is love" in "Get By", he follows that contention with a verse about John Lennon and the Beatles. This type of lyrical cohesion can be found all over the album, and the astute listener is rewarded with repeat listens. The rhymes are far from bookish, however. In fact, they are laid out plainly and annunciated perfectly. It's just that there is such a wealth of information to digest, you can't pick it up all at once (as opposed to a group like Wutang, who's cryptic lines require multiple visitations to decipher because they are obscure and often follow their own mythology and vocabulary). Still, this is not a classic. The consistency is commendable, but you don't walk away saying "Wow..." As I stated before, this is much what we've come to expect from Kweli. That's not to say that there aren't highlights. Samples of Nina Simone's "Sinnerman" propel the up-lifting "Get By", providing a hot single. Black Thought and Pharaohe Monch join in to trade choice battle raps over a Kanye West-produced beat on "Guerilla Monsoon Rap". The exuberance and sincerity of "Joy", a tribute to the births of Talib's two children, is enough to choke me up now that I've watched my own daughter born. And the most compellingly smooth and seductive track, "Talk to You (Lil' Darlin')" is a brilliant cover, just like Reflection Eternal's "For Women". The rest of the tracks are all consistent, with the exception of "Gun Music", which just doesn't ever gel, and the out-of-place DJ Quik verse on "Put It in the Air". Thematically, Quality ranges from the angry politics of "The Proud" (featuring the perfect stab at today's White House which has no chance of making this review on Amazon) to the club rap of "Waiting for the DJ" to the witty jabs of Dave Chapelle and Michael Rappaport. Does the production-by-committee approach pale in comparison to the connection of Kweli and Hi-Tek? Yes. Is this material ground-breaking? No. Regardless of those things, does this album make good on its only promise - to provide quality hip-hop? Absolutely. 
Talib Kweli is definitely one of the best rappers alive today (alongside Eminem, OutKast and Mos Def), and although he's not my favorite, I can still recognize that this album is just amazing. It starts off with a hilarious rap-skit by one of my favorite comics ever - Dave Chappelle. From here the second track kicks off the album with style and grace - "Rush" is definitely a great and catchy song with great production, lyrics and vocals. Talib is certainly a great MC and lyricist as he says what needs to be says and everything that he says is always interesting to pay attention to. The production is also very noteworthy - DJ Hi-Tek does most of the album and he definitely does a great job. I don't know how to describe the production side of it, but chances are you'll love it so let's leave it at that. The lyrics are, as I stated before, incredibly interesting, thoughtful, catchy and sometimes quotable - you'll definitely have fun paying attention to them. If you call yourself a hip-hop fan then there's no reason why you shouldn't like "Quality" and his previous album "Reflection Eternal" - I'm not sure if non-rap fans will like it, though. All in all this is highly recommended! Highlights include: the entire album 
Continuing in the fashion of Talib fallin' off. This ish was ultra terrible....................Again............WTF? One of my favorite emcees, making this ish. The single with Bilal (sounds like something you catch on your feet) was terrible. I was truly hurt when I scanned the cd, and there was nothing, and I do mean nothing, to put on the XBOX!!! Again...........WTF? After I sold this "train of thought" back, I knew his albums were ugly not beatiful struggles to listen to from here on out. From the height @ Rawkus to this ish, right down the drain, like the rest of the label. By the way, what are they doin? Why this album sucks: 1) Talib fell da f*ck off 2) It's wack 3) Him and DJ Quik don't mix, and that song was on Soundboming 3 4) Reusing a song from compilation disk 5) Commercial 6) Coaster material 7) Opposite of album title 8) Beats 9) Lyrics 10) Ultra wack as @#$%*^ in all languages Bottom Line: Talib should have taken that cheap muthaph*cka and wiped his @$$ wit it FO, REAL!!!!!!!!!! Peace!!!!!!!! P.S. Amazon won't let me rate it 0 stars 
complacent. conservative. boring. sure everything is in the right place and you can't say it's not well made, but there is no gusto, no fire, no leap of faith or passion or anger. there are no daring ideas, no risks taken on the note-pad NOR the mixing desk. the man is tiptoeing around the studio, crafting a precarious object that is about as fresh as canned tuna. I loved Blackstar, but pretty much every single track on this is a skip. the same with the Beautiful Struggle. 
Man this cd is every thing you could want. The best song is number nine. The beat is cold (another one of kanye west best). But besides that this cd is a must have for a real collectors libary of good music. A must have 
Talib Kweli's true solo album is a classic. After Black Star with Mos Def and the Reflection Eternal with producer Hi-Tek, Kweli steps out and spits lyrics after lyrics. The production by top producers like Kanye West and J Dilla is amazing. There are some classic guest appearances too. Mos Def sings the hook on Joy, The Roots' Black Thought and Pharoahe Monch on Guerilla Monsoon Rap, Res on Where Do We Go, DJ Quik on Put It In The Air, and even Dave Chappelle as Martin Luther King on the intro Keynote Speaker. There's also a track called The Proud which talks about September 11. Favorites include Rush, Get By, Gun Music, Waitin' For The DJ, Joy, Guerilla Monsoon Rap, Put It In The Air, The Proud, Where Do We Go, and Good To You. Highly Highly Recommende 
The futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding. Intelligence is Sexy is a great song, so is Tears Have No Name and Espirit De Corps is outstanding. Every other song is very solid. The vocals have this vibe that no other band creates, the vocals are nearly alien in nature. If you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album. They are kind of, in a weird way, an actualized Voivod for the new century 
look if you have any interest in metal in general this album with please you. Tears Have No Name is by far the stand-out track but the rest is equally superior to your common metal band. they have raw talent and orginallity they put to good work on this album. The vocals don't just growl, he has his melodic moments with is a good change of pace, seeing how metal seems to follow In Flames down that road. Overall 5/5, worth every cent 
this is real industrial black metal, pure genius 
in a world full of "wannabes" it is really cool to find an unique output like ...and oceans. AM GOD is the perfect example of black metal take it into de 21st century. this cd combines the best keys I have heard in a long time (electronica masters) with and incredible, aggressive and very catchy Black Metal. all the compositions are fluid and perfectly executed, so is a cd you can hear in a row. with songs like "intelligence is sexy" and the powerful "tears have no name" this Finns probes there are some fresh air in Black Metal 
In the twenty-first century, most modern music follows the same boring pattern and even concept ideas for music is the same. Prepare to be smacked in the face with this album. Killstar's raspy vocals are excellent, and the symphonics are very good and tastefully done. Although I would agree at not calling them black metal, it is still very well performed. It also sparked my creative side, as I probably have written remarkably deeper after buying this album. Enough said. Buy it now 
I don't usually go for contemporary folk music. That term itself, "folk music," conjures up images of oh-so-sensitive and self-important, delicate artistes. Lame hippy crap in the same bland mold as Dave Matthews, minus the big budget and slick production, that clings to some simple-minded notion of "purity" by virtue of the fact that it's just one painfully earnest dude with an acoustic guitar. To most of these types I'm inclined to say, "Dylan, Goodman or Prine you ain't; get off my lawn and go take a bath." But this, this is something altogether different. Initial listenings sounded like a cool juxtaposition of fingerpicked acoustic guitar and electronic white noise. While that juxtaposition remains central to my interest in "School of the Flower," it grabbed me upon closer inspection how well this guy does both elements. No matter how harsh and grating the noise gets, it never overwhelms the record's peaceful heart; no matter how reassuring the acoustic sounds the noise is never too far away. I've really never heard anything quite like it: at its noisiest, "School of the Flower" posesses an unruffled placididity that evinces a Buddhist sense of detachment in spite of its own internal distractions. Plus, I like the way the vocals are pushed down in the mix and heavily echoed on some songs 
At times trance-like Western ragas, if you will -particularly in "Procession of Cherry Blossom Spirits"- and then simply gorgeous folk -"Lisboa"- which can also erupt into furious electric interludes -"School Of The Flower"- or be enriched with great vocals, like "Thicker Than A Smokey." It is not that easy to describe, nor are Chasny's influences that obvious. I guess this is what happens when someone ventures and succeeds at making original music. If I were to name other people, for the sake of reference, John Fahey would come to mind, yet not so much due to a similar guitar style but because of a common gift for conjuring up a powerful spirit. All in all, an authentic and imaginative new sound, music -thinking of this album's title- that is definitely schooled in the wildness and beauty of flowers 
Truly a head trip of an album. Vivid acoustic melodies repeat on end, sent adrift through dense layers of ambient drones and rolling freeform drums as overdriven squalls of electric guitar erupt haphazardly throughout. Acoustic plucking serves to anchor each of the tracks, providing the listener something familiar to latch on and cling too as otherworldly soundscapes roll in and threaten to wipe out any traditional song elements. In terms of psychedelic presentation, this stuff works to wonderful effect. A few of the tracks are more traditional folk numbers, that though not quite as interesting as the others, provide nice reprieve, with Ben Chasny's (aka Six Organs of Admittance) own sublime vocals supplying much needed human contact. All together, this makes for beautiful, ominous, and assuredly psychedelic folk rock that doesn't require any hallucinogenic supplements to be enjoyed, though that's not to say that they might not be warranted under the right circumstances ;). 
but I never got it - after weeks of delays I was notified that it was not available 
There are very fun children's CDs that won't drive you crazy, but Seame Street CDs are always enjoyable for my little one and myself. Sometimes I have even found myself humming the tunes during the day. (How embarrasing!) 
This cd is a great alternative to watching a DVD or video. My son loves Sesame Street characters but I hate having him sit in front of the tv all day. So, I put on this music and he dances and listens and plays with other toys. Not for the exclusive Elmo lover however, since it features lots of different Sesame Street characters not just Zoe and Elmo as shown on the cover 
Our daughter loves this video tape, so I thought I would get her the CD to listen to in the car and she loves it 
If anyone were to ask me what my favorite album is, I would tell them without any hesitation that it is Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too by the New Radicals. This album really has it all. There is a song for every emotion, and the music and lyrics are a true standout. I never tire of any of the songs on this album and am utterly amazed everytime I hear it. If I could choose only one album to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be it 
William Cooper's review is very thorough ~ and thanks for answering the baffling lack of synchronicity between the printed lyrics and actual lyrics on "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" ~ at least acknowledging it! I've been searching forever for an explanation or response regarding that. I bought the CD for the same song most everyone else did, but my hands-down favorite is "Someday We'll Know...." The only thing that WC may have left out is the "soulful" quality in some of the selections. Darkcloak states, "it's a willful indulgence in pop with some interesting highlights." I agree, and can only add that overall, the CD is brilliant. I can agree with others that at times the lyrical content seems what I would call amusing at best and immature at worst, but I think that if the band had stayed together, they would have easily worked through that - it wouldn't have taken very long. (Similar "mistakes" were made by Prefab Sprout and they've succeeded, imho, in spite of them). While others might call this a one-hit-wonder, I rather think the entire CD is better described as a *magnum opus*. 
Upon hearing the opening single off of this collection back in August 1998 - "You Get What You Give", I was immediately captivated. The piano and other miscellaneous arrangements coupled with an infectious chorus hook combined some of the best elements of what pop had to offer. And all packaged in a late 1990's sheen. I was hooked and have no compunctions stating that this tune stands out as one of the best pop singles I've ever heard pieced together. As for the rest of the recording, I was pleasantly surprised. It was several years later before hearing the rest of "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" owing to a friend of mine who purchased it. I like a good number of tracks on here; "Jehovah Made This Whole Joint For You", "Someday We'll Know", "Crying Like A Church On Monday", among others. I realize some have criticized this as banal, trite, and inferior - but I really beg to differ. To me, it's a willful indulgence in pop with some interesting highlights. Now almost a decade after its release, this disc really shines on as an example of what well crafted eclectic pop goodness could be. A strong recommend. 
Sometimes there is that one song you hear that will make you go out and buy an album. In the case of the song, "You Get What You Give" by the New Radicals, this was a song that completely grabbed me. In many cases, the remainder of the album will disappoint. Such is not the case with the album, "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" - the album that contains the song, "You Get What You Give". What I discovered was an album full of introspective lyrics, great musical arrangements, and even some improvising. The result is a refreshing change from the trend the music industry would take in the late 1990s. The New Radicals are essentially a "project" that was formed by musician and songwriter Gregg Alexander. By a "project", it means that Alexander is the sole core member of the band and none of the other members would be constant members. The two other musicians that could be considered quasi-constant members are guitarist Rusty Anderson and background vocalist Danielle Brisebois (yes the former child star who played Stephanie from the television show "All In the Family"). For all practical purposes this is a solo album and the bulk of the work is Alexander's work. Alexander handles all of the lead vocals a and is the sole songwriter of ten of twelve tracks There are two songs in which Alexander is a co-writer, "You Get What You Give" and "Someday We'll Know" - the latter song was co-written with Brisebois. I found "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" to be a refreshing change of pace to the music landscape. In the late 1990s, Alternative Music began to take over the mainstream music scene. As far as Alternative Rock goes, this was originally a term that was a "catch all" to describe those genres (such as Indie, Grunge, etc) of music that didn't fit into the mainstream. . Eventually this music would become so common that it would become mainstream. In the late 1990s, the common element of many of these sounds was a strong guitar-laden presence. The problem with this sound is that much of it was "cookie-cutter" and would all sound alike. While using a guitar/bass nucleus, Alexander incorporates the use of piano and synthesizers with some funk and soul influences. In particular, I think it's the use of the Piano that really gives this album the edge. Some great examples of piano work are on the soulful, "I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending" and "In Need of a Miracle". Piano isn't the only place where Alexander shines. Songs "Technicolor Lover" and "Jehovah Made This Whole Joint For You" demonstrate a terrific guitar laden style. Both tracks have a terrific mix of both an acoustic style of guitar as well as electric guitars. It is worth noting that Alexander recorded "Technicolor Lover" as a true "solo" effort as he performed all vocals and instruments on the track. The song "You Get What You Give" got a lot of attention - namely in the area of celebrity bashing. Alexander's words at the end of this song launch into a social commentary on everything from health insurance to cloning, big business, as well as celebrity bashing. There are plenty of other great examples of songwriting. On "I Hope I Just Didn't Give Away the Ending", Alexander explores the area of drug abuse. On "Jehovah Made This Whole Joint for You", Alexander explores topics from the Kennedy Assassination to environmental concerns to politics. Alexander explores love in the songs "In Need or a Miracle", "Someday We'll Know", and "Technicolor Lover". I think one thing that makes this album something special is Alexander's use of improvising. Alexander isn't afraid to improvise during the songs and this helps him tackle the wide range of topics he is able to. "You Get What You Give" shows one of the best examples of this when Alexander launches into a social commentary described above. There are many other songs that also show examples of improvising. On "I Hope I didn't Just Give Away the Ending", Alexander changes the serious tone of the song and lightens it up at the end with some humor. In the middle of "Jehovah Made This Whole Joint For You", listen to the presidential sound-clip and Brisebois' powerful segue in which she sings "The first step of a successful revolution is to destroy all competing revolutionaries." On the opening track, "Mother We Just Can't Get Enough", Alexander sings gibberish toward the end of the song - and the amazing thing is that it works. Perhaps the ultimate example of improvising is the title track, "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Lately" in which Alexander basically improvises the entire song. In fact even the lyrics of the song don't match up - let alone fit together. In addition to the songs mentioned above, there are two other good tracks worth mentioning. The opening track "Gotta Stay High" and "Flowers". The liner notes include all of the lyrics to each of the tracks with the exception of "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too". As mentioned, the lyrics that are included do not match up to what the title track song actually is. I'm not sure why Alexander chose to do this, but I guess it fits into the unpredictable trend of this album. One thing that is a bit annoying is that the lyrics are put in upside-down and backwards order format from the front cover. However, this also keeps with the album's unpredictable nature. The liner notes also include musician and production credits. One should also note that there is strong language used on many of the tracks of this collection. Overall, this is a very good album - and a nice change of pace from the sounds that have penetrated late 1990s, early 2000s music. It's too bad that the New Radicals did not stay together because this could have been the first of a lot to come. Highly recommended 
I recently rediscovered this album, while rummaging through my vast record collection. When I was a young-mid adolescent, I really enjoyed the album. Now I not only enjoy the catchy pop-music, but I especially like the lyrical content. Gregg Alexander's subject matter ranges from romance, sex, tripping, addiction, radicalism, faith, etc. I especially like the narratives, "I hope I didn't...," and "Jehovah made..." The title track is very moody, but it does stand out as the most psychedelic/experimental track, and I it sounds great. Like many others I lamented Gregg Alexander's descision to end the project, which lead to the "One Hit Wonder" status. That title isn't too bad though since "You Get What you Give," is my favorite song on the album, which makes the New Radicals my favorite "One Hit Wonder." I'm not a huge fan of "pop" music, but this album has been one of the highlights of my music collection for quite some time now. 
I bought this cd when it first came out and loved it immediately (still do). I was listening to the new Broken Social Scene this morning and was reminded of this cd. I decided to look through amazon.coms listings to see if there was another cd by Greg Alexander and was very surprised at all the negative reviews. I read an interview in which Joni Mitchell gave praise to this cd, and that toppled with how much I like it put me in shock as to how many people have expressed negativity toward this piece of work. If this guy is just posing with this cd then I've been brainwashed too. 
My musical journey hasn't even reached a 2 digit number of years yet, but it's been quite profound so far. I count my album collection by the hundreds. I really truly love all the albums I own, but I've been blown away by an album only so little times. (Nevermind, Dark side of the Moon, Blue, Moon Safari). Now - when I say blown away - I mean it. Literaly. Blown away, to me, means having to sit back and re-think everything you thought you knew about music and discovering a whole new genre, a new approach. Discovering you like something else. That's blown away, as far as I'm concerned. And this album definately blew the hell out of me. I remember hearing it for the first time, on some early morning train ride, that went through the sun, through the rain, and back to sun light again. From that first string pluck to that very last "truly obnoxious instrument" monolog, I was simply amazed. I never thought I'd like country music, or anything related to it, for that matter. And the whole atmosphere of the album - so relaxed, so free, so "we're here just for the fun of it. really" kind of feeling. I've only heard that feeling come out of one other album - "Traveling Wilburys Volume 1". The only thing David and Jerry wanted to get/achieve in these recordings was the shere pleasue of hearing each other play together, and the excitement of what the music may do while they play. If you're a dead head, you'll probably get this album anyway. If you're not, if you only have a couple (or less) "dead" albums, then pick this one up. You're exactly where I was when i pressed that "play" button 
Different styles of bluegrass,and old tunes make this a very interesting musical find!!! Once you hear the title track you will find it hard to keep the song out of your head,I cant quit ,singing ,humming and whistling it 
My ears first delighted to this jewel of an album on a driftboat trip through the Rogue River valley, and it's been one of my favorites ever since. Highly recommended to anyone with an appreciation for great music 
Though I did my share of listening to the Grateful Dead in college (1970s), I was not, at the time, that much of a Dead-Head. I may be slow, but I'm gettin' there now (or maybe I should say I'm a Garcia/Grismanhead). I came across this terrific album about a year ago, and it has become one of my all-time faves. Jerry Garcia and David Grisman (who plays a mighty mean mandolin) collaborated on a number of acoustic albums together, and this one, a collection of acoustic old time folk and traditional songs, is one of the best. The music is pure and sweet and often sad. Garcia's voice is somehow so strangely magnetic and alluring, and their unadorned instrumental accompaniments are so simple and yet lovely. As you listen to these songs, you feel as if you could be sitting and listening to these two guys in a pub in 19th century London or Boston. The other album these guys did that is not to be missed is The Pizza Tapes. 
Great music to listen to also learn to play with. If you want to get away from mainstream rock, pop, or country listen to hard to come by music classic traditional then this is it 
I fell in love with this album the second I heard it. This album captures the essence of two friends just sitting around and playing old time tunes. This album also affirmed by admiration for jerry garcia showing his true talent outside of the grateful dead 
This CD is an absolute essential for anyone who loves old timey music, acoustic music, Mississippi John Hurt's smooth Delta blues, Jerry Garcia/David Grisman together or alone, or English folk and sailing songs. Yeah, the CD is THAT eclectic. The CD kicks off with the old English classic, Shady Grove, which was made popular back in the late '60s when Quicksilver Messenger Service included a rocked-out version (with great Nicky Hopkins piano) on an album titled, Shady Grove. Then we slip off into so Stealin', Louis Collins, Casey Jones (not the Dead's version), Dreadful Wind and Rain and, from a '60s album of sea chanteys, the wonderful tale of The Handsome Cabin Boy. The CD closes with the American classic Down in the Valley. (Well, there's a bonus track after that, but you'll have to buy the CD to find out what it is.) I've owned this CD since it was released in 1996 and it has never gotten old. (A companion to this, in a way, is the equally enjoyable Pizza Tapes CD by Garcia/Grisman.) This CD captures Jerry in a relaxed atmosphere, away from the pressure of being JERRY GARCIA OF THE GRATEFUL DEAD, and his gentle humor and comments reveal the soft side of the Jerry many of us loved so dearly. Grisman balances Garcia wonderfully (the songs were recorded in Grisman's home studio), and there is a gentle friendship and love of music that the two share that comes across so sweetly on this album. For me, it's the best Jerry Garcia solo album. It shows a rare side of Garcia, and at 64 minutes, it's a nice hour of acoustic music with the listener having the honor of sitting in with two old friends. Highly, highly recommended 
As I work my way through various Grisman Garcia collabarations I continue to be astounded elated. I am particularly taken w/this disc. It is as much a celebration of their musical powress as their friendship. This disc is the first of several volumes arranged by Grisman according to genre. These are traditional folk songs ballads. Grisman is releasing them to showcase Garcia's musical depth breadth. The same could be said of Grisman's artistry.Many of the songs here I heard for the first time but definitely not the last. The accompaning booklet is lovingly crafted. The history of each song is presented as are the lyrics. Grisman's Garcia's friendship allow us to connect to a simpler purer time that is very much a part of our legacy. As always the Acoustic Disc quality has to be heard to be fully appreciated 
Shady Grove brings a fresh new sound back form the turn of the 19th century. Tales of whaling ships, romance, and beauty encompass this Garcia/Grishman recording. A beautiful rendition of John Hurt's Louis Collins highlights this disk full of colorful tales and innovative musicianship. Even if you are not a fan of folk/bluegrass music you will fall in love with this CD for its sure brilliance and heartfelt emotion 
a brilliant album by what may be the most talented band around right now. karate is a stellar band who never fails to deliver. if you like any of their old stuff, give this a try. i've been a huge fan since their 2nd album and they never cease to impress me. this album is a mix of a lot of the sounds you've heard before. the jazz, the beauty and some of the pep of old albums, it's all there. mixed with the amazing musicianship of these three. if you like karate, pick this up. if you dont or you haven't heard them, you owe it to yourself to try 
I have no idea why Karate remains so under the radar. They are by far one of the most talented and unique-sounding bands in existence. I have loved everything I've heard by them. This album especially delights me, as it features a lot of really tasty jazzy guitar riffing. The bass playing is also extremely nice and melodic and adventurous. If you like rock music that deftly blends in the influence of jazz and prog without ever getting bombastic, slick or soul-less, then give Karate a listen 
Karate's most recent album, it is anything but contrived. Soulful lyrics, and good guitar riffs, etc. Songs 1-6 are great and worth twice as much as you'll pay. Clean album..."Water" is the jam. Buy it 
Well, yes, I was one of those kids who took tap dancing and ballroom dancing lessons mostly due to Fred and Ginger movies along with keeping my twin brother and I out of mischief. But now to this extraordinary double CD set! First, there is a lot of charming music in this collection which has excellent sound quality. The songs include not just the singing parts but also the dancing parts. So, you can visualize the duo dancing while your eyes are closed just listening. Plenty of excellent music is included. All of the big hits. There is also a nice booklet included with plenty of info about the songs, movies and Fred and Ginger. There are also plentiful "Behind the scenes" pictures. So OK, the song "The Piccolino" is not included in this set. It's just that Rhino Records could not buy the rights to the song for a "Fair" price (in Rhino's opinion). But, since the overall double CD set is just so wonderfully put together, you don't even really notice it, folks. This is a real treasure of song, dance and memories taking you back to a time when the only things that seemed "dirty" were your knees as you were trying to dance like Fred Astaire. OVERALL RATING: A 
After years of success on the Broadway stage, Fred Ginger started off their movie careers in 1933 with the frothy comedy, "Flying Down To Rio," and went on to make ten films for the RKO studio, each of which, naturally, included plenty of high-class hoofing and Tim Pan Alley songsmithing. This generous 2-CD set gathers nearly all the musical numbers from these films -- "Top Hat," "Gay Divorcee" and others -- along with some incidental dialogue and even extended passages with the ratatatat-tarrrump!! of Astaire's tapdancing. It's classic material, with lively versions of some of the biggest standards of the 'Thirties (Astaire's films were often used as vehicles to introduce pop hits to a mass audience...) There's also a roughness and informality to these recordings that many folks might find appealing, as the music is lifted straight from the actual films, and that's part of the charm... Okay, so maybe we have to admit that Ginger Rogers was a terrible singer, but Astaire's gentle crooning more than makes up for it, and all of these old tracks are tremendously entertaining, as well as historically rich. Recommended 
I was thrilled to discover this CD set. Previously, I had been looking for Fred Astaire albums that included the songs from his films with Ginger Rogers, but they were all slightly different from their film versions (some people may not have noticed, but it really bothered me). Then, I found this at my local library and loved it so much I had to buy my own copy. These are, obviously, the songs exactly as they are heard in the films, as they are all taken directly from the film source. I know that some have put down the audio quality as "poor". Granted, the quality is not up to par with the audio on recordings currently being produced. However, it's important to remember these recordings are from the 1930s. It's only natural that they won't have the same kind of audio quality and crispness we're used to now. With that in mind, I was satisfied with the recordings. One of the great things about this set is the dialogue from the movies that is included with some of the songs. I was pleasantly surprised by it and, as someone else mentioned, it really does conjure up the movie scenes again in your mind. I also think it should be mentioned that the "liner notes" included here are much more than a simple song list. It is a 39 page booklet with pictures, a history of both Astaire and Rogers lives and careers (including a history of their real-life romance), as well as information on the movies and their creation. For a fan, having this booklet included is a wonderful, added bonus. I rated this CD package 4 stars because 4 1/2 wasn't available. The reason I demoted it that 1/2 a star is because there are a few songs from the films that were not included, namely "The Piccolino" from TOP HAT, the reprise of "A Fine Romance/The Way You Look Tonight" from the finale of SWING TIME, and "Since They Turned Loch Lomand Into Swing" from CAREFREE. Still, because of what is included, I think this is well worth purchasing for any Astaire/Rogers fans. [I also recommend the 2-disk CD set "Fred Astaire at MGM", if you'd like to own the songs from "THE BARKELYS OF BROADWAY", his final film with Ginger Rogers. 
If you like your IHOP all syrup and no pancakes, "You See Colours" is probably the record that plays over your diabetic coma. If you can stomach it, this is unabashed pop music basking in its own sweet-toothed, kitschy luster. The new Delays album doesn't so much fire off songs; rather, battering rams of melody and harmony. It's a disc that conceivably could be enjoyed equally by mainstream pop listeners (more accustomed to electronic tinsel and ornament in their music) as well as more demanding fans of well-crafted indie pop. Bubblegum swallowers are going to fatten up quick with "You See Colours"; more than anything, the music suggests that the main thing to remember is to have a good time listening. Principle songwriter and vocalist Greg Gilbert makes that easy-- he can hit high notes with a tonal purity that would make Bellamy or Buckley blush, but holds enough in reserve for crunchy vocal caterwauling should the situation call for such. "You See Colours" begins with an a capella figure breaking into a synth-string-aided toe-tapper ("You Me"), immediately followed by the "My Sharona"-ish "can't help but dance to it" groove of "Valentine." "This Town's Religion" plays like a bizarre lovechild of REM and Joy Division, and tunes like "Lillian" are surefire subconscious classics, full of riffs and "oooh-whooo" melodies that stick to even the most non-stick cynical of minds. Sure, a few bland by-the-numbers numbers ("Winter's Memory of Summer") can bring down any record. But back them up with the pistoning "Out of Nowhere," with its eight mile high keyboard, swaggering backbeat and well-placed, muted guitar, and hardly anyone will notice. By the time "Waste of Space" starts to spin some drama with confident, simple guitar chords (supported by a twist of La's in the cracking vocals), it's easy to call this record "brilliant," even if that just means shiny with sun-soaked melodies. It's superb Beatles pop wired on caffeine, bouncing off the walls of a studio filled with electronic keyboards. And as might be expected, that is so, so sweet 
The first time I heard anything by The Delays, I thought it was something by Blondie. Delays are a UK quartet, and this CD (their second) has a catchy sunny synth rock sound with tight harmonies, and lead vocalist Greg Gilbert's falsetto (think Savage Garden) towering over with ease. Sugary sweet with an edge. It's tough for me to pick standouts from an album this good. Everything is so melodic; `Too much in your life', `You and me' (with great cutting violins), the swirling synths of `Valentine' (with great scratchy guitars set to a dance beat), `Given time', are all beautiful upbeat songs, with the lone ballad being the closing track `Waste of space', which sounds dreamy and atmospheric. Like the title says, very colorful pop music! 
the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good 
...then its likely that you already know about this group. In fact, you've probably already nabbed this album and are looking for evidence that someone likes it as much as you do. I'm one of those people. In fact, I think I like it better (as a whole) than Faded Seaside Glamour. This is technically The Delays second full-length album, however they've recorded at least as many songs for B-sides to their singles (all of which are worthy of tracking down, I might add). Of these, Ride It On, Whenever You Fall I Die Lost In A Melody are must-haves. Delays records definitely have that Phil Spector-ish "wall of sound" texture--big, layered melodies that would sound lush coming from transistor AM radios. The effect is a perfect compliment to Greg Gilbert's powerful falsetto. The lyrics can be downright indecipherable at times, but you won't care cuz the melodies are so addictive. Check out the archived live performance by the Delays from 7/28/2004 on KCRW.org 
I love these guys. I saw their first ever gig in the US and drank with them. Their first albumn was very good and this one will have you hooked. The 11 songs are very good and well produced. If you liked their first cd, get this one as well. Its not Punk music, thank god, but more like their single Lost In A Melody that came out after their first cd. 
I absolutely adore this album! Relative to CL's other albums, it has more eloquent lyrics than "Meander," but rocks just as hard in a more intelligent way, has stand-out songs as opposed to "Ether-Inspired Porch Music" (where the songs blend together pleasantly), is far less Celtic than "Echo Echo," and not mellow at all like "Indian Summer." The chord progressions are phenomenal -- especially in "Summer Song" and "November/Make Believe"-- the songs will go places you won't expect and it's just amazing. I've listened to this CD hundreds of times, and the musicianship never fails to astound me. The acoustic guitar-work is to die for! Barry's voice ranges from husky to uber-clear, from smooth as silk to a rockin' scream. If you've never fallen in love with that velvet-voiced cutie Barry Privett, you need to do it now. Of all the albums, this one showcases his diverse vocal talents the best. This is one of my favorite albums ever. It's perfect for driving -- it seemed like it was meant to be listened on a bright morning drive through the Appalachians, when you're flying at 75 mph amongst the conifers. It just makes you happy; I don't think it is possible to listen to "Shadows" and not feel uplifted. Fans of "Indian Summer" and "Ether" might be a little shocked by this at first, but give it a few runs in your CD player before dismissing it as a an album not by the Carbon Leaf you know and love. It is first and foremost a rock album; CL has mellowed considerable since this was made in the late 90s. See these boys live if you ever have the chance. I saw them open for Guster -- and it was Carbon Leaf that got the standing ovation, not Guster. CL should have been headlining, judging from the enthusiastic crowd reaction. They love what they do So much; their enthusiasm and love for the music is contagious.  (For reference, I listen to Andrew Bird; Jump, Little Children; Guster; The Dole; Flogging Molly; and the Folk station on Yahoo.) Buy this album immediately, and then head over to [...] to sample many tracks off the others, find out when you can catch CL live, and admire photos of these talented and gorgeous musicians. p.s. They are sweet in person too. : 
Before Carbon Leaf got "ether-electrified", before Carter Gravatt began rocking on a mandolin, before Barry Privett was dancing jigs with his pennywhistle, and Jordan Medas signed on and brought his strong bass chops to the group, Carbon Leaf released Shadows In The Banquet Hall. Shadows is more of a rock album, although the distinctive acoustic guitar pluck we have come to know from Carter on subsequent albums is present. That more bluegrass-tinged acoustic guitar is apparent on several songs, including Wolftrap and Fireflies, Attica's Flower Box Window and Reunion Monticello. On the rock side of the spectrum we find songs like Blind Session Eye, with its cleverly arranged guitar licks, driving beat and hard rockin' jam at the end. The overall flow of the album is mellow and thoughtful, due in large part to Barry's intelligent, abstract, somewhat esoteric lyrics. This is not to imply that they are inaccessable though. The songs simply require a careful listener, one who is willing to let their mind travel along with the music, through the stories and emotions being expressed. An example of this is Summer Song, which is able to convey a beautiful portrait of summers come and gone through brief lyrical phrases that impart different images in the listener's mind, but still leave them free to weave those images into their own memories and experiences. Barry has an ability to create lyrics that the listener can so openly relate to and apply to his or her own life. This great talent comes into full bloom on future albums, but is doubtless evident on Shadows too. Immediate standout songs including Flood, with its heavy bass line from then-bassist Devin McGuire and "low rock" rhythms (no doubt influenced by the band Morphine), the beautiful acoustic guitar and soft vocals on November(makebelieve), and For The Girl, with its intensely moving music and powerful vocals (and hints at the Celtic-influenced music to come later) showcase the wide range of Carbon Leaf's musicality. Throughout we can hear the beginnings of the "ether-electrified", Celtic- and bluegrass-tinged rock sound that Carbon Leaf has created on later albums. Whether a fan of Carbon Leaf or a new listener, Shadows In The Banquet Hall has something to offer through strong acoustic and electric guitarwork and thought-provoking, intelligent lyrics; it is most certainly an album worth listening to. 
This recording is less accessible than their later Echo Echo, but it rewards the patient listener. Carbon Leaf's gift is the ability to create gorgeous soundscapes that perfectly reflect the lyrics of each song. That gift is in full flower here, and the result is an album that coheres as a whole. Expect to need a few listens before it worms its way into your head, but once it does, you'll never forget it 
I was informed of Carbon Leaf a month ago and I can not get enough of them. Great sound for a small band from Va 
Jack Johnson is one of the best song writers out in the world of music where catchy phrases and lack of musical variety rule the world of music its good to hear something that tells a story and leaves something with the listener. With his great guitar Jack Johnson has no paricular genre but great music. Although his songs start to get bland after listening to them a while Jack Johnson changes up things with songs like Belle,Good People,and Sitting,Waiting,Wishing. This is probably one of the best albums I've bought in years, and with its great melodies and great lyrics it'll have you reciting the words at your desk at work in no time. 
This CD is the best I've heard from Jack Johnson. Even though Jack's talent on guitar and vocals is clear in everything he does, this CD offers a variety of tunes unmatched by anything else he has done. Definitely his #1 offerin 
Jack Johnson is a Hawaiian surfer turned singer. Much like his favourite sport, his music is simple, sensitive and summery. `In between dreams' comprises stripped down songs largely driven by his guitar, some bass, and percussion, with emphasis on his soothing vocals; a welcome change from most of the over-produced chart fare. I'm glad to see this CD hit #2 in the US. What we get is a collection of lovely acoustic, almost folk songs like the opening cut `Never know', the hit `Good people', the very catchy `Sitting, waiting, wishing', the rather funky `Staple it together' (lovely scratchy guitar work and rapid fire vocal delivery - excellent!), `Breakdown', and '`Crying shame'. `If I could' has poignant lyrics about life, and the brief `Belle' is a jazzy interlude with horns and guitar, and lyrics in French and English, picture a romantic walk down the Seine at night. `Situations' is another lovely all too brief guitar piece. I can't get enough of it. Jack Johnson is a great songwriter/guitarist, and I shall be getting all his CDs. 
Do any other bro's love Jack Johnson as much as I do? Sometimes I chill with my bros and we listen to it together. It gets you so pumped. Sometimes I go chill with other bros and bring my gamecube and Jack Johnson album with me 
This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer. His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South. He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's 
I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album 
Item is exactly what i wanted. It came in quick time and was perfect. Thanks 
Guitarist Jack Johnson returns better than ever with IN BETWEEN DREAMS. With an interesting style of mainly accoustic Pop/Folk songs, Johnson gives an outstanding performance on this album. There is a piece that is a good blues accompianied by an electric guitar as well, and this gives the album a great contour. "Belle" is a perfect performance of a Bossa Nova, and this has an amazing impact to IN BETWEEN DREAM's overall sound. This record also has great instrumentation of the percussion section. This gives Johnson's sound totally different feel compared to his common accoustic performance. Like always, his lyrics are mainly in story form. They just add even more flare of originality to Johnson's record. The great thing about this album is that Johnson knows how to perform his genre to its full extent. He's got great guitar lines and that's what makes him such an amazing artist. With pieces having recognizable melody lines help in declaring Johnson as an amazing artist as well. IN BETWEEN DREAMS is definately an album any music fan should hear. Stand out tracks include: "Never Know" "Banana Pancakes" "Sitting, Waiting, Wishing" "Staple It Together" "If I Could" "Breakdown" 
I found this music a little slow at times, but it has thoughtful lyrics and would make good background music or just for relaxation 
Saw the broadway cast a couple days before opening and thought it was a sweet, warm hearted musical that would have played better off-broadway in a smaller venue. Have seen it several times since on smaller stages and was right. Much better as an intimate show than on a large broadway stage. Still, has a delightfully charming score, hits the nail on the head about fears of childbirth. Liz Callaway is wonderful. She should have become bigger on the NY stage. Very enjoyable CD 
This is one of the best musicals, in my opinion. The only thing better is to see a live performance of the show. Incredible voices sing fabulous music. It is so exciting to listen to 
I wasn't familiar with this musical, until I saw a local production of the show few years ago. It quickly became one of my favorite musicals. The songs were very catchy and most of the songs have perceptive and touching lyrics that deal primarily with relationships. The story is about three couples who have to deal with the prospect of having a baby. One is a college couple (Lizzie and Danny) who just move in together. The other one is a middle-aged couple (Alan and Arlene) who were looking forward to a life without the kids after sending their youngest kid to college. And the last one is a couple (Nick and Pam) having a hard time conceiving. The opening song "We Start Today" brilliantly set upped the premise of the show. All the situations of the three couples were introduced in that song. "What Could Be Better" is cute and fun song that has an upbeat melody and playful lyrics. Liz and Danny enthusiastically imagine how that "tiny mix up" would be their baby or as they call it a "genetic duet" and a "two part invention". I was surprised that the three "Romance" numbers by Pam and Nick weren't quite as enjoyable in the recording compared to hearing the songs sung in the show. Another witty song is "I Want It All" where all the three women sang their hearts out about how they want everything. Pam was hysterical with her obsession with motherhood as well as Arlene, the veteran among the three, anticipating the hard work of taking care of a baby. "I Chose Right" is one of the most romantic heartfelt love songs I've heard. Danny sang this to Lizzie before leaving for his band tour. It was a simple song yet it speaks volume about how Danny feels for Lizzie. Act 1 ended by the powerful "The Story Goes On". This song happened after Lizzie felt her child's first kick. The maternal feelings that eluded her in the first few weeks of her pregnancy finally sink into her consciousness. "The Ladies Singing Their Song" opened the second act. This is about Liz's observation of how people even those she doesn't know seem to be obsessed with her belly. Other highlights include "Two People in Love" which was sung by Danny and Lizzie in their first meeting after Danny left for the band tour. This is probably the fluffiest song in the album. The lyrics didn't do justice to the very upbeat and catchy music. But this is such a fun song you won't mind the trite lyrics. "With You" is the duet of Nick and Pam reassuring themselves that a baby doesn't define their relationship. The important thing is that they love each other, with or without a baby in their future. "Easier to Love", Alan's solo, is about how a parent-child love is so much easier because your kid always sees you in your best light. But a love shared between two lovers is much tougher because you see each other eye to eye. You see the person, warts and all. "And What If We Had Loved Like That" is sung by Arlene and Alan reminiscing how their relationship worked out the way they planned yet something still went wrong with their relationship. Then all three couples were joined together for a triumphant finale with their newfound and much healthier perspective with their lives, their relationships, and of course about BABIES. Grade: 
Baby is an underappreciated musical theater gem from the 83-84 season. The songs by Maltby/Shire are tuneful and fun, and the orchestrations bright. Numbers such as What Could Be Better?, I Chose Right, The Story Goes On, The Ladies Singing Their Song, and Two People In Love are some of the best American musical songs of the 80s. This CD is also a must due to it being the first major role for Liz Callaway, one of today's best singers and actors in theater. She shines and Liz and Todd Graff obtained Tony Award nominations for this show. Highly recommended 
A great show makes a great CD. I will never understand why this show didn't become a hit! I saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since. Maltby and Shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful B'way show. This score is great- Fatherhood Blues, I Want It All, The Story Goes On, The Ladies Singing Their Song- These are unforgetable and deserved to be heard. Get this gem 
The area where this film takes place is in Basilicata, a poor southern region of Italy but rich with family ties and culture. The director is a genius at filming the family and their friends, capturing the immense poverty of the land and yet showing its richness. Ezio Bosso's movie is extradorinary. There are several themes to come away with, but what stays is the visual impression of Basilicata's intense and unspoiled beauty 
The show isnt a flop, just not a hit. The Music and rhymes seem a bit forced. I'm sorry but, Andrews does not impress me in this role. The music isnt bad, but the lyrics are unavoidable. For collectors (like myslef) and Andres fans this is a good one to get, for those looking for some catchy show tunes, this is not quite it. If I had to pick a best song on the album it would be "Living in the Shadows 
I have been a fan of Julie Andrews before ever seeing her on screen.As a child i was given a Lp record before Mary Poppins and was delighted with her singing .I have loved the movies i have seen and recently saw Victor/Victoria 1982 and loved it.To my delight I casually asked at the Warehouse if they had the dvd, not thinking they would, was able to purchase the broadway show .My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed both performances and was delighted to see Julie performing on stage.Both shows were wonderful and people shouldn't forget the age differences of Julie 47 and 60 in these shows and how she was working as hard at 60 as she did at 21, by performing 8 shows a week.I say a fantastic job done on both and bravo to Julie and Blake on their wonderful acheivements. The music in both is lovely 
Jodi benson appears in one of very few, but marveolus broadway performances!The music on this recording even downplays bensons work in disneys " The Little Mermaid"! It is and energetic fun-filled musical, yet it is based solely upon the one emotion that is so ellusive, yet so desired,love. Benson's rendition of someone to watch over me is absolutely amazing!overall this CD is well worth the money you put forth on it. I would also suggest the music book too for musicians as myself---Robert Ellis,1 
The original cast of Crazy For You is superb. The songs are of course amazing. What Gershwin song isn't? Jodi Benson will blow you away with her beyond amazing voice and talent. Highlights include "Someone to Whatch Over Me", "Could You Use Me", "But Not For Me", "I Got Rhythm", "Embraceable You", and "They Can't Take That Away From Me". Every song on this CD is practically perfect. You won't go wrong if you purchase Crazy For You 
I have to say up front that I have never seen the theatrical production of Crazy for You. My daughter recently returned from a thespian festival in Nebraska where she saw the musical performed by a wonderful troupe from New Albany High School in Indiana. She enjoyed it so much that she wanted to purchase the soundtrack and it wasn't long before I had confiscated this CD for myself.  The musical is billed as a new Gershwin comedy and the songs, many of which are familiar tunes made over, are simply fabulous. The CD booklet states that the production, which opened on Broadway in 1992, was given carte blanche by the Gerswin estate and the result is marvelous! A few of my favorites are Someone to Watch Over Me (exquisitely sung by Jodi Benson of Disney's Little Mermaid fame), What Causes That a lost song rediscovered in 1982 and one of the most delightful tunes on the entire album, and Slap that Bass a toe-tapping number that will have you on your feet and looking for a pair of tap shoes. :)Other familiar numbers are I've Got Rhythm, Embraceable You and Nice Work if You Can Get It.  Do you need a little something to brighten your mood? Well buy this CD!! You'll feel happier in no time! : 
I bought this CD to practice for my school play and was really helpful. It also has good songs to listen to 
I decided to check this out after my kids performed in "Crazy For You" at our high school. It was such a wonderful performance I thought I'd try the orig. recording. Ok, it doesn't have the sentimental value that the high school performance did, but it's a great CD for Broadway buffs 
Crazy For You is a charming musical with awesome visuals. When I saw it performed live, I was amazed at the dancing, along with the singing and other stuff. But what makes this musical outstanding is the large amount of rigorous (I don't know if that's the word I'm looking for but) dancing. I bet the stars of the show were so hot/tired by the end of it due to the dancing but they did terrific. Some of the dances were so complex, such as the one where they piled high a triangle of chairs on stage (so you know they were'nt glued down or anything) and almost the entire cast balances on them and then leave the two main characters standing alone at the very top was just "Wow." Anyway, I can't dance at all so I was very impressed. That's why I'm only giving four stars (I didn't have the heart to give it three) to this five star musical because without the stupendous dancing/visuals, the songs are not as powerful 
This album is absolutely nothing like Science, nothing like morning view, nothing like make yourself, and nothing like clotm. Ya know what, the same could be said of any of those albums. Every Incubus album is something completely differet. Hard and fast on Make Yourself, Melodic on morning view, kinda screwy and melodic on science and very deep and melodic for clotm. You get something new everytime, if you really enjoy incubus youll find something to enjoy in all their albums. Sure, Fungus doesnt have the technical musical talent or vocal talent, but its intense and fun. Exactly what those guys wanted when they were 17, all about weed and shrooms and having fun. If thats the mood your in pickup fungus. If your in the mood for something more meaningful grab something after science. Anyways, Incubus always has something to offer, theres no reason to argue over which album is better 
Incubus has always created interesting music even way back in the days of "Fungus Amongus". Sound wise, it's slightly different than the Incubus we know and love today. This is way back when they were just young kids trying to emulate their favorite bands. It would be a few more years until Incubus started to invent their own sound. The album does manage to satisfy most Incubus fans. My favorite tracks on this album would probably have to be "You Will Be A Hot Dancer", "Trouble In 421", "Sink Beneath The Line", and of course "Hilikus". Here are my track ratings for the album... 1. You Will Be A Hot Dancer - 9.5/10 2. Shaft - 6/10 3. Trouble In 421 - 9/10 4. Take Me To Your Leader - 8.5/10 5. Medium - 9/10 6. Speak Free - 9/10 7. The Answer - 8/10 8. Psychopsilocybin - 8/10 9. Sink Beneath The Line - 9.5/10 10. Hilikus - 10/10 Overall: 86% B When I heard this album for the first time I didn't really think it was that great. Over time I have actually grown to enjoy it although. No, maybe this record isn't the greatest thing the band has ever put out but it still has some pretty good tracks. It does also kind of give you an idea of where the band began. If you are a big fan of Incubus you should probably check this out, I'm sure you'll find something you like. If you're not a big fan then this one is probably not for you 
first, a disclaimer: i am not a big fan of anything that incubus released after enjoy. SCIENCE and MAKE YOURSELF are good albums, but not great like FUNGUS is. i am not a fan of modern mainstream rock, and thats all that this band had become by 1998. however, FUNGUS AMONGUS (along with the similar ENJOY! EP) is probably my favorite album of the 1990's. the sound the band had here is much different than that of their later recordings, and reviewers are not too far off by saying it is akin to PRIMUS, RHCP, and MR. BUNGLE all rolled into one (which is a direct quote from the liner notes of the disc, may I add). but there's more to it than that. its funky, heavy, and it flows along very well. mike's guitar leads are nothing to write home about in terms of technical aspects, but his tone and execution are incredible. dirk's slap bass reigns supreme as well. i'd compare this more to JAM BAND music than the "modern rock" incubus have become associated with these days. the feelgood, energetic vibe of the guitar lines, the tones of the instruments, the psychedelic feel of the whole thing, and the overall funkiness. sort of like, headseed-era MOE. mixed with a bit of PRIMUS for extra heaviness. but unlike most jam bands (MOST), INCUBUS aren't at all boring. the vibe is intense. these days, they are praised for their good looks and brandon boyd's pretentious, whiny, "introspective and deep" songwriting. and thats all they have anymore. but in 1996, they were just 4 stoned teenagers jamming out on some feel-good muzak about eating shrooms and girls with ants in their pink tacos (she shoulda worn underpants!). they carried this sound sooo well, they never should have gotten so serious about things because the loose, jammy vibe of this album is exactly what they are suited for. its just fun, trippy music that doesnt necessarily mean anything at all. its not going to make you think, and is best listened to after a hearty meal of psilocybin containing fungal growths. and its most definitely not a pretentious piece of modern art rock trash that teenage girls cry over, and scenesters find to be "deep" and "meaningful". this is the real incubus, folks, before they tried to prove something unidentifiable to the world 
Please bare with me over the course of this review. Every single note, lyric, effect and dynamic change on this CD was and is amazing. You can tell Incubus wrote this album to assist their shroom trips and created together back when the music aspect was most important. In the same light, my friends and I have a band and writing music as friends is more important than making music people would like to us. The friendship aspect is what makes this album so genuine. Besides that, the CD was too advanced to believe. The guitars were blazing and innovative, the bass-lines were GENIUS, the drumming was insanely demanding and the vocals fit perfect in every song. Just listen to the random sounds they have going on throughout the tracks! Literally sit there and ask yourself "what made them think to add THAT?!" Now to experience the multitude of how great this album is is to go beyond the boundaries of their modern, poppier sound. I love everything Incubus has done but you've just got be open to other things and enjoy it! Oh yeah... trippin on shrooms or smokin hemp would also assist the Fungus Amongus experience 
If you have ever read the insert to this album, the band admits that they were trying be the red hot chilli peppers, primus, and mr. bungle all rolled into one, but considering that they were still teenagers when recording all of the songs on this album you have to cut them some slack. Fungus Amongus showed the potential that these guys had. Today they have thrown away most of the talent they once had in order to make it big. Even though make yourself was a solid release, it showed signs that the band was selling out. Their two latest releases were pretty lackluster. Its just too bad theyll never make an album of this quality again. So heres how Id rank all of lncubus' albums from best to worst 1. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. 2. Fungus Amongus 3. Make Yourself 4. A Crow Left of the Murder 5. Morning Vie 
What's with all the negaitve reviews!? This is my favorite Incubus album for one simple reason: Every song on here has a groove. It was this album that made me want to pick up the guitar. I have now played for about 3 years and still going strong. Well, enough about me. This album features some funky guitar, very good drums, and some VERY bizzare vocals. Every track on this CD deserves a rating. 1. You'll Be a Hot Dancer - 10/10. Great opener with some really grooving verse. The guitar solo is really well-played. 2. Shaft - 7/10. This is easily the worst song on the album. Just to weird and doesn't fit the groove of the record. 3. Trouble In 421 - 10/10. This is a Really good song. This song has several guitar solos, and overall is a pretty good jam song. 4. Take Me to Your Leader - 9/10. Very good song, sounds like it could be on S.C.I.E.N.C.E. 5. Medium - 9/10. This song features a funny intro and a pretty sweet bassline. 6. Speak Free - 10/10. I have never heard such kickass slap bass! This is one of the heavier songs, but one of the best. This is my 2nd favorite song. 7. The Answer - 9/10 . Great Riff and a pretty good song. 8. Phsychosylocybin - 10/10 Excellent jam song! This is one of the funkiest tunes on the album, and has some excellent solos in it on drums, guitar, and bass! 9. Sink Beneath The Line - 10/10. This song is by far my favorite song on the album. Maybe even ever. This song's got some really fancy guitar work as long as some De La Rocha-style rapping in the bridge. This song is worth the price of the album. 10. Hilikus - 10/10. Great closer. A simpler, poppier song with some excellent bass. This is my 3rd favorite song on the album. With all that said, buy this album if you're a fan of Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Maroon 5, Korn, and, of course, Incubus. Enjoy Incubus 
i enjoy incubus they are a talented group but from hearing this it sounds like its written before they learned how to play there instruments properly.its way too intense even most metal heads would probably be a bit intimidated.fungus amoungus is an example of when something becomes so heavy its unlistenable.it sounds more like korn than incubus.in fact it reminds my of system of a downs debut (a much better album) just alot more intense and no real pause for melody ok theyve shown ability in creating something so intense and unlistenable but its just like people who want to go to see a guitarist who can play really fast for over an hour. i like incubus but all there other work is much better than this morning view make yourself science crow left of the murder this dosnt even compare to them i gave it to stars because the song shaft sounds like it could of been a filler of science and i like incubus but steer well clear 
I am a diehard Incubus fan and Fungus Amongus (Fungus Among Us) as the root of all incubus is a sneak preview of how genious Incubus is and how smart they were about life as teenagers. The lyrics in fungus Amongus define what they are all about right now. If your heart and soul goes out to this band and you have an open mind you will see the beauty in the music as well as the lyrics, i think when Incubus say that they are somewhat disappointed in this album, it goes to show that they have learned QUITE a bit since then and are being modest about this all out CREATIVELY BOLD album. People that bash on this one need to listen to it with a different set of ears. Thanks, ENJOY 
Paul McCartney said that The Beach Boys album, Pet Sounds, is the greatest pop album ever written. It was his inspiration for Sgt. Pepper. Enough said..... 
Any serious music lover realizes this is a crucial collection of material to have. Wilson is at his creative best in this album. Just as we can say Sgt Pepper is a creative watershed for the Beattles, this is true for the Beach Boys.. The harmonies are equisite. The music without the lyrics have patterns reminnisent of clssical composers 
This album is phenomenal. This is the Beach Boys' best album. I like everything the Beach Boys have done, and this is the best. I must say that I am much more into the Beach Boys than the Beatles. Some of my favorite tracks are "I Know There's An Answer," "Here Today," and "God Only Knows." I also love "Wouldn't It Be Nice," "You Still Believe In Me," "Pet Sounds," "That's Not Me," "Don't Talk," "I'm Waiting for the Day," "Caroline, No," "Sloop John B," "Let's Go Away for a While," and "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times." Wait, that's every track on the album. Paul McCartney said, "It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. I've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life ..." Elton John called it a landmark album. If you don't get this album, you're insane! It's not the surfin' tunes that you think the Beach Boys produce. Check it out. Actually, I think this album is UNDER-hyped. It wasn't appreciated at its release, and most people still think that the Beach Boys only write surfing music and that all of their songs are the same. The fact is, the beach boys only wrote surfing songs for about 5 years out of the 30 years that they released records. And for those who don't like the cover, I think it's pretty darn funny to see these guys at a petting zoo. I think it's one of the best covers I've ever seen 
This is a masterpiece. I won't get into the Sgt. Peppers or Rubber Soul vs. Pet Sounds. I let this classic stand on its own. Brian Wilson stretched his wings on this one and the band followed. It is, at times, a little uneven, but the music stands up. "Wouldn't it be Nice" and "God Only Knows" are the deserved hits, but don't push aside the other not-so-popular titles like "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times," "I Know There's an Answer" and probably the most underrated Beach Boys song of all time, "Caroline No." A truly introspective album. It's deserving of the classic label. Truly a fantastic album. The Beach Boys showed they could do more than just surf and drag 
I've often said that Pet Sounds may be the greatest album ever made but it's not the greatest Beach Boys album. And what do I mean with that? I have no idea but it sounds cool. I can't really say if Pet Sounds is a better album than Smiley Smile, Sunflower or Surf's Up. They're all masterpieces. I'm not sure if any song from Pet Sounds is in my Beach Boys Top 10 but they're all in Top 30. However I think Pet Sounds is the most beautiful Beach Boys album, at the moment I think it's the most beautiful album ever made besides Original Sin by Pandora's Box/Jim Steinman and Baby Alone in Babylone by Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg. It starts with a very happy song "Wouldn't It Be Nice" and ends with a quite dark song "Caroline No". And a lot of different emotions can be heard between those two songs. And "Sloop John B", originally a Caribbean folk song, is the greatest cover version ever recorded. Brian Wilson's arrangement makes it more like a Beach Boys original than a cover version 
Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. "God only knows" is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using it as a coaster. In a word, BORING 
Take away comparisons to the Beatles and you've got an album here that just says "I feel good about life!I'm not sure about everything but I feel good about it"It's very serious,deep and emotional music given by a man who was and I suppose still is very emotional.Brian Wilson was full of love and a positive vibe around this time and it shows through here.This would be,for all intents and purposes,his last great hoorah.And what a finish!The listener is taken to a mystical ethereal place where young "unsuredness" is expressed in the most lovingly imagined way through a musical genious.I feel like saying what another review said: "Listen,listen,listen.....to his heart..beat. 
Cheap Trick (1977.) Cheap Trick's first album. In the seventies, many arena-oriented pop-rock artists made it big. One of many was Cheap Trick, whose enormous success was mostly attributed to the mass sales of their Live At Budokan record (in the seventies, live albums were all the rage, and often times an artist's live album would become the band's most popular record.) Unfortunately, due to the success of their live album, Cheap Trick's other work, in particular the material that predated it, tends to go unnoticed by fans of the group. Rick Nielsen, Robin Zander, Bun E. Carlos, and Tom Petersson released their Jack Douglas produced debut album in 1977. How does the band's first record measure up? Cheap Trick's debut album blew me away. My expectations were a litle unclear - for the most part, all I had heard from the group were songs from the Budokan album, the big hits, and their contribution to the Top Gun soundtrack. I'm not exactly sure what it was I was expecting, but I am more than satisfied with what I heard. Jack Douglas's production goes toward a raw sound that tries to capture the band's unadulterated, live show energy, and this style of producing the record succeeds beautifully. The general style of music on the record is a sort of hard pop-rock - something not many artists can do! The band's rock stylings are certainly harder and faster than many of a pop artist of the day, but they aren't anywhere near being as heavy as most so-called hard rock and heavy metal bands of the day were. The band's style was the happy medium between two extremes. Despite this debut not being much of a commercial success, it really was a great record. The band explores a variety of themes here, which only adds to the record's overall entertainment value. Rick Nielsen is seriously one of the most underrated guitarists in classic rock. His playing shines through on every track on this album. In the end, it doesn't bother me that this album didn't do that great commercially at its time of release - all I care about is the music, and it rules. This album was remastered, and I must say, the Sony Legacy people know how to do remasters! The album features the restoration of the original vinyl tracklist, new liner notes, rare photos, and even some bonus cuts (mostly alternative versions of the tracks.) Other record companies that do remasters could really learn a thing or two from Sony. Cheap Trick's debut is one of the best, and one of the most underrated classic rock releases of the seventies. Sure, it's their Budokan album and their later studio efforts of the late seventies and early eighties that get most of the credit, but this one is every bit as good (possibly better) than the popular stuff. Don't pass it by if you're a classic rock fan 
Among the top 10 best debuts in rock history, Cheap Trick hit their zenith with this one. The follow ups, "In Color" and "Heaven Tonight" should have been nearly as good, but stiff, dull production kept them from reaching the rock stratosphere that CT's debut rocketed into with the help of producer Jack Douglas, who captured a young, raw and brilliant rock band making history. Fans have been waiting for an album this good for nearly 30 years, and there's probably not one of us that doesn't think they can do it. Viva Cheap Trick 
Pretty audacious, all things considered, and there is a lot to consider. For one thing, this was originally released in 1977 along with the Sex Pistols' NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS and The Bee Gees/Robert Stigwood's SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. Quite a year, eh? And it still holds up after all these years. Producer Jack Douglas fortunately opted for a raw, live sound that sounds loud no matter how much you turn it down. The songs are top notch and it's a shame that there is no lyric sheet because the lyrics are almost overly intelligent, ranging from the junk culture critique 'The Ballad Of TV Violence' to the exquisite in-lust ode 'Mandocello' to suicide in 'Oh, Candy'. (There seems to be a Beatles fixation as well; 'Taxman' and 'Any Time At All' come immediately to mind and there are others; spot your own.) The 'problem' is that so much of this is so tongue-in-cheek that it's easy to take none of it seriously. The bonus tracks are good but not essential, although the early version of 'I Want You To Want Me' is interesting if only because it shows that Letters To Cleo added exactly nothing to it in their remake, whereas Cheap Trick did. Songs I like: 'Taxman, Mr Thief' (an ode to Harrison's ode and, for my money, even better); 'Oh, Candy' (beautifully melodic and bittersweet and with a brief but awesome guitar solo); 'He's A Whore' (punkier than The Lurkers, heh heh); 'Mandocello' ('I could be you lover, let's pretend'); 'The Ballad Of TV Violence' (reputedly an anti-ode to Richard Speck). Songs I don't like: 'The Coward Of The County'; 'Big Rock Candy Mountain'; 'Hey, Jude'; and boy am I glad they aren't on this CD 
I've always rejected the term "fan" as it's derived from that creepy word fanatic so what do you call someone who's entire perception of music was changed by one band and one album and will never be the same, crazy? Then commit me. Cheap Trick's debute album flew in the face of everything that was wrong with rock music in the late seventies (and frequently still is), pompous, arrogant and overblown. In one fell swoop the boys from Rockford changed all the rules and like Sherman to the sea set about a scorched earth policy that would make the General proud. What can be said about Robin Zanders vocals on this disc, on The Ballad of TV Violence he's a caged banshee relentlessly tearing at our ear drums and making us beg for mercy and more, while on Mandocello he takes us to some dark melodic place and shows us how to feel his pain. Rick Nielsen's master strokes of song craft and bone jarring riffs gave all of us junior high geeks a reason to beleive that maybe, if we ate our vegetables and said our prayers, we could grow up to be a guitar hero just like Rick. Ah, Bun E., coolest cat behind a drum kit with the uncanny knack of impersonating the sound of a jack hammer on concrete, nuff said! And oh the sweet growning and moaning of Tom Petersson's twelve string bass, while the rest of the world was having trouble with only four strings, Tom single-handedly informed wanna be bass players everywhere that maybe it was time to put the damn thing away and get a real job. Cheap Trick is everything that was right about the Sex Pistols, E.L.O., Sweet and the Move and at the same time made it painfully clear what they lacked, it made us realize what we were missing with everything else we listened to. It's the greatest non-live, live performance ever captured on tape. The tunes are irreverent, mind numbing, singable, screamable and perfect from start to finish. Dare yourself not to sing along with He's A Whore or Oh, Candy and it will be just another resolution you can't keep. If NASA were to have a mind to shoot one CD into space as a representation of everything that is right and good about American music this would be the one, and who could resist a higher intelligence belting out Hot Love?! The truth is out there and it is Cheap Trick. For over twenty years Cheap Trick has reminded us that it's time to get over ourselves a little and with this, there very first album, they've shown us that throwing caution to wind can be a little scary sometimes but it's always one hell of a ride 
This is a great, Great, GREAT CD!!! The music can stack up against ANY album. It is the "Abbey Road" of Cheap Trick. It starts with the powerful "ELO Kiddies" and the alarm clock ringing at the beginning of the song lets you know that this is a band you should wake up and pay attention to. It then changes gears with Tom's bass into the sickly twisted "Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School." It then transitions smoothly with the sound of kids playing (shades of the Beatles) into "Taxman, Mr. Thief," where they directly tip their hats off to the Beatles by using the name Mr. Heath. "Cry Cry" changes up the pace with a slip-sliding slow chunker, then "Oh Candy" spotlights the band's ability to create hard hitting up beat rock songs. Another change up into the slamming steamroller "Hot Love." This song rips is like a sports car at full throttle. Robin's beautiful voice is show cased in the haunting ballad "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace." Another smooth transition with Bun E's sharp drum beat: "He's a Whore" kicks in, with Rick soloing like a deranged punk rocker. The soothing "Mandocello," named after the instrument it is played on (double strings tuned like a cello), can make you float away on a cloud of dreams. The last song from the original album, "Ballad or TV Violence," ends the original recording with a portrait of a mental murderer. When Cheap Trick played this song live, Rick used to open up his sweater to reveal a picture of the real life killer the song is about, crazy! This is a CD of a recording of when albums were albums, not just a collection of hit tunes. The songs move and support each other. This CD is made to be listened to in one sitting. Like Abbey Road by the Beatles, there is a cast of characters in the songs, some songs stand in isolation while others link into the next track, and a variety of instruments, tones, and textures keeps the selections fresh. The bonus material is good and interesting (like the early style of "I Want You To Want Me" they used to play live), but it is the high quality remix of the original recording that makes this CD a "must have" for any music lover. This is truly a masterpiece of music; the best Cheap Trick album ever (and that is saying a lot when you think about the fine albums that followed). This album had no flaws, and the only way to improve it was to remaster the tracks to let the brilliance of Cheap Trick shine through 
This is an incredibly eclectic collection of instrumental hits (and non-hits) released between 1957 and 1964. If you're in the mood for guitar solos only, or surf music only, or organ music only, then you're out of luck here--it's all mixed together! And I can't stop listening to it! You want to hear the Champs do "Tequila?" OK, it comes right after the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra and chorus doing "So Rare," which follows jazz-great Cozy Cole's awesome but really hard to find "Topsy Part II." This 30-cut essential CD finishes with a couple of Lonnie Mack tunes that prove he is one the R &amp; B guitar masters of this or any era. If you like this CD, go ahead and get Volumes 2 through 4. All of them contain a really smart mix of familiar tunes and stuff you've never heard before 
This cd is truly a blessing ..It's truly moving .I cant get pass the 1st song.What a blessing to my spirit .I have been blessed by every cd Juanita Bynum has made .Glory be to God for her obedience and love for the father ..To sum it up every cd she has ever made has been life changing for me ..May God continue to bless her and use her this precious woman of God. 
As a Christian, I love gospel music. As a longtime fan of Jonathan Butler, I buy anything with his name on it. I am not very familiar with the works of Juanita Bynum, but after hearing her sing and testify on this CD, I will definitely continue listening. I am waiting for the DVD! 
I love this CD. Two true worshippers come together with a symphony orchestra to produce an anointed project that ushers you into the presence of God 
I've always liked Juanita. I first heard Jonathan Butler on Israel Houghton's 'Alive In South Africa'CD and i was like, wow. I therefore had no choice than to pre-order this CD and i must confess that i am 100% not disappointed. This CD is filled with the annointing and not just talent. I like Jonathans passion for worship and it really ministers to me. I want to get the DVD for this whole event and i hope they make it. Juanita, i love you 
The soundtrack fits the movie perfecty. It's haunting, dark, mysterious, and, most of all, beautiful. I only really wanted the last song on the soundtrack, Follow Me, but I was forced to buy the soundtrack after iTunes refused to carry it for their US customers. Apparently they don't realize that music is a language that crosses all barriers. I'm glad I was forced into buying the soundtrack, though, because there's nothing like putting it on the CD player, and just letting it be background music while reading a particularly good book 
Dark, ethereal, and evolutionary, Kenji Kawai serves up a signature aural landscape for the sequel to Ghost in the Shell (GITS). For "Innocence" he reassembles many of the elements that made his original GITS soundtrack so unique: taiko percussion, female Japanese chorus, brooding electronica, while adding two original western Jazz-oriented tracks sung in English: "River of Crystals" and "Follow Me." With a nod to twentieth century classical music, "Follow Me" takes its motif from the second movement of Joaquin Rodrigro's "Concierto de Aranjuez" for guitar and orchestra. Usually, this sort of practice is disastrous but Kawai's arrangement and Kimiko Itoh's lush vocals make it work here. In a departure from the original GITS soundtrack, Kawai includes several high-energy tracks which make use of percussion and electronic riffs ("Attack the Wakabayashi") along with more dark, familiar brooding tracks such as "Etorofu." However it is on track #9, "Ballad of Puppets: The Ghost Waits in the World Beyond" that Kawai masterfully blends all his signature elements: female chorus, high energy taiko percussion, smart electronic riffs. During the movie, this track plays while Section 9 Operative Batou assaults the Gynoid Factory Ship. Kawai culminates the track by weaving in a choral theme from the original GITS Soundtrack associated with Major Motoko Kusanagi -- Batou's long lost partner. Highly recommended 
Personally, I love most of the songs on here, but it depends on what kind of music you're looking for. There are several tracks without words, and a few with. River of Crystals and Follow Me are my two most favorite, and are performed by a female vocalist. Both are in the movie, ROC being when Batou was heading to the store to pick up dog food, and FM being the end song. The rest, with vocals, are somber, multiple chorus singers, but they make the songs fit well. There are three different renditions of the beginning theme throughout the CD, which I enjoyed most. Both Doll House tracks also make it enjoyable, if you like creepy yet cool orchestrated music, which was playing when, well, Batou and Togusa entered The Doll House. I would buy this CD, but then again I am a hardcore Ghost in the Shell fan and I love all kinds of music. If you want upbeat, this isn't the CD for you. ^_ 
I want to buy this soundtrack but I am waiting for the tracks to appear. So, amazon, what do you waiting for? I've heard that this release has 17 tracks. that's good news. thank 
The songs just did not get me dancing. I have to say I was disappointed. But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl 
My son has just become a huge Sesame Street fan, but I didn't want to constantly plop him in front of the tv to give him his "Elmo" fix, so I decided to buy him this CD. I was hoping it would help him laugh, dance, and have fun with the characters without zoning out at the screen. And it has! He loves the CD and likes dancing along...especially to Happy Tappin' With Elmo. The first few times that I played the CD he kept staring at the screen on the tv to see where the characters were, but now he just yells out their names when he recognizes the voice. Very cute 
I bought this for a car trip when all we had was a cassette player about 4 years ago. My kids love it so much that the tape is worn out and i need to buy the CD. Some Elmo cd's can get a little annoying when played over and over (Elmo's high pitched voice is a little grating at times) but this one has enough variety that it does't bother me. It's really fun to dance to 
I bought this for my almost 2 year old son and my 3 year old daughter. They love it! It makes them dance and move around. Some of the songs they already know from Seasame Street and Play With Me Seasame but there are also songs they haven't heard before. I like it because it has a good variety of songs and it doesn't drive me crazy to hear it again and again. It has also been great to keep them entertained and having fun in the car as well as at home 
If you want your kids to get up and dance to your own familiar songs, get this cd. my girls love it and I had fun dancing with them as well. It has the great beats you'll like and the voices of the characters your kids will like 
My 20 month old son loves it. The moment he is buckled in his car seat he starts asking for the "Oley-song" (the first song on CD Hot, Hot, Hot). My son loves the entire CD but his favorite is the first one. My 6 year old daughter loves it too. They both dance and sing to it all the time. It is a must have CD for all kids! 
My 10 month-old son has loved this CD since we purchased it when he was around six months. My husband and I love it too. We consider ourselves two relatively cool people and a fear was listening to unoriginal, poorly done, and annoying childrens songs. This is definitely not the case here! The tunes and lyrics are amazing. The songs are sung by a variety of different characters and come from different dance genres (Disco, latin, caribbean, etc). This CD is great to put on when you and/or your little one has had a long day -- it provides an instant boost. A big thumbs-up! 
We have been listening to this album for over a year and it never gets old. My kids are 1 and 3 and they love it, and so do I!! The cookie monster at the disco is a great dance song! I highly recommend it 
I purchased this album for my young son and he loved it, nearly as much as my husbund! If we are in the car the first thing both of them want to listen to is Cookie Monster's "Me lost Me Cookie At The Disco", which I have to agree, is a fantastic song. It is this interaction that makes the whole album a must 
This album took awhile to really get to me. I got it as a gift and listened to it, thought it was pretty funny and put it on my shelf. Recently I brought it back out and it aged really, really well. The truth in what he is saying counter balances the offensive material so that he reveals offensive aspects of our society without embodying them. Likewise politically it's hard to really disagree with what he is saying because instead of just saying "Bush is stupid" he takes factual events and exploits the ignorance behind them. I heartily recommend this album and advise those who already own it to give it another listen. 
Biting, cynical, accurate ... but not that funny. Try Dave Attell's "Skanks for the Memories" for more laughs or Patton Oswalt's "Feelin' Kinda Patton" for better political and edgy comedy 
The negative reviews by uptight Christians are bonus material to the CD! So funny! The CD is hilarious. If you're a Republican, if you're a born-again Christian, or if you buy junk from QVC Home Shopping channel, you're going to have your feelings hurt. But really, let's face it - you probably deserve it. David Cross might never be a superstar, but he should be. In a perfect world, where people didn't believe in magic floating beings controlling the world, David Cross would be a superstar. In this world, Jeff Foxworthy gets his own TV show 
"My non-christian friends were raving about this CD. I listened to it to try to relate to them on their level, but I just couldn't do it. Between the continuous stream of profanity and the flat lies he tells about our President George W. Bush, it was all the self-control I had in me to stop myself from destroying my friend's CD. There's nothing remotely funny about this CD, unless you find treason or slander humorous. Save your money and go buy some real comedy" i find treason and slander extremely hilarious...........i guess im a mean person..... now try this: "I teach a Sunday school class and one of my students brought this in because I had requested all children to bring in a CD that inspires them. I consider myself pretty much up with youth trends as I take our youth group to many Christian rock concerts. I've also led panel discussions on "The Passion of Christ." When Mr. Cross started in saying he'd rather hear the death rattle of his only child rather than the sublime sounds of Creed I immediately turned off the CD and burst into tears. His acid-tinged tongue burned deep into the souls of the youth group students. He's right. It's not funny. Our group got over David's falsehoods by listening to Clay Aiken's newest record." this better be a joke the only thing worse than creed is clay aiken, actually i think it is a joke nevermind....... but this is really funny: "As an upset fan of both Creed and Evanescence (I've been into them since October), I would like to say that Mr. Cross really has no right to slander and malign these wonderful, spiritual bands who are only trying to do God's work on Earth. I'd like to see David Cross write something with the simple purity of "I will take you higher", or have the security in his born-again Christian heterosexuality to pose shirtless on an album cover. It's too bad that his relentless God-bashing got in the way of some genuinely funny routines about electric scissors and "Family Circus" cartoons. Now that is material that the whole family can enjoy. Previously, I had been a fan of Mr. Cross's work. I particularly enjoyed him in the blockbuster satiric masterpiece "Scary Movie 2", and of course I chuckle constantly at his wonderful voiceovers on Fox's heartwarming "Oliver Beene" show. It's just a shame that the influence of recreational drugs and the perks resulting from his success in Hollywood after his starring role in "Run Ronnie Run" have apparently led him astray and off of God's path. I will continue to pray for him and hope that he gets back to the kind of comedy that makes us laugh without having to resort to making fun of others. Of course, he'll never reach the level that Bill Engvall has, but it would be unfair to compare him to the greats." yea so in conclusion if you want to burn religious people's souls and you hate creed and other pseudo christian rockbands who are devoid of talent........and if you think bill engvall sucks or enjoy watching other people getting made fun of, then im pretty sure you'll enjoy this. its not quite as funny as these negative reviews i posted 
I knew David Cross from some parts in movies and of course in the best sitcom of the last 5 years: Arrested Development. I never knew he was a standup comedian until I checked his bio one time. And I was very surprised, he is really funny even though I didnt think he would be. In that way he looks a little like Steve Martin, who used to be a great comedian in the 70's. He really knows how to work with words and like any good comedian shows everyday stuff in a new light. Electric Scissors, Paris Hilton, Restaurants, Meatbulbs and 9-11. The political bits against rightwing conservatism are the best. His remark about freedom is great and could be used in a political speech. If the terrorist really hated freedom, The Netherlands would be dust... The titles of the tracks on the CD are misleading (as it the title of the album). Very long titles of nonsense but very funny. This album is great and guarenteed to make you laugh and look at things differently 
For those that just kind of went "ummmm, really, what?" after buying SUYFB hoping for some of the irrev...sardonically irreverent David Cross, but instead got some rambling basement bong chatter (in all fairness, still a couple of tasty nuggets in there), can find redemtion in this pre-packaged gem. Funny, clever, tight, thought provoking, edgey (hate that word but fits) cool, stand-up show. Get $3.00 in trade of $4.50 in credit at Zia Records (or whatever your local trade in store is) for SUYFB and lay it on this new one, also get one of those cool dragon bumper stickers by the cash register or a couple of jasmine incense sticks, whatever. Listen to this CD = good. Thank you David Cross, you've done it this time my good man, indeed. 
Cross is a brilliant, insightful comic, who can be political when it matters, yet silly and off the wall. Life imitates art: the bit on the Terror Alert, some guy flipping a switch when things look bad for BushCo. So true, it's sad 
Funnier than SUYFB and also a lot more focused. Topics include new parents, electric scissors, a lot about Bush and the government, freedom haters, freedom lovers, and a hidden track about the lead singer of Creed (and if you saw that idiot on Celebrity Poker Showdown you'll appreciate the bit) 
Extremely funny and insightful look into the brilliant mind of David Cross. 
Since this is my first outing with Spoon, I have no way to compare it with their previous works. However, if Gimme Fiction is any indication of the quality of previous albums, I am eager to hear more of them. My intro to Spoon came via an English music magazine, despite the fact that they are based a mere hundred miles from where I live. I chose Gimme Fiction as it seemed as good a CD with which to acquaint myself with their music than any other. One facet of the music I came to enjoy is the way the guitar is deftly used to underline or accent a musical sequence, rather than as a mere accompaniment to the lyrics. My favorites are The Beast and the Dragon, Adored with its Beatlesque vocals and blistering guitar licks, Two Sides of Monsieur Valentine with its steady and appealing beat, the snappy pop of Sister Jack, and the relentlessly driving and Beatlesque They Never Got You. On Gimme Fiction, Spoon sounds fresh and exciting. In popular music, the most danceable music generally is so vapid lyrically that those with elevated taste dismiss it out of hand. On the other hand, those who prefer dance music often dismiss quality "listening" music as elitist. With Gimme Fiction, you'll find that Spoon has managed to locate that rare intersection of quality and danceability. Check it out and you'll hear what I mean 
this album is a great representation of what spoon is about. great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one's ears. spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well. they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting. some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind, the two sides of monsieur valentine, sister jack and i turn my camera on. i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock. definately money well spent 
I like the main voice(s) and I like the music, but the voices are over powered by the music. If they turned up the voices a bit I think this would be a great album. This album does not sound like other albums I have so I'm not sure what to compare it to. 
Cool name for a band. Heavily bass-driven. Extremely catchy pop-rock. With awesome vocalist. And great use of piano. Thats really all there is to say, right? Well, more or less. Listen to the opening of "Beast and Dragon, Adored." If that doesn't strike you as a ridiculously catchy and cool opening, then turn off this album and burn your ears (Kerosene + match). Otherwise, buy it, because you'll love it. Tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are especially excellent. Last 3 or so songs are OK but not as good as the stuff before. Oh, and "I Turn My Camera On" is a good song that in all probability will (ahem) take you to Funky-town. 
This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say "when is this gonna get going?" and none of them ever do. It's like slow-motion bland-pop 
I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album 
The first time I heard, "I Turn My Camera On" was on a television commercial. I turned up the volume and Wow! I couldn't wait to hear it again. It's sexy and whimsical beat reminds me of 70's glam rock. luv it 
After about the third listen to this album the feeling hit me like a ton of bricks...rock and roll still lives. "Gimme Fiction" is really a fantastic album. It's tight, subversive, full of soul, clever, and certainly destined to get scant radio play. It's so catchy, the songs have been in my head for days, yet I still listen. In my opinion, there really isn't an unworthy track on this CD. The first half of the album is the strongest, just a really sly group of songs. I almost think Spoon outdid themselves, yet "I Summon You", "Was it you" and "They Never Got You" round out the rest of the album superbly. I suppose that is the master ingredient: this is a record which summons you, the listener, instead of one that just plays at you. The music is direct and powerful. Once the feeling hits, you'll realize that this is what rock and roll is all about. 
I had never heard Spoon or any of their stuff until about a week ago and downloaded this album online. It's good stuff. I'm not too sure which genre of music these guys fit into. I guess you could say these guys are Indie. Really it doesnt even matter. I would describe this album as dramatic, and generally just "cool" music. Its the type of music I could see underlying another medium, whether TV commercials or as soundtrack material in a Motion Picture. For instance, this would have fit right into a soundtrack like "Igby Goes Down". The production itself is disorganized and sometimes even chaotic, probably intentionally. This isnt uplifting or energy-promoting music, but a necessary album to have in one's collection. Its more somber and reflective if anything. Fans of all genre's could find something in this that they like. The majority of the album is solid, with only a few tracks i might dump (sister jack, the infinite pet, I summon you). Standouts for me include The Delicate Place and My Mathematical Mind (which has a very cool beginning) but every other song besides the three I listed as weak are solid tracks not to be missed. I recommend it 
I'll admit right off the bat that I'm not exactly a sucker for the indie rock scene that is so hot right now. In fact, the only reason I knew who Spoon were was because they were billed as the opening act on Weezer's summer tour last year. Being that I held a ticket to one of those shows, I felt the urge to look into Spoon and subsequently aquired their entire discography. A few days after doing so, Spoon dropped off our date for mysterious reasons, and I had all these CD's by a band I hardly even know. Do I regret it? Not now. After sitting on my shelves for almost a year, I figured "Why put all that money to waste" and I have started to really enjoy Spoon. I honestly didn't think I would, but I do. It's amazing to me that these guys haven't been getting the attention earned by the likes of Death Cab for Cutie or Modest Mouse. These guys are simply a notch above what's going on today. With a bit of retro 60's/70's rock, dance and funk, Spoon's latest album "Gimme Fiction" is simply a please-all afair. The true standouts among this collection are "My Mathematical Mind," "I Turn My Camera On" and "They Never Got You," but every song is excellent and has something different to offer. You could list off a thousand influences -- from the Rolling Stones to The Pixies -- but Spoon sound like nobody else. These days, that's nearly impossible to come by. Had I not experienced the circumstances by which I came to know Spoon, they surely would have slipped under my radar. And that's a shame. These guys have what it takes to be one of the biggest acts today, but your next door neighbor probably has no idea who they are 
There's been a lot of debate over the years as to whether this is one of Stevie's best albums or one of his worst. I suppose it depends on one's point of view but even I have to admit I was taken slightly aback when I first listened to it. But that was many years ago and it's grown on me, taking its rightful place as one of my favourite albums of all time. Stevie did go against a lot of what he had done before but he was just breaking new ground. I think it was a brave move on his part and personally, I think history has proved him right. It's a solid set of ten songs and Stevie seems to try a different idea, a different approach with each of them. This is what attracted the criticism of the album being all over the place but while it's eclectic all right, the songs all fit together. Stevie ensures they do with the way he times one song to start immediately after the end of the one before it with no break - something he's done on many of his albums. "All I Do" is notable for having Michael Jackson peforming background vocals, alongside Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Jamil Raheem and Betty Wright. That might not mean anything now but this was back in 1980 just after Jackson's "Off The Wall". (Michaelmania hadn't quite taken off but it was definitely on its launch pad). The only other person who was able to snag Jackson for backing vocal duties back then (apart from Quincy Jones, that is), was Kenny Rogers, for a song on his "Share My World" album. "All I Do" has also been covered by many r singers in the intervening years but not as much as "Lately". This is easily one of Stevie's most beautiful songs and it's just him, his piano and bass synthesizer. The line "Lately I've been staring in the mirror" didn't really register until years later, when I was like, hang on, this man is blind. Another of my favourites is "Do Like You", a funky dance tune featuring the voices of Stevie's (then young) children, Aisha and Keita. I had this album on cassette until recently when I got the CD. The first time I heard the sound of glass breaking at the end of the song, it sounded so real, I actually looked up to see what had broken. Bizarre. The other songs of mention are "Master Blaster (Jammin')", which I didn't get then and still don't get now. I can see where Stevie is coming from but I really think reggae is best left to the experts. "Cash In Your Face" deals with the unpleasant but undenialble issue of racism. The song tells the story of a young black family man looking for an apartment and being stonewalled by the landlord or real estate agent. The prospective tenant's voice is pleading and desperate, while the landlord's is cold and unmoving. I'd been listening to the album for several months before I realised that Stevie was singing both parts - one an octave lower than the other. Brilliant. And then, finally, there's "Happy Birthday" and the only use I've found for it over the years is, as a DJ, playing it at birthday parties and getting the guests to dance around the celebrant. It works a treat every time. That said, this song was the vocalisation of the campaign Stevie started to get Martin Luther King, Jr's birthday recognised. Given that it's now a public holiday in the US, I'd say that all on its own makes this entire album pretty iconic. I'm not sure it's his best; "Songs In The Key Of Life" wins that honour hands down, but it's definitely (one of) his most culturally influential 
I purchased this CD because it has the tune "Happy Birthday" honoring Martin Luther King. I have the LP, but wanted to have a means of preserving this music. The whole CD is excellent listening and vintage Stevie sounds 
....and that's exactly what a great magician like Stevie Wonder will do.... I didn't think this album held gas compared to his 70s stuff..... but man..... he kind of put me in this trance..... he's just got something that I can't describe... it's like each of his songs build up and climax near the end... he just starts going nuts with his voice and instruments... it's good stuff!!! 
It's hard to find a Stevie Wonder CD where almost every song is good. I own several of them and am a huge fan. My favorites on this CD are Rocket Love, All I Do, and Lately. The only song that I don't like is Happy Birthday. Buy it and you won't be sorry...I personally feel that it is one of his best!!! 
What an amazing CD this is. Originally released in 1980 and still sounding up to date. Not as great as his 70s masterpieces, but hey, still a fabulous outing, with varying musical influences and outstanding songwriting. The album made it to No.3 on the Billboard album charts. The tribute to Bob Marley, `Master blaster (jammin')' is a delightful lilting reggae number with great horns and outstanding vocals, which made No.5 in the US and the UK top 10. There's the mid tempo, disco-tinged, synth driven `All I do' featuring backing vocal;s from Michael Jackson (repaying the favour for Stevie's `I can't help it' from his `Off the wall' album the previous year) and a great sax break. `Rocket love' is a tender atmospheric ballad with great `Do do do...', dramatic strings, and lyrics comparing a woman's love to a ride in a rocket. Classic Stevie! `I aint gonna stand for it' (a UK top 10 and US no.11) features backing vocals from the Gap Band (whose vocal styling was clearly inspired by Stevie), and is an upbeat song with faint country elements in the verses, which connects to the next song, `As if you read my mind' with a great piano bridge. Percussion on this song is outstanding. Other standouts are the tender much covered piano ballad `Lately' (a UK top 10) featuring an achingly passionate delivery from Stevie, and closing track, the sunny, poppy `Happy Birthday' which was a tribute to Martin Luther king Jr, and was a part of the push to get his birthday declared a national holiday, which it eventually was. It was a real hot July.... 
I'll be the first to admit that it took me a solid 4 or 5 times of listening too it before I really liked it. This album is very much "80's" and is quite different from Wonder's previous masterpieces. It took me a while to get used to this new style Stevie was using, but after that it stands in my mind as a truly great album. One thing about any of his albums is that they do not lack any depth lyrically, Hotter than July is no exception. He's on point as ever with "Rocket Love" "Cash In Your Face". Musically this album is more fast paced and jams more so than his previous efforts. "Did I Hear You Say You Love Me", is a great groove and "I Ain't Gonna Stand For It" is a quite impressive track with the inclusion of country elements. "Do Like You" is a solid track, and perhaps the only one I skip is "As if You Read My Mind" (You might not though). What makes this album work more than any other factor is musical gems found on here. "All I Do" "Master Blaster" are both classics in his catalogue of course "Lately" is one of his finest (both musically and lyrically). "Happy Birthday" is also essential if only because of its historical value. Despite the strength of some individual tracks it does lack the overall as an album that we've previously come to expect with Wonder. But, what you have is a 45 min run time album that is just full of solid tracks. It's truly a testament to Stevie Wonder that, while many great artists of the 70's collapsed when they tried to adapt to the 80's style (look no further than Led Zeppelin), he was able to still convey his musical genius. This album is definitely not a masterpiece, nor close to touching the genius of his previous albums. Perhaps it's not his best, but does that take away from it? Are we just too spoiled by his previous efforts? Bottom line: It's still simply a great album and only further adds on to Wonder's legacy. One of the best albums released from the 80's era 
Here is Stevie Wonder's initial project for the 1980's. This album was released in or around September 1980. According to Norm N. Nite's Rock On Almanac,MASTER BLASTER debuted on the radio that month. Wonder did not have hits at all earlier that year. I like I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT which was later covered by Eric Clapton. I heard several songs on Music Choice's Classic R channel. One of them was ALL I DO. Anyway,it's a very good album. This is one of five albums that Wonder released in the 80's 
I love this album. Stevie is a wonderful talented artist. I love this whole album it contains some wonderful songs. My favorite songs on here is the remarkable song tribute to M.L.K. "Happy Birthday" I love this song. I love lately,All I do, Rocket Love, and Master Blaster Jammn'. This is a great album Stevie always does great work 
After Stevie released the confused experimental record, "Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants", he returned to his R roots and released "Hotter Than July". This is the true follow-up to his 1976 double-album masterpiece, "Songs In The Key Of Life". "Hotter Than July" is a very straightforward pop record because of its 80's production and sound. It's a more glossy production. The opening, "Did I Hear You Say You Love Me", is an upbeat dance number with energetic synthesizer and guitar hooks. "All I Do" is one of the best songs on this album. It's a funk/disco-type track with a oh-so-fly beat. "Rocket Love" is probably my favorite song on this disc. It's a sexy ballad with Stevie talking about a woman any man would be incensed by, who would depart too soon with his love. The song, itself, has a variety of synthesizers and drum machines being played throughout the song. It's just a classic. Next, there's "I Aint Gonna Stand For It", which is a country/pop-type tune with laid-back slide guitar hooks. "As If You Read My Mind" is one of my personal favorites on here. The song has a tropical vibe in it. The drum beats have a reggae feel in them. "Master Blaster (Jammin')" is a reggae tune in the sprit of and in tribute to Bob Marley. "Do Like You" is a funky ode to Stevie's son, who dreams of being a dancer. "Cash In Your Face" is the only downside on this album. The rhythms are not-so even, but the song is worth a listen. It has a message of housing and job discrimination. It really takes me back to the Innervisions period, where he was at his political peak. "Lately" is just a classic. It's a lovely ballad that has him playing a piano and bass synthesizer, I think. It's probably the best composition Stevie has done. "Happy Birthday" is a celebration of the heart of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King. The song makes you celebrate life. It was really a vocal plea for making Dr. King's birthday recognized as a national holiday. It's an exciting song. Overall, "Hotter Than July" is a consistent and great album. I consider this as his best album from the 80's-era. The synthesizers are a little dated, but the rhythms are top notch. They vary so much that it is a wonder that they are all inside the mind of one man and that they can all be delivered from a genius. All I can say is that it's a great follow-up to Songs In The Key Of Life. "Hotter Than July" is quite a sheer of artistic brilliance. This is truly a disc that you will play over and over again. A 
This is a hot album if you love Bachata! These songs are romantic and sentimental. Andy Andy's sexy voice and passionate beats are sure to please! Andy Andy! Eh 
The 1990s music landscape saw Alternative Rock begin to basically become part of the mainstream music fold. However, Alternative Rock also began to produce many other off-shoots. This was because there was a perception that groups such as "Nirvana" and "Gin Blossoms" would "sell out" to commercial culture. As a result, a sub-movement within Alternative Rock began to form called "Indie Rock". The "Indie" stands for independent. It is a style of music that often covers a wide variety of genres, often working on independent record labels, but most importantly the artist maintains complete control of the music and their careers. However as Indie Rock stars gained popularity, even this term began to blur a bit. One artist who rose to popularity in the Indie Rock movement was Edwin McCain. Edwin McCain's second album "Misguided Roses" produced one of the biggest hits of 1997 and 1998 called "I'll Be". While I always felt that this was an overrated song, it did give McCain's career the boost it needed. While McCain's commercial success might have put his "Indie Rock" status in question, his style would still remain true to the "Indie Rock" roots. It would be McCain's third album, "Messenger" that would show his "Indie Rock" roots. Surprisingly, this album didn't garner the critical acclaim that I would have expected. As mentioned, a key facet to the "Indie Rock" movement is maintaining complete control of the music - in other words, doing things your own way. For the most part, with McCain, this is not an issue. The sound on "Messenger" by McCain is as "Coffee House" as you can get. There is a lot of use of acoustic (even if it is electric acoustic) guitars. McCain supplements this sound very nicely with the use of saxophones and horns. He also makes a stronger use of drums and percussions than most "Coffee House" style artists. McCain is also one very talented songwriter. As for doing things "his own way", this is very evident on "Messenger". McCain penned 11 of the 12 tracks. One might give him some criticism for using a song ("I Could Not Ask For More") written by a very "commercial songwriter" like Diane Warren, but McCain puts his own spin on that track. After all, part of Indie Rock is doing things your own way - and that is very evident on that track. McCain's songwriting includes a wide variety of topics. Most notably, McCain's spirituality surfaces in the song "A Prayer to St. Peter". This is an acoustic sounding song that I'm shocked didn't garner more attention on the Christian Contemporary circuit. While McCain does include other spiritual/religious references on "Messenger" (such as "Ghost of Jackson Square", "Sign on the Door", "Beautiful Life", and even on Warren's "I Could Not Ask For More"). I would say it's safe to say that McCain is a Christian influenced musician. McCain also sings on other topics - such as a tribute to his grandmother ("See Off This Mountain"); Alcoholism ("Sign on the Door" and "Go Be Young"); and of course love and romance ("Wish In This World", "Promise of You", I'll Be") As far as McCain's songwriting goes, it is his use of metaphors that really hits home. While I did feel "I'll Be" was an overrated song, this was a song that did use metaphors very well (i.e. "Emeralds from mountains thrust from the sky", "Rain falls angry on the tin roof"). McCain carries this trademark over to "Messenger". This is seen on several tracks such as: "Wish in this World" ("Running to grass so green; Dangerous road, but it's not going to change"); "Ghost of Jackson Square" ("But fall from the height; my personal ledges; afraid to look down; my crepe paper bridges; enough water to drawn"); "Prayer to St. Peter" ("The taste of summer; and a ripened pear; and girls sweet as meadow wind"); and Sign on the Door ("With a Sign on the Door; Saying sorry we're closed"). Throughout the album, the balance between McCain's haunting vocals and the outstanding work done by his band are really done well. There isn't a bad track on this collection. Perhaps the best example of the balance between the vocals and band work is on "Go Be Young". This song got a lot of airplay and deserved it - it is the best track on the album. "I Could Not Ask for More" also get some attention as well - and also well deserved. There are many other tracks that I'm surprised didn't garner more airplay or attention - such as "Wish In This World", "Beautiful Life", "Prayer to St. Peter", "Ghosts of Jackson Square", and "Do Your Thing". "Sign on the Door" is another standout track that takes on almost a gospel-like feel toward the end of the track. My only criticism of "Messenger" is the inclusion of the "acoustic" version "I'll Be". I almost feel that this was included to capitalize on the big success of "I'll Be". Ok, it was a popular song and there may be a market to hear a more "acoustic" sound, but I think this would have been better suited for a greatest hits album. I had mentioned that McCain did things his own way "for the most part". Perhaps the record company put some pressure to include this. While you can say this violates the spirit of the Indie Rock movement, you can also say that perhaps McCain wanted to include this - and did things his own way. The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to all of the songs as well as the musician and production credits. While "Messenger" would be a commercial success, that would be the last album that McCain would have commercial success. McCain would return to his Indie roots of touring and word of mouth music. But "Messenger" proved that Indie Music can be good even it does sell well. Highly recommended 
This is simply one of my top 20 favorite CD's of all-time. I'm 40 years old, and have heard a lot of 'albums' and trust me, this one is right in there. If you like Edwin at all, you will love this album 
This is one of my very favorite cds. By far the best by Edwin McCain, and among the best albums I've ever heard. Buy it. Get an extra copy for a friend 
Edwin Mcwinain. what can I say about him? I'm 17 years old and when I went to a concert of his, because his following is not all that large (what a shame) most people were surprised to see a person so young, there. they asked me how I knew about him. I said that I had heard him on the show "Dawson's Creek" a few years before and fell in love with his music. I have this CD ("Messenger") and I highly recommend it. Edwin's lyrics are so beautiful and meaninful and his voice is sooo sooothing. Edwin has that great combo of Pop, Blues, Jazz, Country and Rock, ALL INTO ONE! it's hard to explain but I love it. I met him once a few months ago and I'm going to see him again next week 
This is my personal favorite. It's a shame McCain doesn't have a greater following. Everything on this album is poetic in every sense. The instrumentation is fantastic and the lyrics, the true brilliance of the music, are amazing. There is a fantastic acoustic version of "I'll Be" that is quieter, tamer and features the lyrics, though it loses the wonderful saxophone pieces that are that song's trademark. True to that, this album is quieter all around, with the noteable exception of "Anything Good About Me," which is really the only 'rock' song here. "Beautiful Life" and "Just Do Your Thing" are eloquent commentaries on life today. Though this album doesn't have much of the upbeat tunes like "Guinevere" or "Alive" common to Edwin McCain's earlier albums, it is poetic an moving. Edwin McCain's best songs are rarely released on the radio waves and anyone who misses them is really missing out 
I heard "I'LL BE" first on the radio and thought, "Who IS that guy?" Then, when I was living in San Diego, he was a guest at the local radio station and performed "Beautiful Life" in the studio. Since then, I've ordered every CD and I play them in the pub where I work in Germany. I just can't get enough of Edwin McCain. His writing is true to the heart. I think he is WAY underrated and I hope he never feels that he's not getting the recognition he deserves, even though he ISN'T. His following may be small but it's solid and forever 
let's get one thing straight - this is a fantastic cd. i've been looking for the "i'll be" single for months on end when i found this cd in a second-hand store, mint condition. i bought it for a bargain price and i was blown away by each song, right from the start. "wish in this world" and "go be young" are great songs, while "promise of you" and the two ballads are prom-worthy love songs... i cannot say enough about edwin mccain, i just wish that they'd come down here so i can hear them live 
I bought this CD over a year ago, and it has rarely left the player. McCain's voice is haunting, both when he is singing larger than life rock and when he is doing acoustic pieces. "Beautiful Life" and "Wish in this World" are definitely highlights, but I don't think there is a bad song on here. I even like "I Could Not Ask for More." You appreciate it more when you here the limp version done by country artist Sara Evans. The lyrics are intelligent and well written, and CD showcases true artistry and musicianship. Listening to this kind of makes you wonder why all that overproduced junk on the radio is so popular. Get this CD to hear some true music 
This album was not created by a mere mortal. This album was made by God himself, and handed down to the greatest rapper of our time, Randy Savage. Macho Man shows range that the written word just doesnt do justice. If this album doesnt go platinum 10 times over than the greatest tragedy of our generation has occured. Move over Sgt. Pepper, the greatest album ever is ready to take its throne 
First of all, we have to review this album objectively. I, too, have been laughing at the clearly sarcastic reviews for Macho's rap endeavor. It is hard not to. The mere thought of Macho Man wrestling is hilarious -- let alone expanding his scope. As time as gone on, it seems the "Madness" has ceased to even be a character, but rather the real thing. Kind of scary. And in a way, this CD confirms that the real "Macho Man" is not far from the man waving his fingers around and growling nonsense in those interviews... Even still, the guy deserves a fair review. And from a Macho Man fan (who is a fan precisely because the guy is certifiably insane, which made him a hell of a wrestler), but far from a rap fan, that is even more difficult. But let's define what 5-star rap would be, for this purpose. 5-star rap would be old Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Nelly. I am not going to even try to analyze these artists, but they are the most respected for a reason: the beats are catchy, the lyrics are skillfully delivered, and mostly there is nothing forced about it. These guys are naturally rappers. That said, it's pretty clear that Macho Man is pretty bad. Even if we say that his voice isn't bad, it's just "not conventional." It's still bad. The beats are cheesy and regurgitated. The production is third or fourth rate. The clichï¿½s are endless. It takes itself far too seriously (right from the intro on, where some girl talks about how "hot" Macho Man is). And the lyrics, far from flowing, are all cut up into brutal couplets that sound like kids' poetry trying to sound "raw." I found the clichï¿½s especially ridiculous. Far from a rap or hip-hop guru, I heard more than a few gimmicks borrowed right from popular pop-radio rappers. There is a wonderful Nate-Dogg-like crooner in "What's This All About" -- a perfect imitation of the deep rap vibrato from hits like "Regulators," but the credits confirm, not really Nate Dogg. The "Uh-Oh!" from "Gonna Be Trouble" is hijacked from a Nelly CD. "Be a Man" has a cheesy over-dramatized synthesized horn in the chorus. "Perfect Friend" even accompanies Macho's monotone poetry reading with "N'Sync." I gave the CD away, so I don't remember, but I think at one point the legendary DJ Cool says to "throw your hands in the air and wave them like you don't care." An automatic disqualifier for anything trying to be anything. But the real disaster are the lyrics and delivery. Macho's voice isn't good, but it might have worked since some of the Southern rappers from the "Crunk" school do kind of resemble that approach. But these couplets are just bad. Macho Man plays his card right when he approaches the songs like a wrestler -- stressing his toughness and the fact that he could beat you up. But the way he gets that across is a caricature. "Be a Man" is the best example. The classic rap vendetta song, this kind of works. Beating on Hulk's movies is a definite point-getter in those MC Battles (even if the "feature role in Spiderman" is a slight stretch). But the chorus is a disaster, indicative of the lyrical shortcomings of the entire album, so trapped in rhymed couplet after rhymed couplet that those couplets come out like thug versions of Hallmark Cards. Case in point: "All he is is a chump (?)... because Hulk Hogan is a real big punk." It sounds like the kind of reaction that happens on the playground when one adversary runs out of clever insults... "Well you're...... a real big punk!" The general dynamic is not much better. The beats aren't great but might sound "harder" if Macho did not grab at any bad lyric he could find: "I'm bad for your health and about ready to blow," as another example. Some variation would help too...... too loud, all the same pace, repeated themes...... either "I'm tough and am going to beat you up" or (more disturbing) "I'm really sexy and when I walk into the club the ladies are all over me" With no cleverness to the assertion, the whole CD is remarkably limiting. I'm not sure how far you can take these pretty mundane concepts, but other rappers take things that are not that much more interesting and make a hell of a lot more of them -- as in making it not a headache road to nowhere to listen to the album all the way through. That said, it is important to remember that Macho Man is a wrestler first, a rapper second, and this is his first CD. But, this said...... this still never should have been released, it has no place on the market, and is a terrible waste of money. Macho Man made it pretty clear that he thought that he was really good. I saw him promote the CD on TV, and the reporter literally toyed with him in buttering up his opinion of how good he was. And herein lies the problem. He got an idea in his head and some record company used his fame to make a few bucks off of it. He was exploited, if that can fairly be stated. Could Macho Man have released a good rap CD? Good? No. But if it recognized its own limitations, took itself less seriously, and focused on being fun and humble rather than a beggar's imitation of real rap........ it could have had its place. For me? I bought it as a novelty, and it doesn't even have it's place on the novelty shelf. It's lyrically and musically boneheaded; even its "emotional" finish -- no doubt heartfelt -- is forced into a box to the point where it joins the oblivion. Listening to this is like watching a train crash. For Macho's sake: watch his wrestling matches, do not rate him on this. He is among the greatest in some things......... he is a disaster in rap. All joking aside. 
Before this cd I thought Macho Man was only capable of wrestling and slim jim commercials....well I was wrong! Honestly, the only song I've listened to is Perfect Friend, but it doesnt matter bc that song alone is platinum status. I love the fact that Macho was able to get my favorite basketball player, Montell Jordan, to do the chorus. Genius. I will admit I was a little disappointed that there wasnt a collaboration with Dereck Jeter....oh well, save it for Album #2 
This is the quintessential rap album of the past 15 years. And while I haven't actually heard the entire thing--only listening to the short blurbs offered here on the site, I did hear influence gleaned from some such visionary artists' recordings as The Olsen Twins' "Toys (When I Grow Up)"; Milli Vanilli's "Dance With A Devil"; John Tesh's "Bastille Day"; and anything from the Aaron Carter pantheon. While none of the above are actually rappers, though MC Tesh did dabble in the Gansta genre for a few dazzling months, this diversity is what makes Macho Man's masterpiece such a shift in the rap paradigm. In fact, upon further analysis, Macho's contribution isn't rap; it is something far and away better--a completely new echelon of musical style. I therefore dub what he has done on this watershed recording "WWrap", because it envelopes ("wraps") all that is good in music, and pays homage to the institution which gave us this mind-blowing genius. Well done, Mr. Man. Well done. 
To all the player haters out there- screw youze. Don't blame the man for trying. Its not his fault that somebody didn't have the sac to tell him this was probably a bad idea. I mean, after battering his body in the ring for years the whole time carrying a God-like complex to the tune of millions of screaming, frothing fans, this mid-life crisis is fifty times cooler than anything your meaningless, pathetic life with ever belch forth. Your mid-life crisis will no doubt be comprised of binge-drinking and frequent masturbation coupled with violent crying. I will never open it, let alone listen to it , but I am buying this album and rating it 5 stars on the grounds that no matter what, Savage deserves the support of the entire human race. You should do the same. Anybody who knows anything about Randy Savage and professional wrestling knows he was and still is the greatest professional wrestler of all time. He had better mic skill than Bret Hart, better in-ring skill than Austin and brought an intangible feeling of unpredictability to every match he was involved in. Nobody has ever been able to duplicate that feeling. Not Michaels. Not The Rock. Not El Dandy- nobody. Hell, Savage carried Hogan- the one trick pony in his match at Wrestlemania 5. And Savage, with the presence of mind to know when to retire from the ring hasn't disgraced his legacy like so many others making "return" after "return" only to stumble around in the ring like they have a load in their tights. And no matter what, never forget this- Randy Savage may not have made the greatest rap album, but regardless- he could still kick the living crap out everybody rating it less than five. Ohhhhh Yeah! 
This is an open letter to Macho Man Randy Savage: Dear Mr. Savage, Why? Why did you make this album? Why did you do this to us and to yourself? Do you realize that you have probably released one of the worst albums ever recorded to ANY medium? Please reconsider selling any more copies of this album, as well as any future releases and/or re-releases. Thank you. Sincerely, The Management. 
The only reason I give this album a 2 instead of a 1 is because the production was very well put together. Lyrically this album is garbage. I give him an A for effort but as far as rapping skills go, he gets a F 
After years of hard work and dedication in the wrestling business, Macho Man Randy Savage proves that today's modern man is a multi-tasker. Be A Man combines soothing lyrics to hip beats and creates an aural experience never heard before. He shows his versatility in songs such as Be A Man, where he aggressively "disses" rival Hulk Hogan, and songs like A Perfect Friend, where his tender side is revealed in a ballad-like eulogy to his fallen ally in the squared circle, Kurt Hennig. I give the album three thumbs up and hope that you all can enjoy it as much as I did 
As of 2006, ColdPlay's X stands as one of the best albums of the 21st century to date. This album just rings with the sound of a classic album. If "Speed of Sound" and "Talk" wasn't enough to make it great, "What If" and "Fix You" put this album in a class with The Joshua Tree, The Wall, etc. for shear greatness. The songs throughout are anthemic. Coldplay's live shows are an amazing experience. Don't hesitate on this one, it's a "must have" 
This album is awesome. I wasn't really that exposed to Coldplay. Since buying this, i bought their other two albums. They're awesome 
Musically dull; vaguely reminiscent of The Cure but not as good. I was given this CD as a gift. After listening to it, I told her she could keep it. 
Wow! Just when you're wondering if Coldplay can keep it up or have blown all their cookies producing Parachutes and A Rush of Blood..., boy, do they kick you in the pants to put you straight. This is more complex, more dynamic, simply more dazzling than anything they've produced so far (well, except for The Scientist. Doubt if they'll ever top that!). Too cool by far. If you loved their other stuff, boy, are you going to writhe in ecstacy over this. Best tracks? I could say all of them, but if I have to narrow it down - What if?, Swallowed in the Sea, 'Til Kingdom Come. Buy this 
Songwriting and music equals that of A Rush of Blood to the Head. Possibly a more mature sound. 
I would have written a review for this album sooner, but I was too busy listening. It will be hard to top this record. Every song is absolutely amazing. I haven't heard a record with this much mood since Pink Floyd's "dark side of the moon", I truely believe this record will hold its place with phenomenal albums such as the above mentioned. FIX YOU, has a special place in my heart and will until the day I die. 
I never was able to get into coldplay until about a month before the release of X For no reason at all, the other albums just clicked and Coldplay became, quite quickly, one of my favorite bands. It took a few listens to really appreciate the album. As other reviewers have pointed out, the sound is steadily similar throughout the album, but after getting familiar with each individual track, you realize that each is very different from each other. I found the best time to listen to this CD is at nighttime, especially if you happen to be driving in a rural part of the country (like in the midwest, or down central California). At those times, with gleeming stars overhead, there is nothing like blasting X to get the spacey feeling that only coldplay could produce. A brief overview of each song: Square One- No better way to open the album than this song. Its ambitious, rockin (for coldplay standards) and at a decently high musicanship level. Great song What If- Can be a little monotomous, but absolutely beautiful. White Shadows - When I first heard this song, i thought the refrain was great, but hated the rest of the song. However, after listening maybe 5-10 times, it grew to be one of my favorites on the album. The guitaring especailly makes this song special. Fix You- Lyrically and musically, this is one of Coldplays most advanced songs. Starting out so quietly with the organ, and then ending with pure rock (again, coldplay standards) and beautiful harmony. This song is the one that will define the album such as Clocks did for their last. Talk- The only song I dont like. The main riff is OK, but they play it to death and then his melody is just the riff again. This one is the only downside to the album X another epic song, and also very musical. This one I liked right away Speed Of Sound- I would have preferred they left this off the album and just released it as a single, but it is a catchy song, a little too similar to clocks, but solid A message- Took me a while, but I eventually love the spacey feel to this song. It creates such an emotional yearning if you listen closely. Really great. Low- My favorite song on the album. This one will probably slip under the radar, but it had a great base (not bass guitar, but the riff the song is built on). The melody is very creative and I think defines coldplay perfectly. The Hardest part- probably the poppiest song on the album. Its catchy, not much substance to it, but fits nice and snug on the album Swallowed in the Sea- This one progresses throughout the song, building and building. Absolutly gorgeous song. Twisted Logic- Seemes like they were just having fun, and they created a futuristic sound to go along with their lyrics well. Good way to close the album (sorta, close it, they have a "secret" song, see below) Till Kingdom Comes- RIP johnny cash, Coldplay did a nice little diddy for him here, simple acoustic and not much range in the melody, accomplishes everything they were trying to. Most of all I love this album because I think, contrary to some reviewers, it was a big step away from A Rush of Blood to the Head. This one had much more production (the ambient sounds they put in the backround and such) and I see it as a important stepping stone to what I think will be Coldplays new sound that will come along with their next album. They are growing and its showing. I love this album. 
Good, solid album by Coldplay. Speed of Sound and X Y are my top two songs on the album. I wish they made more songs like X Y. Its a nice blend of slow and semi-fast music. It seems like I always find 3-4 songs I really like in each album, it takes a bit to get used to too, BUT if you give Coldplay a chance, you'll never turn back.............. 
Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say "Haven't we heard this before?" I don't really dislike the sound, but X is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music. 
First off, please ignore the spotlight reviews. Hinder opened for Nickelback during their summer tour. They're both part of Universal Music Group. So if Nickelback had a real problem with their music, I'm sure they wouldn't have allowed them on tour. There are definitely similarities, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If you like Chad Kroeger's rough, raspy voice then Hinder frontman Austin Winkler's voice is an even bigger treat. Winkler's voice is even more raw and distorted. It sounds more like a special effect, but it's not. It's the real thing. That's where you'll probably hear the big difference besides song selection. Nickelback's Chad Kroeger has a unique talent for writing catchy Rock/Metal songs that get tons of radio play. Hinder is just getting their footing on this record, but you can hear the potential for similar success. And also, I'll agree with others that Austin Winkler is reminiscent of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. If you go to Hinder's website [...] you'll see that they're actually opening for Aerosmith on a few dates of their tour. But I think "Extreme Behavior" is a good starting point for this band. I have to disagree that they're "hindered by unoriginality." Both Hinder and Nickelback are more 80's style Rock bands. There are a lot of good songs on Hinder's album that require repeat listens. Beyond what most have heard on the radio "Lips of an Angel," there's my personal favorite "Better than Me." Although, this album was released over a year ago, radio and the general public really didn't catch onto it until late summer. So this album is still new for most people. I'm definitely looking forward to a second album from them. I love the voices of both Austin Winkler and Chad Kroeger. So if you like Nickelback, then I would give Hinder a chance also. There will be many bands along the way that want to be and try to sound like Nickelback. But the only one worthy of being considered a compliment, understudy, apprentice, follow-up, or heir apparent is Hinder. Favorites: Get Stoned, How Long, By the Way, Better Than Me, Lips of an Angel, Homecoming Queen, Should 
Extreme Behavior is quite a good album. They are like a derivation of Nickelback and Staind and maybe some Stone Sour. If you're a fan of those bands, Extreme Bahavior is for you. Maybe you will find a little generic touch in a few tracks, like the magic of experimentation has run dry in one or two tracks (I'll let you decide that), but strong instrumentalization and deep vocals make up for whatever is lacking. This band stands out among the many. The hit songs Get Stoned and Lips of an Angel deserve every inch of respect given to them. For Hinder's next release I hope they are way more experimental with guitar effects which will give them more of an atmospheric sound. Adding some keyboards will be a good addition too. Overall, out of 5 stars they get a 4.55. Pick this up for sure 
When I first heard them, I thought they were Nickelback. Good sounding CD. Their first hit "Get Stoned" didn't receive a lot of airplay, at least not around here. Saw the video which made me get the cd. They will be an up and coming group. If you are a NickelBack fan, you'll enjoy this CD 
Some of the songs continue to be my favorites, but all of them are very good 
I saw this band in concert with Nickleback - they were fabulous! The cd is just as great. The lead singer has a similarity to Steven Tyler 
Very good new band. Like "Get Stoned" and "Lips Of An Angel" a lot 
Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings "Lips of an Angel" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! 
This CD is awesome! I had only heard the "Lips of an Angel" on the radio and decided to buy it. Every song on it is great, no complaints. If you like Trapt, Nickelback, 3 Doors Down, Hoobastank, etc. then you will like this cd 
Extreme behaviour? I think not. Perhaps extremely bad lyrics. Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow? I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel? Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell 
I was in high school when Cheap Trick first popped on my personal radar screen. My friends and I had just a formed a band and religiously poured through Creem, Circus Guitar Player magazines. 2 of the guys in the band were always buying new albums by new groups and they had discovered Cheap Trick when the first album came out. They introduced me to the band when the "new" album "In Color" came out and I ran out and snatched up the 1st 2 albums and wore them out before Heaven Tonight was released. I've been a Cheap Trick fan ever since. On to the album and music - This re-master is a great improvement over the previous CD release but still suffers a bit from the album's original thin sound. Unfortunate, as I'd really like to get more of the 12 string bass punch from Gonna Raise Hell and Need Your Love. Still, this is a welcome improvement in audio quality. Things pop out of the mix when playing in a room that I generally have only noticed when I've got cans on my head. As for the songs - we all have our personal takes - and opinions are like - well, you know. Dream Police - It's a good tune, certainly not one of their best. A little too bubblegum on the chorus and I've always been put off by the strings. Would've sounded great had the string parts been Rick's overdubbed guitars. The Way Of The World - Love it. Cheap Trick in near perfect POP mode. The House Is Rockin' with Domestic Problems - one of my all time favorites from Cheap Trick. Built around a cool guitar phrase that's longer than the usual "hook" the song drives and builds right through to the fade out. Rick unleashes 3 great guitar solos in the course of this one song and even gets a trademark Beatles "quote" tossed in to the middle of one solo. And of course major nod to the Beatles 'She's So Heavy' on the bridge vocals. Gonna Raise Hell - love hearing the bass exposed in the intro - my only qualm with this song has always been (like Dream Police) the inclusion of the strings. I'll Be With You Tonight - not great, not bad. catchy little in-offensive tune.  Voices - yep. Pretty much a classic. Can't understand why this wasn't a Top 10 hit. Was it even released as a single? Writing On The Wall - Cheap Trick reflecting on their sudden fame and fortune (they went from long touring road dog nobodies - to road dog international stars in about a 6 month span of time time). Replete with sound effects of jets, cheering crowds, and screeching tires - the song is an attempt to capture the madness they were going through. Robin's "rap" at the end about their sudden fame is brilliant. I Know What I Want - Tom gets a shot at singing. For a song made up of maybe 4 chords it's pretty catchy. His nasally vocals take a bit of getting used to. Nothing special but it's still a fan favorite in concert because Tom gets to sing. Need Your Love - What can I say? This is what Cheap Trick music is all about. This song has everything - cool guitar riffs, Bun E.s steady groove, Robin's ethereal vocals - then changing to one of his more menacing tones, crunchy 12 string bass up the wazoo and Rick layering guitars upon guitars in the solo sections. Yet the song is so simple it's spooky - it is a near perfect example of the many elements that create the Cheap Trick sound. In concert this song is an unrelenting machine that builds and builds - the boys improvise within certain confines - yet the song remains structured. There's a handful of songs like this that sum up Cheap Trick, songs that I play for people when I want to let someone know that Cheap Trick is NOT that pop band that sings "I Want You To Want Me" and "The Flame". Great album closer, more restrained than live versions of the song. As for the Bonus stuff - it's not bad. I have several Cheap Trick concerts on CD - the live stuff here sounds better than some - not as good as others. This album has plenty of good ol fashioned, catchy mid-West American rock n roll. The way it was meant to be sang and played. Buy it 
The surprise success of "At Budokan" bumped this album, which was already complete, to the back burner while the hits ran their course. Likely because of a budding backlash from the post Budokan overexposure and increased expectations, "Dream Police" took an unjust drubbing at the time. But it was really the sound of the band evolving. The almost disco thump of "Gonna Raise Hell" and the nightmare vision of the title track proved Cheap Trick still had the brains, "Way Of The World" and "Need Your Love" provided the brawn. It was just that the band had become so competent that some of the edgy charm had slipped away. "Voices" was the kind of ballad that Cheap Trick might not have been able to pull off prior to this, and there were a few who viewed this kind of open balladeering as selling out. They missed the point. Cheap Trick was exploring their range on "Dream Police." Be that in Robin Zander's polished vocal on "Voices" or in that Tom Petersen took to the mike for the stunning "I Know What I Want," "Dream Police" became a showcase for the boys from Rockford IL. If you compare the Tricksters' sound here to new wave acts like Blondie and the Cars that were now in the same arena (Blondie's "Eat To The Beat" arrived roughly the same time as "Dream Police" and covers a lot of the same ground), you'll see how "Dream Police" remains an excellent album from a band in their prime. For the bonus tracks, I actually like the live material, particularly Tom's live stand on "I Know What I Want." The "no strings" version of the title cut is a misnomer, essentially it's just a demo. Regardless, "Dream Police" is a great record, and I am glad to have the brighter and better remaster 
No matter what another reviewer may have written, if you like this album, this is the one to own. Before calling someone a hack (the remasterer,) you need to have your speakers examined! (and yes, I have the Japanese version. 
Compared with the original CD mastering, this reissue of "Dream Police" is a welcome sound for sore ears. Unlike the previous reviewer, I do not own any of the Japanese editions (The Japanese do seem better at mastering CDs. Why is that?), but I can definitely hear the improved clarity and impact of this remaster. My quibble is with the bonus tracks. The sound quality on the live tracks is, to put it bluntly, unfortunate while the demo version of "Dream Police" offers nothing new. 
Jon Hendricks is "The James Joyce of Jive", and nowhere is that label better proven than here. This album is tremendous. The highlights are "Freddie Freeloader", where Hendricks does the Miles Davis' classic from "Kind of Blue" with solos for Al Jarreau, George Benson and himself to sing, copying note-for-note the solos of Miles, Trane and Cannonball; and the set-ender, another note-for-note vocalese recreation of the Benny Goodman version of Louis Prima's "Sing Sing Sing." Hendricks throughout his career has been the preeminent interpreter of Count Basie via original vocalese, and he starts this set with another--a marvelous note-for-note re-creation of "Jumpin' at the Woodside." Hendricks was in his 70's when this album was recorded and released; senior citizens should take note and have hope 
A wonderful CD, well worth buying for the vocal arrangements of Miles' Freddie Freeloader and Monk's Rhythm a ning alone. Many of the tracks are very recognizable classics as instrumentals, finely (and finally) remade by Hendricks to lyrics and voice. The one star off is not for Hendricks, but for the sometimes squeeky vocals of Manhattan Transfer singing nearly too high for comfort 
In covering these classic tunes, complete with famous solo's from other artist's renditions like Miles Davis's version of Freddie Freeloader, Hendricks and company completely dominant these tunes with style, finese, and virtuosity. This is a must have for any serious jazz fan and will not dissapoint, trust me! It will go down in musicology classes as required listening and studying long after Mr. Hendricks leaves us for God's vocalestra...Jon, you are the man and will always be the man 
... I believe the inventor of Vocalese was actually King Pleasure. In any case, I was wholly impressed with Freddie Freeloader...especially the title track. True Jazz Vocalists are a scarce commodity and Jon Hendricks' old but agile vocal cords exemplify the art of vocalese and vocal jazz improvisation. Bobby McFerrin's ethereal falsetto floats with startling presicion over Adderley's piano licks. Enjoyable for beginning jazz fans and purists alike - Swingin 
The time was the late 70's when hog wash Disco was around and everybody was getting influenced by the bad aspects of it. Cheap Trick came around to save the decade from decadence. This proves that a new feel and wave was done right. While people like Sex Pistols and The Clash were ridiculing the grandioseness of rock. Cheap Trick was bringing it back the flavor that it had lost. This album is about rock and roll to the grind. It's about people who were hungry to be different but in a good way. They disguised themselves as outcasts who didn't even fit together in a band , yet are some of the most versatile musicians around even today(2005). This album can always be played and it takes me back to a time when "Ah who gives a F*() !" Roll up my sleeves and play air guitar to one of rock's most underated axeman. And to the god on vocals ,Zander. Play it again it's magic dudes 
You should see Cheap Trick in concert, awesome band. This release is what we originally had prior to the whole Budokan concert being released later. I don't have the whole concert cd but I would recommend it based upon what I have heard. This release has most of the high points and more popular songs from the concert. "Ain't That Ashame" with the intro is worth the price alone as this has become an opening song during some Cheap Trick shows. Energy is high from start to finish, highly recommended for any rock fan 
Catchy yet 100% rock 'n' roll. One of my personal favorite albums which I own on vynil. I know this is the majority opinion, but I've got to say that "Surrendor" is the best song on the album, and one of the best songs ever. Cheap Trick's live recordings always sounded much, much, much better than their studio recordings. One of the best albums to dance to 
Truly one of the great live albums of all time. The advice of the other reviewers is dead on: Buy either the two CD Complete Budokan or this along with Budokan II (if you can find it) You will not be sorry. This masterpiece belongs right up there with The Who's Live At Leeds and The Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya YA's Out. 
Cheap Trick were major stars in Japan when they recorded this album at the Budokan. You can tell they inspired Beatlesque hysteria as evidenced by the screaming of the fans on the album. They add an energy to the album and the band responds to it by firing out a set of pure power pop. "Hello There", "Come On, Come On", "Need Your Love", "Goodnight" &amp; "Clock Strikes Ten" all bristle with catchy chorus and power guitar riffs, while the top ten hit "I Want You To Want Me" slinks along with lecherous glee. The true star of the album is "Surrender". The song leaps out of your speakers with Robin Zander's forceful vocals, Rik Nielsen's meaty guitar licks, Bun E. Carlos' steady drumming and Tom Petersen's harmony vocals and pumping bass. It is as close to a pure pop song as you can get and the triumph of their careers. The album went platinum and into the top ten and secured Cheap Trick a place in many fellow musicians hall of fam 
When this record came out, pop music and rock and roll needed it. Gems like "Come On Come On" "Need Your Love" "Ain't That A Shame" "I Want You To Want Me" "Surrender" and "Clocks Strikes Ten" just jumped out of your speakers. The fans treated these guys like they were the Beatles. That they are not. But, Rick Nielsen can write a catchy tune and Robin Zander has a good voice. This album broke them in America and it deserves to be considered one of their classics 
My baby listens to music during bathtime, so I want to introduce her to an array of different music styles. I bought this as her introduction to jazz music, and we really enjoy it. The jazz beat is like ear candy, but the songs and lyrics are cute and fun for the little ones! We also really like "Potato Chips." I also like to buy childrens music with some longevity (Cheer up, your kids will eventually get tired of Raffi, no offense!) and this is an album that everyone can enjoy at any age. It's timeless and classy! A great buy for ~ $9. : 
I am not a jazz fan, but I absolutely love this CD! My husband loves jazz, so bought this for our 17-month-old daughter. She will listen to the CD at least 3 times a day. It starts with a rousing rendition of "Old McDonald" by Ella Fitzgerald, a truly great singer. I love "Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens". My daughter also loves the potato chip song and the chicken rhythm song. The CD ends with the Louis Armstrong classic, "What a Wonderful World". If you're looking for a fun CD for kids, this is one every kid should have in his or her collection 
This CD keeps my 10 month-old daughter fully entertained while I take a shower. It's not "jazz" like you might be thinking (abstract, hard to sing to), these are catchy tunes that you have heard many times before. There may be a few you don't know like the great song about potato chips. It's just too cute. I also like the muffin man...it's a classic 
We absolutely love the Jazz for Kids CD and we buy it as a gift for all the kiddie birthday parties. My husband and I love it just as much as my two year old and her baby brother. Favorites include Ella Fitzgerald's jazzy "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", "Yes, We Have No Bananas", which my daughter sings all the time with or without the CD, "Rag Mop," and "The Muffin Man". I agree with the previous reviewer that the only thing I'd like better about it is if it were longer! I played it at a baby shower I hosted and it was a hit with all the guests. A great introduction to jazz for kids. 
My husband thinks I'm crazy because I'm always singing the songs on this cd to my son. But, the music is so infectious you can't help it! Jake loves the music too. His little legs go crazy in the car seat when he hears them. He kicks away to the upbeat tunes. Great intro to jazz. Ella really knows how to get the barnyard hoppin' 
This music so so wonderful. It is very high energy and fun. The kids don't really care that this a "jazz" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy. Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as "kids" music, get them something you can both enjoy. Our favorites are the "Doodle" song and "Potato Chips." Worth every penny and then some 
great gift to give, well priced, terrific tracks. well, except for the quack quack lyrics of one song, but my 4 yr old does like that one... muffin man, potato chips and wonderful world are real standouts! a joy to listen to with my kids and find us all singing long after the cd has been turned off.. 
This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard. The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to. It's a great intro to jazz 
WE LOVE THIS CD. IT'S BY FAR OUR FAVORITE KIDS MUSIC CD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
This is a great CD for kids and adults. I catch myself singing these songs all day at work. Our favorites are "Yes, We have no Bannas" and "Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens". Some great songs and great artists 
I am lucky enough to have been acquainted with Johnny A and his mesmerizing talent for decades...it is so satisfying to see him finally getting the recognition he deserves. Buy this CD and his first release Sometime Tuesday Morning and you will understand what all the hoopla is about. This guy can play, and he will take you places you never thought a guitar could go...he is a legend in the making! Don't ever pass up a chance to catch him live...he will make a believer out of you 
This is a most enjoyable set of instrumentals, and the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I heard the man live, playing a killer set, before I bought this CD. In an intimate club setting, Johnny A burns the house down, and plays with a raw intensity that this studio recording does not quite catch. It's an excellent record nonetheless,full of masterly yet understated guitar playing, and solid songwriting.The soloing is concise and every note counts. If you really want to spoil yourself, see the man live with his trio...very awesome, and not just for guitar geeks 
You'll cruise by quaint country scenes, race a train skirting rolling hills and rustic mountains. You'll make it all the way to Nashville via gritty city streets past all the coolest jazz and rock clubs. That's where you'll go when you put "Get Inside", a slick offering from Johnny A, in your CD player. As it states on his biography page on his official website "This is music for an open mind aching for the open road." What was that, did Mark Knopfler cameo on this CD? No, but there is an unmistakable, however subtle, Knopflerish quality to Johnny A's playing on some tracks. Still, Johnny A's playing is completely his own, incredibly versatile, refreshing and new, with plenty of smooth grooves and tricks to keep your ears busy. Johnny A. is one of the most talented guitarists I've ever heard. Get Inside is a well produced collection of instrumental guitar tracks that conjure a variety of mental images. One thing that cannot be ignored about his playing is the incredibly clean picking and colorful phrasing. As a guitarist, there are moments in this CD that make me say, "How the heck did he do that?" Excuse me while I go lock myself away with my guitar for another twenty years. Good, inspiring guitar playing for the inspirable guitar lover 
Johnny A. style guitar is unique in that it rocks and sways and sings and crys and it does it all without being self indulgent. He makes every note count. No heavy metal shreading or sleepy smooth jazz or silly electonic effects. Just great vaccum tube driven guitar pure Johnny A. style. This is an extension of his previous CD which is very cool. His music has an edge on it which can't be put into words. If you love good guitar work you'll love this one. 
This is not Steve Vai widdling,but is guitar music anyone could listen to,Gibson make a guitar with his name on it!Nuff said 
I went to see Robert Cray live, and Johnny A's trio was opening for him. I've never heard about Johnny before that night, but I walked away from that performance totally in love with his music and his guitar playing approach. After a week, this performance was still a stand-out in my mind, and I decided to buy "Get Inside". The music on this CD is certainly played in a more controlled fashion than it was live (he's an excellent live performer), but it is played with style, class, mastery, and creativity of only the select few. Until I saw Johnny live and then heard his CDs, I had no idea you could make one single guitar sing such a wide variety of sounds and tones. His command of the instrument seems effortless, and he takes the pleasure tour through many musical styles, from blues to jazz to rock-n-roll to country influences. Johnny is one of the very few musicians whose guitar is good enough in a stand-alone trio, without a need for vocals or other coloring from other backing instruments. If you like guitar music that is classy, original, and very cleanly and creatively executed, get this disc, along with Johnny's earlier "Sometime Tuesday Morning" CD which is just as great as this CD. I am definitely Johnny's fan, and I cannot wait to listen to his future releases and to see him live again 
Johnny is as great as been said in all the other messages. But, I was dissapointed that he added more accompanyment than his previous CD. I mean, I really don't care to hear horn tracks or synthesized keyboard tracks as noted in the first song. He should stand alone and does not need any filler. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with either of his albums. But still, I like the first one better. 
Jazzier than his last one, but it sounds great. It bounces along nicely with a well-placed bent note here and there to keep your attention. Wonderful background music. If you like Ronnie Earl's recent stuff, you should like this as well. The guitar playing is just as crisp. I saw him live once when he opened for B.B. King, and he put on a great show, even though he sat on a stool the whole time 
I had no idea what to expect, other than some competent guitar work, when I walked into the Rosewood Theatre, Morgantown, WV (Go Mountaineers) in April, 05 to hear Johnny A. Apparently, few knew something big was up, as my buddy and I took the table in front, nothing but six feet of air between us and the wooden stool on stage. Three hours later I left that room in a daze, my musical universe spinning crazily. My taste in guitar music has generally gone to electric blues, eg. SRV, Allman Bros, C. Montoya, KWS, etc. What the hell did I just see/hear? I'm a blues guy and sometimes it was bluesy, but I'm not a jazz guy (am I?) but sometimes it was jazzy and, OK, yeah, well that sounds like Chet Atkins, and there's a little Mark Knopfler, oh wait, THERE'S Stevie, floating right next to Jimi and on and on. I don't know how else to describe it, I don't know anything about guitar other than what I like, Johnny wasn't exactly copying anyone else, his music with his influences and experiences just seem to flow from him. His guitar is truly his voice. He did most or all of Get Inside and some of STM. Please, please buy this CD, do it for your soul. Listen to it many times, you will hear more each time and somehow it becomes more powerful with each listening. I am absolutely hooked on this guy, he's a treasure. I've often chided myself for never seeing SRV. I feel better now. 
I bought Get Inside in May 2004, and was totally mesmerised by this totally stunning guitarist! Every tune on the cd is wonderful! From the remakes of Johnny Rivers "Poor Side of Town" and the Jimi Hendrix tune "The Wind Crys Mary", to the JA originals like "Sing Singing" and "I Had to Laugh", this guy and this cd are so great! I saw him on June 6th, 2004 at Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Dallas TX. and the guy and his band were fabulous!!! Nuff said!!! :- 
What can anyone say about this album that hasn't already been said. It's CT's best. I can't offer any further insight to the greatness of this album that hasn't been said a thousand times before. The original is brilliant from start to finish. Having said that though, it perhaps is a bit poppy. Doesn't have the rock of their other albums from that era, but it's a nice change. The bonus songs here are nice additions. Southern Girls is ranks in their best top 3 songs. The weakest track for me has always been Clock Strikes Ten - it only scores 4/5!! Even on Budokan it's always been a lesser track for me. I can't wait to hear the re-recorded version the boys did recently. It's sure to have the rock element this sometimes lacks. Hopefully they release it soon. As mentioned, ranks up the very top of their albums. Next Position Please follows 
Juxtapose this with dreck that was around in 70's (REO/STYX/Boston), 'In Color' is a pure power pop masterpiece. It avoids the lunk-headed 'hard rock' cliches of the 70's. "Come On, Come On" is one of their best tunes 
If you are reading this you are probably over 40 and heard some of Cheap Trick's stuff in your carousing youthful prime heyday. The disc is a great combo of power pop and AOR metal. I re-bought it after hearing "Big Eyes" on Sirius Sat. radio's "The Vault" channel. (Had the vinyl way back when) I loved the insturmental track, (and the other bonus tracks are cool also.) My faves: "so good to see you", "clock strikes ten", and of course ..."hello there" Another major selling point to me as a kid at the department store was the back side of the cover. On the front you have Robin Tom, all pretty boys with the "rock star life" pose etc., but what sold me was the back cover (for those who have not seen it) called "and in black white" with a B pic of Rick and Bun on mo-peds (I think they are mo-peds!) that picture is the one that made this teenaged pimple hormone nerd IDENTIFY with these guys. And a fan from then on! 
It's hard to say anything bad about this album, but I guess if pressed I'd lodge a complaint against the wimpy sound of I Want You To Want Me. (That point is rendered quite moot by the killer version that later showed up on the Budokan album.) As Cheap Trick albums go, you can't go wrong with any of the first three albums. Cheap Trick is a crunchy, rock encrusted debut, Heaven Tonight is one of the all time must-have albums of power pop, and In Color buoys the pop end of the CT spectrum nicely. As with all of the CT remasters, the added tracks serve to both lengthen the albums, but also help to flesh things out from a historical standpoint. Big Eyes, Southern Girls, and Come On, Come On are the standout tracks on this effort, but trust me. This one plays through nicely start to finish 
The band's second album is a very good one. It's good to play loud when driving or at the computer (like right now...) The songs itself are great. "Big Eyes," "Downed," "You're All Talk," and "Clock Strikes Ten" show that the band didn't lose their edge despite an almost-too-clean production. Indeed, the liner notes state that "the band has since grumbled about the pristine production." The weakest song on here is "Come On Come On," which was done better on 'Live At Budokan' and as a bonus track demo. I also have to be in the right mood to hear "Oh Caroline." Some people complain about "I Want You To Want Me" on this album and how different it is from the big live hit version. All I can say is that it's different, but in a good way. The honky-tonk piano part makes it sound like it came straight from Vaudeville. As for love ballads, they're kinda nonexistent this time around, which is a shame. The album clocks in at just around 30 minutes, so there's no real bad song on the album. Did I mention "Southern Girls" and "So Good To See You" are excellent songs? The bonus tracks are neat too: "Oh Boy" is a good song, but I personally think that a vocalized version could have been included. The demos ("Southern Girls" and "Come On Come On") show how the album would have sounded sans the super-clean production job. (Tom Werman mustn't have been to bad-he went on to do the next two albums!) The live version of "You're All Talk" is a bit of a throwaway, and the live version on 'Sex America Cheap Trick' is a lot better. That song was meant to go fast. And the live version of "Goodnight Now" is better than the one on 'Budokan.' It's a great album, just be sure to get it before you get 'Heaven Tonight' or 'Dream Police' or their debut. This album really can't compete with those three. All in all though it's just fun harmless rock, and that's all that really matters, right 
The Love Experience is amazing. I heard "Guess who loves you more" and lost my mind. I waited on the release of the CD and bought it on spot. From the first track until the end, the Cd is amazing and is one of the best CD's I have heard in the last 4 years. He's here to stay and this Cd says that 
this is a must have album. it is for any day of the year. Raheem Devaughn is definitely a talented artist. 
The CD was an amazing experience and I look forward to hearing more great works from this wonderfully talented artist. The CD is a breath of fresh air amidst all of the Romper Room type music going on in the music industry as of late 
Admittedly, I might be a little biased as Raheem DeVaughn is from DC as am I, but this album is the best! This is the kind of album you can listen to all day long at work, at home, in the car, and never tire of hearing it. It sets the mood: it's insightful, it's romantic, it's jammin - It is Perfection! 
First off Raheem has a amazing voice. I saw him in concert last night and I feel in love with his voice. He is such a great performer. His music touches the soul. I love this cd I am always listening to it. I cant go anywhere with out it. He is going to be around for a long time. 
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO RAHEEM DEVAUGHN FOR MAKING SUCH A DIFFERNET AND WONDERFUL ALBUM. "THE LOVE EXPERINCE" IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST SOULFUL ALBUMS. AND IF YOU EVERY GET A CHANCE TO WITNESS THIS BROTHER LIVE, GO SEE HIM! THE LIVE SHOW IS ALL THAT 
Love Raheem DeVaughn's Love Experience. It's a great CD to listen to when you just want to chill. Although I find myself listening to my favorites over and over again. All and all it is really a good CD and worth buying 
Raheem has such an exquisitely gentle and sweet voice. This album it's all about LOVE and the positive aspect of it at that. I wish there were more artists that would focus on what's positive about life. I am on cloud 9 and I don't wanna come down from it! Every track is my favorite. 
This is probably one of the few albums that I listen to from beginning to end. It is definately one of the best albums of 2006. The album sort of reminds me of the first D'Angelo album 
There isn't a whole lot that I can add to the other reviews. This album is definitely one of the best albums (rap or otherwise) to come out of the 90's. I could go into specific songs and talk about how funky they were, but if you were around to experience their sound when they dropped in '90 (or have bothered to read the other reviews) then you know how dope they are. Grand Verbalizer, Funkin' Lesson, Shaft's Big Score, Tribal Jam.....I mean, the list just goes on and on. As far as imperfections, there are none on this album. It may sound a little dated, but in my eyes, that's a good thing. I mean, really, when is the last time you were in a club and heard a funky jam that also tried to uplift who you were? My only beef is that the album is only 11 tracks deep and just under 48 minutes long. Anyone that knows hip hop acknowledges the X-Clan as one of the dopest acts to come out of the 1990's. It you haven't heard To The East Blackwards, then go pick it up and quit sleeping As many of you already know, Professor X died from complications from Meningitis this past March [3-17-06]. I wonder if X-Clan will still drop the material recorded during their comeback attempt this year (the Return From Mecca LP). I'd love to hear what they would sound like in 2006. Though Sugar Shaft (who died from complications from AIDS in '95) wasn't as vocal in the group, it's all but impossible to imagine what they'd sound like without Professor X The Overseer. R.I.P. PXO [Aug. 4, 1956 ~ Mar. 17, 2006]. Standout Tracks: Verbs Of Power, Tribal Jam, Raise The Flag, Earth Bound, Heed The Word Of The Brother, Funkin' Lesson, Verbal Milk, Shaft's Big Score (My Favorite), Grand Verbalizer What time Is It?, and In The Ways Of The Scale 
This album bites like an alligata! Me and my bro listened to it back in the day non-stop. It was great then and even better now! Like rap? Get it! SISSYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! Peac 
This was crazy!! If you come from NYC you know about this big time. VJ Ralph Mcdaniels on a show called VIDEO MUSIC BOX use to have these brothers on all the time. Brother j was killin it! RIP sugar shaft. Yo, this is a must 
Classic material, if only they had made a 2nd classic. Brother J had a good flow 
I had this album when it came out I was a junior in high school and this album literally sounds better than 90 percent of the music out now. Krs-0ne and x-clan had sort of an intellectual beef when this album dropped they went back and forth on some philosophy type rebuttal records (SEE "Sex and violence" by KRS) that was crazy. Anyway album is a great buy if you want to know where hip hop was 15 years ago. Buy the way this has been protected.....you know the rest. PEAC 
This album is a must for anyone who wants a great rap CD in their music collection. You can't X-Clan on any online music store like iTunes or Sony or MSN. When I first bought this on cassette when I was in high school/college, when it originally came out. I was probably the only white guy in my City listening to X-Clan. I just found out that I lost my orignal cassett copy I bought back in the day. I just purchased it on CD without hesitation. This is album is THE JAM 
When I was 17, this was it for me and my boy james, we lived X-CLAN. I still have this on tape and cd as well as XODUS. In the words of Brother J and Professor X, " This is protected by the Red, the Black, and the Green, on the road again, SISSY" ! GO COP Brother J solo, Professor X solo Queen Mother Rage solo and Isis solo releases, SISSY 
X-Clan's To the East CD is classic old-school pro-black hip hop. It's also one of my old favorite CD's from my hip-hop-only teenager days. The group was pro-black and very militant in their look and attitude. The militant part doesn't really flow into the songs so much as the pro-Africanism does. Brother J is a great frontman; a great mc with a great delivery. Professor X was the group's version of a more-educated more-pro-black Flava Flav. X-Clan was never too popular even in their best days, but it was still good stuff. A personal favorite of mine...this one is better than Xodus, which is still good too 
Wow. I was on my way to lunch with a co-worker when she popped this CD in. It was familiar sounding to me. I vaguely remember seeing X-Clan's video on The Box back in the day so I was intrigued. I dubbed a copy of my own and have been playing it like it was produced last month. I thought after listening more closely to my own copy the music would sound dated...it doesn't. It's intelligent and I find it refreshing to hear some hip-hop, rap lyrics that are talking about booties, ho's and bling-bling with the latest R singer doing the hook - so played out and the reason why the whole genre has turned me off lately. One must take the lyrics with a grain of salt. X-Clan is definately in touch with their "Blackness" to the point of being militant. But their focus is on everyone, including persons of color who have a "gansta" mentality. Now I'm off to support the group and buy a real copy 
Brother J is definitely a gifted MC and X-Clan owns a piece of hip-hop history, but can you say RACIST? "Silly and Magilla. Chocolate and vanilla. How could polar Bears swing on vines of the gorillas. please" Imagine if a white artist said something like that about blacks 
The cd I received was scratched. I sent it back with the return form but never received my refund 
There have been dozens of "love songs" collections released. I have several of these and plan to buy more. These collections are usually all or nearly all songs that have been previously released, which means that some fans may be thinking "What! ANOTHER collection?" However, I enjoy these collections because I enjoy the love songs of these artists and hearing them together is often fun. This collection contains 18 songs released in the 34 years from 1967 to 2001. Many of these songs are often played on easy listening and classic rock stations. Ten of the 18 songs were released as singles, but several of the songs that were not singles occasionally get airplay. Several of the singles went to #1. "Lonely Days," "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart," "How Deep Is Your Love," and "Too Much Heaven" were all Bee Gees chart toppers. "Islands in the Stream" was a #1 hit for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. The version on this collection was sung live by the Bee Gees. Even those songs that were not chart toppers will hold you in their embrace. "Emotion" contains as much emotional power as any Bee Gees' song. "Heartbreaker" is another winner, from the 2001 album "The Record." "Closer than Close" is a mellow love song from the 1997 album "Still Waters" that is captivating. "I Could not Love You More," also from "Still Waters," has wonderful harmonies that were always the trade mark of the Brothers Gibb. The Bee Gees became the joke of a generation when disco music fell from favor. However, the Bee Gees were masters of their art, and their music is beautiful. The Bee Gees were especially good at singing love songs, as this collection shows. If you seek another "Love Songs" collection, this one is excellent. If you would like to have a collection of Bee Gees love songs, this one is first rate. As a casual fan of the Bee Gees, I am very impressed by this collection and recommend it for fans of the Bee Gees and lovers everywhere. Enjoy! 
This collection is wonderful! It is classic Bee Gees, doing what they do best. I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He loved it! 
Just what I was looking for. Perfect Valentines Day gif 
I grew up listening to music by the Bee Gees and it is great to have all the best songs together in this one disk. It makes me want to get out the platform shoes, bell bottoms and disco ball 
Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record. It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them. Any real fan can make a better list 
I have to wonder why Robin felt the need to release this album. It is a collection of Bee Gees songs but Barry was not consulted about the album or selections of songs. Is Robin in need of money that he continues to throw the same songs out to fans? How many copies of these hits do we really need to own? I don't understand why some songs would even be considered 'love' songs and why solo releases if it is called a Bee Gees album? I thought the cover was strange that it didn't contain a picture of the Bee Gees, maybe because Robin failed yet again to consult his brother, but wants fans to believe it was a joint effort. Sorry Robin, but fans know it wasn't. If Barry had been involved, he would have mentioned it on his web site plus offered the album for fans to buy. The lack of show on Barry's site shows fans once again you have tried to mislead people and just fatten your wallet. I hope for all Bee Gees fans that Robin gets over his anger at his big brother and realizes that he just isn't capable of doing it on his own. As for this album, why waste your money! Get out a blank CD and make your own album, I guarantee you will come up with a better song selection and look at all the money you have saved. 
For example, why is Closer Than Close on here? Don't know, don't care. They did an excellent job of picking some great love songs over the Bee gees career. Love So Right would have been a perfect addition to this album because it's one of their greatest singles and talks about love's goods and bads. It's good to see songs like Emotion, Heartbreaker, and Islands In The Stream on this collection. All songs are digitally remastered and have excellent sound quality. Interesting collaboration of songs. So check it out 
the Bee Gees have always been a favorite Music act of mine.they have Composed some of the best Songs over the past 25-35 years.there vocals,arragements have Produced some timeless songs. this is a good introduction to there Music impact it has had on many ears throughout the World 
Eighteen songs representing the best love songs the Bee Gees have written over five decades (which is incredibly debatable considering how many they have written). The actual list is tremendous and these chosen gems truly represent the variations the Gibbs have produced over the years. Included in the UK version is the song, "Lovers And Friends" with Ronan Keating singing lead on the last Bee Gees love song written as well as the album cut, "Heart Like Mine". It is a completely Remastered collection appealing only to those romantically inclined. 
I found my first exposure to the music of American minimalist composer Terry Riley (and minimalism as a genre), to be extremely rewarding. As a fan of 1970s progressive rock and electronica, I am a little surprised that I did not explore the genre sooner, given that there is so much overlap between audiences of progressive and minimalism...well, at least there was overlap back when both styles formed part of a "popular avant-garde". At any rate, this 1969 album is excellent and sounds (to my ears) as exciting and innovative now as I am certain it did upon its release. Terry Riley plays quite an assortment of instruments on this album including electric organ, RMI electric harpsichord, rocksichord, dumbec (finger drum), and tambourine. The electric organ however, which is heavily treated at times, dominates the soundscape. There is also heavily electronically altered soprano saxophone in the mix too. Quite honestly, this is some of the strangest and most eerie saxophone playing I have ever heard - very long sustained tones, with only incremental changes. The music on this album is characterized by a series of what musicologists refer to as "ostinato networks". These networks are comprised of layers of interlocking and repeated melodic patterns that gradually unfold over long periods of time (A Rainbow in Curved Air = 18'39"; Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band = 21'38") with only very subtle changes over the course of each piece. There is however, a subtle rhythmic element, which is nicely demonstrated on the first piece. Evidently, this is a tendency borrowed from American jazz styles. In large part however, the music on this album is deeply meditative, and at times borders on the hypnotic. The droning organ does a great job of achieving this and reflects a structural aspect borrowed from eastern music, particularly Indian classical music. One interesting fact that I read during my fact-finding session on minimalism was that the sheer length of each piece and the meditative quality of the music deliberately tried to reproduce the sense of timelessness induced during an acid trip. The second piece is a good example of this and seemed to at least partially suspend time - I got very caught up in the meditative aspects of the music and (for once) was not aware of time. This is fantastic stuff and I am well on my way to exploring other works by Terry Riley including his masterwork "In C", in addition to other minimalist composers such as Steve Reich, LaMonte Young, and Philip Glass. Very highly recommended to my fellow proggers 
Ok, this LP must have been on Pete Townshend's turntable day and night. Listen to the first track and you'll hear where "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" came from. In fact, the Riley in "Baba O'Riley" IS Terry Riley. - Vincent G. Marin 
While this may have been technically impressive at the time it was written (1968), it doesnt really stand the test of time; if I had heard it without knowing it was by Terry Riley, I would have thought I was listening to a fairly average modern electronica piece. There is minimalist work that has aged better than this; for example "Tago Mago" by Can, and some pieces by Philip Glass and Arvo Part. In the realm of early electronica, Jean Michel Jarre's "Oxygene" blows Riley's work away despite being only recorded 5 years later. The second piece (Poppy Nogood) is significantly more interesting than Rainbow imo, although both lack any real emotional depth 
When you say Terry Riley most people say "who?".Terry Riley made people think about the sythizier and tape loops,without him where would Baba O' Riley be,what about Eno,Soft Machine,even Pink Floyd and Funeral For a Friend by Elton. They sure wouldn't have have the synth in there or that melodelic sound.The title track Rainbows in Curved Air opens and finishes with this looped organ,synth track going around with some trickles of lead synth pouring down with some organ chords ont the side. Second part introduces tamborine professionally played and some backwards organ. That builds to where Riley introduces looped drums and insterments like harpsichord,piano and some keyboard that has this oriental pluck to it. This goes on on tell the piece suddenly stops. We then listen to the live Poppy Nogood and Phantom Band which is played with two to three tape machines playing at a different times to get a looped effect. bass drones start the song and end the song on this one With these wierd brass like insterments building and building kind of like In C.We hear Terry Riley on sax squealing away the the track gos to this brass loop with a drone callback responce.That fades to a heavy bass drone and Terry on sax which is loop for a echo effect with is pretty hyponotizing. The sax gets more intense by the minute and ends with the drone finishing afterward.A great album with a genuis working with anolog tapes with is pretty hard to do probably because your working with tape.Anyways this is an essiential to own. Recommendations would be any Soft Machine album Third on up or Hugh Hopper for thr Riley influence. 
sounds like bach and ravi shankar having breakfast together at the ihop the morning after a dove defecates on joyce meyer's head.booblibob booblibo 
That subject pretty much says it all. This pair of pieces sees Terry Riley during the initial period of his experiments with tape delays and electronic organs, where he began to create long, flowing improvisational tapestries of repeating periodic forms. If you're familiar with Indian music, particular Karnatic music, you'll find this especially fascinating, as there's a definite parentage from the Indian subcontinent to this style. The title work is a gentle, melodic, flowing piece which swirls around and around, sort of like some candy-colored psychedelic dervish dance. But the other piece, "Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band", is a dark and delicious work, with Riley adding his superb sax (very shenai-influenced, it should be noted) playing to the mix along with tense organ drones and shocking, abrupt shifts of tone. A great work to play for those who dismiss minimalism as bland repetitive background music! This is a truly important release, and also an excellent introduction to this important period in Terry Riley's output 
listen - i didn't hallucinate or anything. or unlike my predecessors have shower me people or Dan diagelo affairs in 1969. however i did corral this in with SISTER RAY and blast off on a curve of my own. i kept wanting lou reed to come over the entire time i listened. basically to speak without confusion: its not bad people. it is not classical music either. but its still good and fine and i would buy it just because it will make you jump and if you already have a pentium 3 buy it anyway 
It was winter, 1969, Great Barrington, Vt. I was visiting my girlfriend. I arrived the night before, from Connecticut, exhausted, jealous, foolish... in the morning, she left in the shadows for the shower. I sat of the edge of the bed and turned on her record player. It cycled and the arm dropped down on Rainbow in Curved Air. I opened the curtains with a yank and the sky was FULL of falling white snow. The music began. In two weeks our affair would be over, but the music of that moment will always be with me. Perhaps the most perfect moment of my life. Chris Browne EN 
This is not a "blow off" cd. It was compiled with care. The execution is stellar. The liner notes are written affectionatley. The music is top notch, true to the originals sonically. They also managed to infuse the lep spirit into the songs as well. For 10.00, it cant be beat! Its a good fun cd to put on for parties, etc. BUY IT! SUPPORT A BAND THAT STILL PAYS THEIR INSTRUMENTS 
This CD is one of the best by the Leps! You will not be disappointed! It's great hearing songs that the guys in Def Leppard grew up listening to and they "leppardized" the tunes! Awesome CD! A must have 
O.K., I'll be straight up with you right from the get go....never in a million years would I have ever expected to own a Def Leppard album! Oh, sure, I've picked up a single or five over the years, but a full album? Nope. No way. There was just SOMETHING about the band....! So imagine my surprise when a friend played YEAH! for me....and I loved it! Mind you, I still think covers albums are slowly taking over the world, and could eventually be the death of the classic singer/songwriter as we know them if allowed to go unchecked, but the fact of the matter is that YEAH! is a definite candidate for the year's most fun, flat-out good time, album. Simply put, it's a blast! Things kick off with T. Rex's "20th Century Boy." I've loved this song ever since Girlschool covered it in the mid-80's. However, listening to Def Leppard's version, you realize just what a masterpiece it really is. True, it's not as instantly catchy as "Bang A Gong", but with it's perfect blend of rock, pop and glam, it really was the musical grandfather of New Wave. A full 6 to 7 years before said movement - 1973! - the song's throbbing bassline, growling guitars and hypnotically playful vocals were coming together in a sultry, sexy blend. And, thirty-three years later, Def Leppard catches that same vibe, complete with the same wink, pout and pinch on the arse! Brilliant! David Essex's "Rock On" hasn't aged as well, but the band still manages to give it a nice, new sheen. Sort of edgy, sort of cryptic, the track works for the first two-thirds, then (sadly) turns into a generic, run-of-the-mill arena rocker. Far superior is the group's take on Blondie's "Hanging On The Telephone." It's very rare for anyone to take a song that is SO identified with both a band and a specific gender-based vocal, turn it upside down, and make it their own. However, that's exactly what Def Leppard does here....if you didn't know the Blondie version, you would swear this was a brand new song, written for today, all radio-hit ready. High octane and energetic, the cut rocks out, while still embracing it's pop roots. Another high point! Ditto their take on the Kink's "Waterloo Sunset." Unequivocally British, the track nevertheless retains the dreamy, universal quality of the original. Joe Elliott's lead vocal is wistful, yet powerful, while the arrangement both swoops and soars, muted one minute, powerful the next. Maybe it just takes another act doing his material to remind us, once and for all, that Ray Davies really is one of the most underrated, overlooked songwriters of the last half a century. Yet ANOTHER winner! Then there's Sweet's "Hell Raiser", the disc's only real klunker. When doing a cover, you want to A) Make it your own or B) Improve upon the original....unfortunately, this track does neither (in all fairness, the song does sound silly and dated!). I'd never heard E.L.O.'s "10538 Overture" (to be honest, at first I thought it was a Cheap Trick song I just didn't remember!), but I LOVE this cut! Def Leppard takes the string arrangements that E.L.O. was mainly known for in the beginning, mixes them with their own rock roots, and comes up with a hybrid that is vibrant, unique and captivating. The track literally soars out of the speakers! I also love what they've done with Roxy Music's "Street Life." Stripped of the art-house pretentiousness that dominated much of Roxy's early output, the band's turned the song into a straight ahead rocker. Part Bryan Adams, part early Huey Lewis, part classic bar band, this is just good, old rock roll, plain and simple! Speaking of Bryan Adams, Elliott's vocal on Bowie's "Drive-In Saturday" could easily be mistaken for the Canadian rocker. Don't get me wrong - the band makes the track their own, what with it's swaying sense of reminiscence and memory. It's just that, on a couple of notes, you would SWEAR....!!! But on to Free's "Little Bit Of Love." The band could have easily taken this one over the top, but instead they (brilliantly!) reign it in. With great guitars and an awesome lead vocal, the power's still there, but it never OVERpower's! Mott the Hoople's "The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll" boarders on campy, but it's still a fun song, and fits in perfectly on this collection. And then we have Badfinger's "No Matter What." A true classic that has totally stood the test of time, Def Leppard's version shows why....infectious hooks, clean, concise lyrics, a melody to die for!....this is pop music at it's best and most memorable, with the band pulling out all the stops to showcase that fact! One of YEAH!'s crowning achievements! I'd never heard of John Kongos and "He's Gonna Step On You Again", but I love this percussion-drenched number! With it's rhythmic groove, snarling guitars and looped vocals, the track is absolutely mesmerizing....just picture the musical love child of pretty much anything by T. Rex and KT Tunstall's "Black Horse the Cherry Tree" and you'll have a pretty good picture of this beaut! Things wrap up with pretty much standard - though enjoyable! - versions of Thin Lizzy's "Don't Believe A Word" and The Faces' "Stay With Me." So.....if you want a fun release, pick up YEAH!; not only does it celebrate a classic era in rock history, it does so with class, guts and exuberant joy (As with all reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star, not because the lyrics are included - they're not - but because the band has instead told us why each song was chosen. I'm also giving an additional half a star for the CD booklet artwork - the classic album cover reproductions are nothing short of genius!) 
but I can't help feeling a tad worried about these boys, being one of the last 80's hard rock bands left. Why, you might wonder. The answer is quite simple: there are a few "statements" that any recording artist should consider very carefully before actually making them, and these are, (in order, 1 being the most delicate): 5)a live album 4)an unplugged record 3)a greatest hits 2)a "covers" album 1)an album of re-recorded, remixed, updated hits. Such records, more often than not, become an artist's swan song (the examples are WAY too numerous to mention), since they are often the result of a contractual obligation, and many other times, they fortell the impending decline of a band that has little or nothing else to say. Considering that the last release from the Leppard boys WAS a greatest hits, I'd say we SHOULD be worried...I'm hoping I'm wrong, though, 'cause they are one of my fav bands...but to be honest with y'all, I've RARELY been proven wrong about things such as this...Anyway...Artistic worries aside, I think that the record is very good from a musical point of view: I knew the vast majority of these songs,as well as the artist that originally performed them beforehand (although I must admit that I'd never heard of John Kongos before...), and the end results are great! The album is great because, in my humble opinion, it succeeds in doing 3 critical things: 1)the new versions remain true to the spirit and emotion of the originals, which is THE most difficult thing to do when making a cover (how many HORRORS have we had to endure because of this very issue? too many to count...)2)the songs, while being covers, also show the inprint of the band's own personality 3)the trademark sound of the band is preserved, while at the same time it is updated, in other words, this doesn't sound like "Hysteria", but you can immediately tell that this is Def Leppard. Personally, I enjoy cover albums (The Spaghetti Incident, Acid Eaters, etc), and 13 years ago thanks to GN'R, I ended up discovering a myriad of great bands thanks to their own cover album: being a diehard, i took time to read ALL the liner notes, including their last message "do yourself a favor,go get the originals." The Leps don't actually say as much, but I think the message in implied in their own liner notes as well. Who knows? Maybe this will spark a new wave of interest in 70's rock? I think that would be great! But on to the music: this record IS NOT a glam cover record! (Just as GN'R record WAS NOT a punk cover album...) granted, Sweet, Bowie and T-Rex were definitely glam, but on the other hand, Thin Lizzy, Free, The Kinks and/or Badfinger WERE NOT glam. This is a tribute to their earliest influences, some of which happened to be glam. Most of the songs rock, and they are trully faithful renditions of the originals, with maybe a change here or there. My personal favorites are "Don't Believe a Word" (one of my fav Lizzy songs, and I couldn't be happier with the result), "Waterloo Sunset", "A little bit of Love", "20th Century Boy" (is he by any chance the boyfriend of the "21st Century Sha-la-la-la Girl"?) and "No matter what". A couple of songs can throw you off a little bit, especially if you're a hard rocker, such as John Kongos "He's gonna step on you again" and Bowie's "Drive-in Saturday". Now, don't get me wrong, they are great, but a little different from the rest of the album. But in the case of Bowie's tune, I feel it is a decidedly improvement over the original, which I never really liked, and I finally realized why: Bowie's delivery is flat and uninspired, the total opposite from Joe Elliott's. Again, don't get me wrong, I don't think it's likely to see Joe win any "best vocalist" accolades for his job here, but I believe he is a great singer and does a great work here. I only have two more observations: 1)why did they include YET AGAIN "No matter what", which was already On their Greatest Hits package, when they had additional songs to choose from, such as Space Oddity, Search and Destroy, etc??? 2)how come their version of "Hell Raiser" sounds a little stiff? This is very weird, especially since the Leps had done "Action" 13 years ago for "Retroactive", and their version was by far superior than the original; in this case, the song sounds good, but I guess I'll stick with the original. All in all, this is a great album, an although I'm not old enough to remember those days (as Sav says), I have been able to greatly enjoy the music from that era. Make yourself a favor and give this record a try, and while you're at it, check out the originals, too!!! 
I have always been a Def Leppard fan since 1979. Their music has always been great. Their CD Yeah is also great. It contains music that has been done by other artists but vamped up and done Leppard style. I think it adds a great twist to the originals and shows how good rock and roll still is. 
Review no.98.Total of fourteen tracks,'Yeah!' simply has to be ONE of the best all-cover CD's I've ever heard.I've just recently caught Leppard on their current summer co-headlining tour with Journey,as they superbly played two of the best cuts off this CD,T.Rex's "20th Century Boy" and David Essex's Rock On" (I've heard fans go nuts over hearing this tune,saying it's the best song to hit the airwaves in years). Other outstanding tracks here are Badfinger's "No Matter What", The Face's FM staple "Stay With Me",Free's "Little Bit Of Love" and ELO's "10538 Overture".A must-have.Highly recommended 
The old, 1980-era "Def Leppard" logo plastered all over this CD says it all: The boys have officially shed their metal roots and changed their spots once again. They lead off with a rousing rendition of T. Rex's "20th Century Boy," and for most of the album the fun, arena-ready vibe doesn't change. It's worth noting that Leppard produced "Yeah" themselves, with the help of co-producer Ronan McHugh. The band chose energetic songs that really fit its style of rock, which, admittedly, has changed greatly over the years. Blondie's "Hanging on the Telephone" is sort of Def Leppard's version of pop punk, and they pull the song off really well. Joe Elliott is mostly done with the screaming vocals he put to such great use in the 1980s, and his voice now has a rugged falsetto that is just as effective. Other highlights on "Yeah" include the aggressive yet almost reminiscent-sounding "Street Life" by Roxy Music, the debauchery-loving "Golden Age of Rock and Roll" by Mott the Hopple (a song tailor-made for Def Leppard), and the gritty "Stay With Me," which boasts the splendidly scratchy vocals of Phil Collen. Badfinger's "No Matter What" is quickly becoming a classic Leppard staple in concert, while the rhythm of "He's Gonna Step On You" by John Kongos is strangely reminiscent of Leppard's "Rocket" from the album "Hysteria," though with a much toned-down result. Overall, this is an arena-ready, feel-good album that brings out the best in Leppard's multiple talents. Rick Allen hasn't sounded this prolific on his drum kit in a long time -- there are drum rolls and fills splattered everywhere on "Yeah." Either the technology of Allen's kit is getting easier and more compatible for him, or the guy is just learning new tricks he hasn't displayed in a while. The bonus track "Winter Song" features beautiful lyrics and Rick Savage's lone acoustic guitar; the song would make a great "rest period" for the band in concert, though true Leppard fans just wanna get rocked for 99% of the show. As Elliott used to say during the "Hysteria" tour in the late-'80s, "It's great to be back!" 1. 
The once mighty Def Leppard have once again stooped to an even lower level with this release of cheeseball "cover" tunes. I don't know who to blame for this one, but most likely it is lead singer Joe Elliot. He's the one that seems to be the most content to follow the ebb and flow of the popular music culture. I've said it before if. If everyone is completely out of whack and rock bands are only able to play small venues because the interest is gone, then it is very much akin to saying "everyone's jumping off the bridge now, so I guess I'll join them". Meanwhile, you have classic metal bands like Iron Maiden and Dio who continue to raise the bar high for the genre and they play huge venues. Just look at the front cover of this CD, with the guys engaged in their ridiculous bubble gum pop poses. Mark my words, the thirteen year olds who bought this CD will not remember it in two years and the fans like myself are now close to turning their backs on the band. I am glad for the new Iron Maiden CD, though, because it is a good one 
I had never seen Def Leppard in concert until Spring, 2005, and they put on a great set, playing of course primarily their many hits. They mentioned at the time they were working on an all-covers album, and played several of those songs at the show. A good year later, here we are, and here is that all-covers album. "Yeah!" (14 tracks, 48 min.) brings us the songs that influenced the band in their formative years. In other words, a lot of early 70s songs, with the occasional late 60s track as well. While the songs are certainly not bad, there are 2 main issues I have: (1) the songs are almost all played too close to the original song, and (2) the song selection leans too heavily on very well-known songs, creating the problem cited in the previous item and also not giving enough surprises. So the album works best for me when I hear some of the songs that I am not that familar with, such as "Little Bit of Love" (originally by Free), "He's Gonna Step On You Again" (John Kongas), and "Don't Say a Word" (Thin Lizzy). Apart from the songs themselves, the liner notes from the guys are really fun, and you can just tell they had a great time making this album. In any event, this album is meant to simply be enjoyed and not to be over-analyzed, and when all is said and done, I enjoy listening to the album 
For their follow up to 2005's "Rock of Ages" complation, Def Leppard decided to release a covers album "Yeah" to pay tribute to their influences. To the bands credit they stay away from most of the artists that they chose to covers biggest hits, when they could have easily choose songs that where better known. I only knew around four of the songs before I heard "Yeah". I find "Yeah" to be what a good covers album should be. The band turns to on to their influences and makes many of the songs into their own. Highlights include: No Matter What, 20th Century Boy, Hanging on the Telephone, and Hellraiser. Phil Collen's vocal on Stay with Me is awesome, it sounded so much like Rod Stewart. "Yeah" is a good album old and new fans of Def Leppard. There's a little something for everyone on "Yeah" 
After recovering from the buzzsaw guitar wash of "Sweet Heart Dealer" we get nearly two years later this surprise of an album from these LA darlings. Yes, the spectre of MBV does loom over the guitar work but the sound is cleaner (though still raw in its urgency) thereby revealing the melodic flow. The oversll production reveals the bass to hold the center of songs so that thte guitars can wash over one another instead of coalescing into a dissonant buzz. They hum instead of roaring. And the songs? Still littered with moments of disappointment, bleak and stark relationships and hopelessness but swirling around an amalgam of sound that's part Cure, MBV, Jack Off Jill, Joy Division and Jesus and Mary Chain. Best moments are City Noise, Bummer (neat chorus and hook), Manorexic, Stapled to the Mattress and the title tune. This is music that will rip your soul from its blood soaked foundations and having you thank them for it. 
First off, it IS different from Jack Off Jill... don't purchase this CD expecting it to be a duplicate of Jack Off Jill. This CD shows growth in both voice and music depth. The tracks can go from bouncy and bubbly to solemn and somber, but flow smoothly and creates balance. I can't say I love one band over the other because they are two completely different sounds. All I can say is that I LOVE So Long, Scarecrow and that I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind change. 
This proves that Scarling is an original and creative band, far surpassing Jack Off Jill. All JOJ fans can be sure, that Scarling is no JOJ reborn, but is it's own band, inovative and brain-tickling. What a refreshing break from the norm! ~Mirlin Popla 
I am so glad I discovered this band. I love this CD and never get sick of it!!! I'm only depressed that I don't have Sweet Heart Dealer. 
I expected great things from Scarling!! the first Album was so good i couldnt wait for the next!!! I was not let down!! it was great, i listen to it all the time!!! this album wont leave my CD player for a long time!!! its simply beautiful! 
So Long Scarecrow by Scarling is amazing! Since purchasing the album several months ago, it still remains the one album I have listened to everyday. Yes it really is that good. I can't even pick out a favourite song for you because they all rock! The angry guitar sound works perfectly in contrast with the sweet sounding vocals of the lead singer Jessicka. A truly splendid album. Buy it... Now 
So long, scarecrow is a departure from the music of jack off jill; The previous album, sweet heart dealer, while breaking away from that sound never the less had elements of Jessika's previous band. The result of transformation is startling, and shows how much the musicians have grown. The lyrics explore a darker range of emotions, and the sound as a whole is much more developed. All of the tracks on this CD are amazing- none sound the same, and none are really filler. As a result, the album has a polished feel to it, and you really need to buy the cd to appriciate this. In concert, they sound just as good, and i think this demonstrates the talent this band has- a lot of bands sound great on cd but their live preformance is substandard. Scarling. is on the rise, with its music featured recently in the L-Word and a grey's anatomy episode named after Band aid covers the bullet hole. Discover it now before they reach superstardom 
Me being a Jack Off Jill fan, When i heard that Scarling was finally coming out w/this cd i wondered if it would be worth the hype. So many bands say they want to have a different sound and then they sound awful. This is not the case w/this cd. It blends together in a dark melodic mix that most Jack Off Jill fans will find refreshing 
I can honestly say that out of the 13 tracks on this CD, I can't get enough of 12...they are all THAT good. I'm a new Scarling fan, and probably one of their oldest, being 40 something. This is one CD that will stay in my car player for a long time...Thank you Scarling - hope to see you live very soon, and more than once! Nanc 
One of the best cd's i own. They are high above the bar when it comes to wit. a constant joy to listen to over and over 
If you were to define a great cd by how many memorable songs are on it, what would that number be? 2 songs?, 5 songs? There are about 10 terrific songs on this cd. I do not give it a perfect score b/c there are about 16 cuts. 10 out of 16 is still pretty darn good. When this first came out, it was in a world in and by itself. This was so eccentric, so different, so sincere, so d.i.y.. It was nerdy yet at the same time very hip. Very enigmatic. It was a band (duo) that followed no precedent, was making up things as they went on and for some strange reason...it all worked. They Might be Giants sounded like when you and your friends would make up melodies and lyrics about your own weird world...but they did it successfully. I enjoy this cd, never owned another TMBG cd, and am not that familiar with their other works. But I do like Flood, have owned it for many years and still listen to it. Is is a classic? You betcha! "Birdhouse in your Soul" is not only the best song on the cd but it is also the most conventional."Racist Friend" is a song with a very serious topic yet it is sung in almost a comically nasal tone. It should be a novelty song but the overall melody and structure keep it a legit tune. "Particle Man" is a bizarre tale of who would win in a fight among made up superheros. "Lucky Ball and Chain" is a nice example of their ability to harmonize. "We want a rock" and "Someone keeps moving my chair" are also standout tracks. Perhaps the most unique tune is "minimum wage" which is exactly what the title purports it to be, a themeatic soudntrack-sounding tune about minimum wage. The only flaw in the cd is that after the 11 or 12 track, the songs diminish in quality. This is not perfection from start to finish and there are weak songs towards the end. Overall however, there are enough quality songs on here to make this cd very desireable for any power pop fan. Highly recommende 
Of course musical tastes are subjective and to each their own. However, as an owner of all of TMBG's albums, this seems best for two reasons. #1 it has so many great pop songs that you cannot get enough of. #2 it has that weird brilliance, those insane lyrics that make you ponder whether these guys are the deepest Zen masters of all-time or just incredibly insane. Heck, either way is fine with me. If you are a fan or don't own any TMBG albums, this one is perfect for you 
I don't know this band. But I remember that looney toons "Particle Man" vid where Plucky Duck was playing Particle Man. I laughed so hard when I saw it that I almost threw up. Man, that is one of the greatest songs in life 
This was They Might Be Giants first major label album. It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums. It's probably TMBG's most popular album. It features many classic TMBG songs, like "Birdhouse in Your Soul", "Istanbul" and "Particle Man". It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns. A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans 
A bouillabaisse of rock, polka, lounge, latin, electronic, and about a dozen other music genres, Flood is as varied a pop album as has ever been recorded. John Linnell and John Flansburgh, or as they are sometimes known, "the Johns," show off their amazing melody-crafting abilities throughout Flood. Top to bottom, the songs are catchy and unique. No one, and I mean no one, writes lyrics as witty and clever - without being annoying or stupid - as the Johns. Flood is full of lyrics that will make you laugh out loud and, at the same time ask yourself, "Who dreams up this stuff?" Sample: If I were a carpenter i'd Hammer on my piglet, i'd Collect the seven dollars and i'd Buy a big prosthetic forehead And wear it on my real head Everybody wants prosthetic Foreheads on their real heads Everybody wants prosthetic Foreheads on their real heads It's not hyperbole to call Linnell and Flansburgh (under-appreciated, under-recognized) geniuses. Flood, from a commercial point of view, is probably TMBG's most successful album. Though great, fans recognize that it is rather typical of the (high) quality of the Johns' work. If you're new to They Might Be Giants, Flood is a great starting point. If you're a fan, I've said nothing here that you didn't already know. 
Possibly the catchiest, wittiest most fun-laden album you'll ever hear. This is the only 'They Might Be Giants' album i own but it's just so good i can't bring myself to listen to anything else by the band. So satisfying is the album as a whole that it's actually worked against the band for me because i simply cannot imagine that anything else they have done can compare so here i sit, in my home or on the train on the way home from work listening to the wonderful opening choral intro 'Theme from Flood' which leads into 'Birdhouse In Your Soul' which is so unbelievably catchy and well written you'll wonder why this album didn't hit the No.1 spot way back in 1990 and stay there for...well ever. Speaking of catchy, check 'Particle Man' a perverse child-like polka singalong song that is unnervingly sing-alongable (pardon my English) it isn't even funny. Then check 'Twisting' for 'Beachboys' style surf pop. Listen to 'Someone Keeps Moving My Chair' for that 'Hey, yes i feel like that too' feeling. The lyrics on some of these songs really pull wonderful heartfelt emotions from the listener. Deeply felt, humourous and injected with love and enthusiasm it remains one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time. And like i said, just so good i haven't been able to try any of the bands other output. Hmmm. 16 years on, maybe i should check out some of their other back-catalogue because if there are any other treasures like this my life could certainly do with the boost. Do yourself a favor, if you think, even for a minute you might, possibly like a 'They Might Be Giants' song from what you've heard on TV then please..please! pick up this album, it'll have you hooked 
'Birdhouse' drew me in with its sweet beat. Still not sure if it's a love letter or not, but great stuff. Their music is light with the briefest hint of vinegar--just the way I like it. However, the song that made me want to jump on the table was 'racist friend'. I heard it one night as I left a very similar situation at a friend's house. As an African-American girl, my lifelong devotion to this band started that night.To hear two white guys say they can't listen to someone's racist friend is supercalafragilisticexpialigocious. Rest of the album's great too. It only seems nerdy, but the lyrics are clever, offbeat, and unexpectedly observant. Go buy it now 
Ok, I've loved this album since its release. But, I only ever had it on cassette until 2006. Now, I'm hearing so many more parts of the music. Flood shows the full genius of They Might Be Giants, both in the complex, yet often catchy musical composition and the cryptic, witty lyrics. A joyful collection of great songs that I will sing until the day I leave this world 
This album contains some incredible songs, with a sound that sticks with you. It's certainly not for everyone, but anyone with an open mind for music should certainly give it a try. "Flood" is the album that introduced They Might Be Giants to me, with "Istanbul" and "Particle Man" being the tracks I'd heard that made me buy the album many years ago. But the rest of the tracks grew on me. Where I once skipped, I listened, and found that there was so much I'd been missing out on. Though "Birdhouse In Your Soul," "Istanbul," and "Particle Man" are perhaps some of the best known songs by They Might Be Giants to those unfamiliar with most of their work, the rest of the tracks match them in so many ways. There's a levity to much of the music, but so often, it's only a layer away from a depressing truth or two. So much of They Might Be Giants music presents this dichotomy. But it's never presented in a serious enough tone to really make you FEEL bad, but just to make you go, "Yeah, things are like that, aren't they?" I really love this whole album, but if I were to choose just three tracks that WEREN'T the weren't widely known to the public, I'd say "Your Racist Friend," "Letterbox," and "We Want a Rock. 
After listening to this album and some of Crowell's others, I had the great fortune to see him perform live. He and his band are amazing. If all country music was like this I would be a die-hard country fan. His music cuts, it makes one laugh and it is human. Before I entered the performance, a man I spoke to told me he had seen Crowell move a huge, rough looking cowboy with terrifying metal tipped boots to tears with his dual songs from a southern boy dying from AIDS in Los Angeles to his brother, and then from his homophobic twin brother with a heart-felt reply where he reaches out to his dying twin. Who can ask for more? This is currently my favorite Rodney Crowell album. But if what I heard in the live performance is in his next one, he may change my mind 
Rodney Crowell gained a stellar reputation as a singer/songwriter from the late 70's through the early 90's, via well-covered songs like "Til I Gain Control Again", "Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight", "Shame On The Moon" and "Song For The Life" and through brilliant albums like "Diamonds And Dirt" which contained FIVE #1 Country Singles on Billboard's Country Singles Chart, a feat unequalled by any other single album by any country artist. However, once free of the constraints of NashVegas, Crowell releases an album that is so non-country (in the traditional sense) and contains some of the best songs he's ever written. The songs and characters (some fictional, some not) are colored by his experiences in Houston, Texas. Many of the songs ROCK (like "Telephone Road" and "Topsy Turvy") and some are nostalgic for more innocent days ("Banks of the Old Bandera"). The tender album closer, "I Know Love Is All I Need" comes from the perspective of one who's lost both parents without being maudlin at all. Who else but a former son-in-law could get away with re-working an old Johnny Cash classic AND get the "Man In Black" to even sing on it but Rodney? ("I Walk The Line (Revisited)") But the centerpiece and true gem is the back-to-back tales of two brothers: "I Wish It Would Rain" is from the perspective of a man dying of AIDS, while "Wandering Boy" is from the perspective of his twin brother who offers him comfort. The album also features strong musicianship from bassist Michael Rhodes and guitarist Steuart Smith. There's not a bum track to be found. A solid effort from Crowell and an absolute masterpiece 
Rodney Crowell is without a doubt one of music's best songwriters (of any genre). He has always put his heart and soul into storytelling; so why not make an autobiographical album? The genius of this album is in the way it handles the topics. Heavy, menacing topics such as addiction are put to catchy acoustic guitar riffs, as in "I Wish It Would Rain." "Topsy Turvy" is a fast, pounding song--about an unhappy, abusive household. Yet, on other songs lyrics and melody go hand-in-hand: the reminiscent, upbeat "Telephone Road," the haunting and sorrowful "Highway 17", the mean-spirited, angst guitars of "U Don't Know How Much I Hate You," the hopeful, upbeat strumming on "Why Don't We Talk About It," and, most prominently, the steady, engaging rhythm of "I Walk The Line (Revisited)," a duet with Johnny Cash (a side note: it takes guts to rewrite a classic, and then ask the original singer/songwriter to sing on it; it takes skill to pull it off as successfully as Crowell does). "The Houston Kid" is a revealing, engrossing album. Sometimes you'll want to sing along, other times you'll want to cry. Featuring some of Crowell's best writing yet, it's an album that has "classic" written all over it. It's a personal masterpiece, and a triumph for country music 
As a fan since I first heard "Ain't Livin' Long Like This" this album has got to be considered his best. Rodney has matured as an artist and especially a songwriter. The album exposes Crowell's "topsy turvy" upbringing and includes tasty fills by master guitarist and longtime friend Stuart Smith. "I Know Love is All I Need" strikes a chord with anyone who has lost their parents, "I Walk The LIne (Revisited)" is simply the best Johnny Cash tribute ever, and "Telephone Road" captures a lost place and time whiles it rocks your socks off! Don't miss this one.. 
I first heard Rodney Crowell late one night on the Mountain Stage program, and was struck by his clean, expressive picking and honest telling of stories in song. THE HOUSTON KID is this and much more -- from Cajun-inflected confessions to rockabilly rave ups, the man knows what to put in and what to leave out. I was at first reminded of John Prine, but Rodney Crowell has earned respect for having his own voice, and for making the sights, sounds and debris of Houston his creative world 
I am simply a fan of good music, and as my forties have begun to pass I have come to an appreciation of how our history builds, tears down and rebuilds, who we are are human beings.. I am a HUGE fan of this CD. Rodney - who has been a staple since his days with Emmylou Harris and Her Hot Band - in this record he tells the stories he has always wanted to get out - but needed the distance to get it done right. Simply put, this one blows me away everytime I hear it - and it spends a lot of time in my CD player. It teaches, it rocks, it swings, it sings like new tires on a long stretch of highway. Do not miss this one folks, it is a classic 
Cypress Hill took the gangsta rap style of NWA, the DJ'ing of Public Enemy, and the attitude of the Beastie Boys to a whole new level. So much credit is given to Dr. Dre's The Chronic, but you can tell he got ideas for the Chronic from Cypress Hill's groundbreaking debut. Dre even later bit some of their concert style. Cypress Hill are the original hip-hop stoners. The cartoony metaphors, cannabis lingo, contrasting two-man vocals, and wicked beats and sampling make this album a classic for the ages. Although harsh for some, the lyrics were true to the street culture of the early 90's and while a little exaggerated and boisterous, taking it over the top was Cypress's style. This album was put out in a time of fresh creativity in hip-hop, something that is lacking nowadays. Their style transcended racial barriers and got a lot of people into legitimate hip-hop. All 4 of Cypress Hill's first albums were instant hip-hop classics, and their live act was top-notch. To me, in 1990's hip-hop, there were Cypress Hill and Wu-Tang Clan, and then there was everybody else 
When I bought this CD the only song I knew was "How I Could Just Kill A Man". So I took a gamble that paid of. With DJ Mugg's funky beats my homie B-Real's flow(held it down for the Mexican's like me)and Sen Dog's blunted vocals it was more than what I wanted. I thought all the songs were tight but the 3 that stood out were "How I Could Just Kill A Man" "Hand On The Pump" and "Real Estate". "Pigs" "The Phuncky Feel One" and Psycobetabuckdown" could have been better but this is a CD that won't make you regret gettin' it. Pick it up and you will see what I mean 
Their debut they could never top. B Real's rhymes are complex and imaginitive, and through subsequent releases get more and more simple. Everything about this album, the beats, samples, rhymes, it's uniquness, makes it a king among kings in the hip-hop world. Did you know the guitar sample in the refrain of How I Could Just Kill A Man is from the Jimi Hendrix song Are You Experienced 
Cypress Hill's Debut Album (along with second album "Black Sunday") is their best album effort......After Virtually coming from nowhere to take a firm stranglehold on the then floundering Hip-Hop scene, which was lacking innovation, sleazy Lo-fi fat Beats with a distinctive sound all of their own (Courtesy of D.j Muggs) , coupled with rapper "B-Real's" latino-voiced pro-marijuana rhetoric, which was to prominently feature in all their albums, so peace to mi homies B-Real, Frost Mellow Man Ace, mi homie Sen Dawg for background vocal hook ups mix-master DJ Muggs for makin' beats so god damn funky! The song Pigs is pretty much an N.W.A.-post about politicaly hypocritical cops in South Central, Lynwood, Watts, Florence, South Gate where Cypress Hill grew up in, How I Could Just Kill A Man became a chronic classic from the sticky green smelly buddah tokin' crew, Hand On The Pump is 1 of my personal favorites of theirs and the 1st music vieo of theirs I've seen, and the song Stoned Is the Way of the Walk is a hard stoner joint that is just str8 up grimy. Dr.Greenthumb's Soulja's best joints are *1, *2, *3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *10, 11?, 12, 13, 14, 16 16. 
Cypress Hill was a major breath of fresh air when they came out. They were rapping from a latinos perspective, they dropped beats that were more than dope, and wrote lyrics about everything including weed. You can't deny that as soon as you hear B-real, you know just who it is. I'd hesitate to call this the best album of theirs, but I like it just as much as "Black Sunday", "Temple Of Boom", and "Skull And Bones". Top tracks for me are "Pigs", "Hand On The Pump", "Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk", and "Born To Get Busy". It's all good though. It's a fact that in the summer of 1992, if I wasn't playing House Of Pain or the Beastie Boys, i was listening to Cypress Hill. Of course, I could pretty much say that now as well 
I can't believe anyone in their right mind would give this album anything less than 5 stars. 1) If you are a HIP HOP fan(not rock fan who ALSO likes "rap") 2) If you were actually alive when this came out(or at least old enough to ride a bike) 3) If you are an American(props to Euros keeping Hip Hop alive, but you guys have different taste) 4) And finally if you have actually listened to this album start to finish, 2 or 3 times... ...THEN YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS CYPRESS HILL'S BEST ALBUM EVER. STRATIGHT UP PRE-LOLAPALOOZA/MTV/CROSSOVER HIP HOP DOPENESS. Peace to you heads who were around when this joint dropped 
Cypress Hill is My favorite rap (Hip Hop) group right now aside of N.W.A, but N.W.A hasn't got albums comin at yah like Cypress Hill! If you want Rap,Hip Hop, and some Good Music, Get Cypress Hill! NOW! Don't sit there and Read I MEAN NOW! CYPRESS HILL LIVES ON 
"CYPRESS HILL" is simpley one of the GREATEST rap bands of all time also one of the greatest contribution's to the music world in genral! this album "BLACK SUNDAY" are by-far the very best from the almost endless "CYPRESS HILL" library. this self-titled debut was is so damn deliciously good that the kids on the hill we're able to take an almost 5 year break before they put out there sophmore follow up by then(with only one album out) they we're looked at by the hip-hop world as vterans of the game! now to this day i don't believe that i have seen any band pull that off still be going full force like the HILL IS! music fans if you don't have this album in your collection then your missing a very very vital piece your collection is incomplete or YA GOT A HOLE N YA HEAD A PHU**EN HOLE N YA HEAD!!!!!! ENJOY 
I know this is a classic but the reason I said 4.5 stars is the last few tracks wihich let it down a bit. The standout tracks are "How could I just Kill a man" "Psychobetabuckdown" and "Hand on the Pump" ia also think "pigs" is good too. This is the debut and is tight so ya gotta cop it. and thats all I have to say about tha 
This album stomps a mud hole in P-Diddy's uterus. Almost 13 years after this album has been released I still get chills when I hear "How I Can Kill a Man" Also, I dug the cholo porn in "Tres Equis". 
Edwin McCain is a master. Most people only know him as "that guy who sings "I'll Be" on Dawson's Creek." But he is much much more then that, he is a skilled musician that I have been lucky enough to see live twice. This CD is definitely good, and while its not my favorite EMB CD, its much better then most of the mainstream junk today. I'm definitely surprised Edwin didn't have atleast a top 40 hit with "Say Anything" (for all you first time listeners and "I'll Be" lovers, it will probably be your favorite track). Also the song "Couldn't Love You More" is a really good song for anyone who has ever been in a relationship that pretty much everybody was skeptical of. My favorite song on the CD is the risky "White Crosses" which tells the story of a truck full of illegal immigrants from Mexico being killed in Texas. The song is extremely compassionate and its obvious that Edwin is way above writing meaningless songs. If you're a hardcore Ed head, of course you're going to buy the CD and its definitely worth it. For the non-Edwin fans, if your looking for "I'll Be", theres a really good acoustic version of it on the CD titled "Messenger" ;- 
Screams Wisphers is another great CD from Edwin McCain and his band. The song Couldnt love you more is a great song for lovers that have ever had doubters about there love, Edwin McCain is in my opinion one of the best singer song writers out, the way he makes you feel the songs and stories with his words is something only true artist can do. Not a big radio artist but that keeps him grounded and not caught up in the HOLLYWOOD sell out that so many of these so called artist give into - A great cd by a great artist and worth twice the price the sticker has on it, nothing Edwin McCain puts out is bad, if your a true fan of REAL music youll love anything Edwin McCain puts ou 
To say this was a dissapointment is an understatement. By track three i wondering if this was the same Edwin McCain that had made the masterful 'misguided roses' because this is so BLAND! it really was a struggle to listen to the whole thing and keeo my eyes opened-radio friendly isn't the word! I guess some of the signs were showing in the tinsel and tap shoes dvd with the ultra slushy 'couldn't love you more' and 'shooting stars' what do you get as a bonus track a version of 'maggie may' so close to the original as not to make a difference! The whole point of a cover is to do your own interpetation not a note for note re-run! So what has happened in the past years to make someone as talented as McCain heap this non-entity on his fans? Well giving Pete Riley a stab at songwriting both on his own and with McCain shows a possible drying up of ideas, because Riley's songs wouldn't be out of place on a latter day Fleetwood Mac album- they are that uninspired and there is hardly any barintone sax which always added to the songs and do i hear the dreaded drum machine in the mix? Come on Edwin a couple of half way decent songs on your new album is pushing the mark a bit. I for one will view the next album with a great deal of aprehension 
I first heard Edwin play 'Say Anything' when I saw him at BB King's in NYC. A couple of months later, you could sample it on his website. I purchased the cd the day it was released. A few months later, that was the song that my husband and I danced to on our wedding night. It's a beautiful song, with intelligent lyrics. Every one of my guests were so intrigued by it, because they had never heard it before. I was proud to play it, because it caught everyone's attention, it was beautiful and perfect for my husband and I, and I wasn't cheesing everyone out by dancing to some bubblegum love song. I've been and Ed Head for 8 years now! And it is amazing songs like this that keep me coming back for more 
To say the least, this is another great release for Edwin. Say Anything, Coming Down, Shooting Stars, Couldn't love you more, are features of this great release. McCain continues to set himself apart from the rest of the music world with his unique style. Go get your copy 
Edwin McCain plays intelligent pop music. He appeals to those with good music taste while playing basic structure acoustic pop songs. What is it? Maybe it's his voice, fabulous. Maybe it's his simple songs about the world, written with just enough creative spin to make the words interesting. But, whatever it is, he's great at it. As far as this particular CD, it's not going to bring him any more popularity. There's no standout single on it, which probably means no radio time for Edwin. But, if you enjoyed his past efforts, you'll find more of the same on this album. If you're a first time listener, pick up "Messenger. 
Yesterday, I nearly fell headfirst into the carpet at the music store when I saw "Edwin McCain" on the cover of a new CD. It's been three long years, and I didn't think he would even release another album after the precipitous drop in quality of his last two albums. I was instantly nostalgic and welled up a bit, remembering how much his music has affected my life. First of all, I'm a huge fan - likely one of his biggest fans. I must admit that I was wildly disappointed with "The Austin Sessions" and "Far From Over", his fourth and fifth albums. I feared he had lost the eager edge, the creative muse, the gritty passion that led to him to pen the songs that have moved my spirit so many times. As a musican and songwriter, I learned to play guitar by learning Edwin's songs, and my own work is heavily influenced by his acoustic heartfelt sound. Edwin was my musical hero for years during the releases of his first few albums, but I was concerned that his career was nearly over. Well....he's BACK and ON FIRE with this record, and it is brilliant! Back are the beautiful melodies, satisfying woodwind textures, vivid stories, the soaring heartfelt harmonies that actually move you deep down in the heart, and the chills that creep up your back when he hits just the right note over just the right chord. I nearly cried when I came to the end of Track 13, feeling so satisfied with the music and relieved that my old hero didn't fizzle out forever. If you've ever bought one of his other CDs, you will adore this brilliant return to American music 
Fine things has already been said about Edwin McCain, this album and his other work. But I just had to let you know that the song "Couldn't Love You More" from this album is worth the album price alone! It took me straight away, and I can't get it out of my head (or my heart for that matter). Edwin constantly keeps growing as an artist, and I can't wait to see where he's headed! In Norway, his records still has no distribution, so I really hope someone wakes up and signs him here so he can sell even more albums! Summary: Just buy the album! You'll love it!!! ALL songs on this album now have five stars in my iTunes playlist 
Just when I thought Edwin couldn't do better than messenger, boy was I proved wrong! This is got to be his best work period. I have listened to the whole album at least 15 times over and still cant pick the best song. "Say Anything" , and "Couldnt love you more" are awesome acoustic replacements for "I'll Be" and "Could not ask for more". I definatly advise this as an additon to any collection. Edwin has once again out did himself. His tour on this album was awesome as well. I'll be looking foward to him comming back to Memphis real soon 
Recently, I became a huge fan of Edwin McCain's. I had seen him on VH-1's "I Love the 90's" during the months of July and August (2004) and, eventually, I decided to check into his music. At that point, I had only heard of him and not much of his music. While watching him on this show, I really liked and was very impressed by his personality, his charming and quick wit, as well as his sweet Southern accent, which further urged me to look into his recordings. You should hear his Ross Perot impersonation. Funny, funny, funny. (He also wasn't bad on the eyes.) I knew this Greenville, South Carolinian favorite had at least one song that I had heard of, but I could not recall what that, specifically, was. When I found out it was he who sang "I'll Be," I knew I had to dig deeper into his music library. That song had played on the radio for MONTHS, and I did not know whom it was. I knew only that I really, really liked it. The first placed I checked out was www.edwinmccain.com (or just www.edwin.com). Since everyone and their grandmother have a web site, I decided to go for the gold - and hit pay dirt! From there, you can check out his discography, sign up for updates on him, become a member of his "Street Army" and join the hundreds of other fans, sharing stories and information about the singer on his message board. You can also purchase Edwin merchandise (I ordered his DVD, a button and a hat). The best part of all, you can read messages from the singer himself. He has a tour journal that he updates while he is on the road, which tends to be most of the year. This, I thought, was an excellent idea. It is a great way for him to alert his fans of how he, his bandmates, and his tour are progressing. While looking into his library, I found out a few things that make Edwin quite the talent. He grew up singing in his church choir (like most great singers with soulful voices); he is down-to-earth and is always willing to stop and speak to his fans - even after his concerts. No shellin' out big bucks for meet-and-greets like other rock stars. He's a big star without having the big star attitude. I like the fact that, while he is well known across this great land of ours, he is a star who is still attainable. Ya can't say that about a lot of famous people. Most want you to stay away and not bother them. No pictures. No autographs. No hugs. Edwin welcomes his fans with open arms. According to one of my fellow "Army" members, "...he and his bandmates are the sweetest, nicest guys you could ever meet." This is something I know quite a bit about, having met some famous people myself and not always having a very good experience. Out of the experiences I have had, the only persons I've met who have been this open to their fans was Foghat. Edwin, I am guaranteed, will be the next. In October, I will have the fantastic opportunity to see him in concert, and my fellow "Army-ers" tell me I am in for a great treat. Can't wait to meet you, Edwin! His latest effort, "Scream and Whisper," is truly a breath of fresh air. It feels so natural to the ears, like "Oh! I get it! That song is supposed to play. It fits right in." And I like Rod Stewart just as much as the next person and have been a fan nearly all my life, but Rod ain't got nuthin' on Edwin's version of "Maggie May." Maia Sharp appears on "Say Anything," the album's first single. This was co-written by she, Edwin, and his guitarist, Pete Riley, (Liverpool native and new lover of Pop Tarts). "Farewell to Tinkerbell" is a quaint story about Peter Pan recounting his and Tinkerbell's history, telling of how he's grown up, moved on with his life without her and how he will keep her in his heart and always be her friend. Even though he still wants "to hear the stories of treasure ships and fights" and that she will "always" have his "everlasting love," he "can't come back to Neverland again." "Couldn't Love You More," co-written by McCain and Larry Chaney, another of his guitarists, is a romantic song of one person's love for another, forsaking others for that love, being there for that love and being in so much love that you truly could not have more than the great love you already feel for them now. Very deep and romantic. In the short time I have listened to Edwin McCain's music, I have come to learn that he writes great lyrics, even greater melodies and has the voice to back it all up. He, clearly, wears his heart on his sleeve and tells stories that has you saying to yourself, "How much of these songs apply to him personally?" I do, however, wish I had gotten to know his music when each of his earlier albums was released, because he does not always get the airplay his songs truly deserve. I could have requested some songs to help spread the word. For example, on his sophomoric "Misguided Roses," he displays his bluesy, soulful, and strong voice to go along with some playful and some serious lyrics. You need only listen to "How Strange It Seems" and "Take Me" to hear these examples. Then there is 2001's "Far From Over" - which, at that point, he was. Although I adore every song on this album, "One Thing Left" has to be my absolute favorite. It is an upbeat, flirty conversation between a musician singing on stage (Edwin, I assume) and a woman (don't know who the mystery lady is) that is sexy, sassy and makes you wanna strut to the beat. On the other hand, there is "Letter to My Mother." He was adopted. Listen to the lyrics and see if you don't get choked up. Rounding up the album is "Jesus, He Loves Me." The only thing I can say about this is, singin' in the church choir paid off. This talented man, I feel, can sing anything. You need only give him and his music a chance. In my opinion, there are no limits to his amazingly eclectic style of writing. Take the time to listen to "Sign On the Door" from his third album, "Messenger." Outstanding! Just know this...I thought Michael McDonald had soul. Edwin McCain can rock `n' roll, sing country, blues, jazz, R His lyrics and melodies are haunting at times, playful at others, can be rhetorical but always leaves you wanting to hear more. 
I know that LeToya's album has been out for a good couple of months but I am one who has to hear at least 2 songs from an artist on the radio before I take a chance on buying the album. I have to admit, the first time I heard the entire CD, I was kinda skeptical but after listening to it a 2nd time, I love it! My faves are: 2. U Got What I Need 6. She Don't 8. All Eyes on Me (f/ Paul Wall) 9. Hey Fella (f/ Slim Thug) 11. Obvious The others were okay too but those are the standouts for me. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is not into all the grandstanding and throwing her body (and weave) around in front of a camera to make herself look sexy (not mentioning any names but y'all know who I'm talking about!). This is a must-buy CD and I wish LeToya all the success she truly deserves 
This may have been a good album, but lets be honest she is not a good singer, did you now hear her performance on BET???? Her backup singers she get her record sales...I was loving her w/ "Torn" till I heard her perform it and not only was my heart torn but so were my ears. Come on now I don't care what kinds of songs she comes out with she'll never be on the same level with "B" I'm sorry: 
if you're expecting hip-hop r then this is the best cd of the year. just like hip-hop, her music samples from old soul music. then she has producers like scott storch on it. houston rappers paul wall, mike jones, and slim thug are on it. i like it 
Beyonce isn't the only diva to come out of the nixed R girl group Destiny's Child. Former member LeToya Luckett came out of nowhere this past summer and offers up her Hip Hop-tinged debut album LeToya. Her first single, the excellent sultry ballad "Torn," topped R charts across the country and deservedly so. LeToya the record is an interesting mix of R and Hip Hop elements. Songs like the aforementioned "Torn" and the club-ready "I'm Good" make for great listens. It's not a perfect disc (as tracks like "U Got What I Need" and both the "Intro" and "Outro" don't provide much but filler) but its good moments certainly make it worth a listen. If you enjoy some of the best R and Hip Hop of today's music then LeToya is for you 
Letoya is part of the original Destiny's Child Dynasty. As far as vocal ability, she can hold her own against Beyonce and Kelly. Unfortunatly, the sound and production don't showcase her abilities throughtout most of the album. The cd is off to a slow start with "U Got What I Need" and "So Special" which just deserved to be skipped. It's just slow typical r b stuff. "Torn" her commercial release is a little better but doesnt isnt 100% believable. The next few songs move to more uptempo beats but it also needs to be missed. Paul Wall outshines on All Eyes on Me but the hook is just terrible, same thing on "Gangsta Grillz" another wannabe club banger. The end slows down with much of the same as the begining. "Obvious" is a very good personal ballad, and one of my favorite songs on the album. Overall, a couple good songs and looking forward to better songwriting and production in the sophomore effort. 
Buy this album!!!!! This was a very good album from one of the lost destinys child members. This album was at the top of the charts, and its not hard to figure out why. This album has an old school sound especially on tracks like u got what i need, she don't and torn. Overall this album is a definite must have 
When I heard "Torn" on the radio, orginally I didnt know who the person was singing it. I didnt realize who it was until I was watching CD USA. I was so suprised when I found out it was her. I had been waiting on her CD to come out for so long til I just gave up. When I bought her CD I was satisfied. The wait was worth it. She had been through so much, when she finally decided to come out on her own and stamp her name on it, she had to make sure it was on point. And her CD, is 
I love this CD. It is tight. I love her soprano. She shines as well as Beyonce and Kelly. This album is the best way to reintroduce herself to the world. This album is a quality mix of musical sounds and styles. She took the whole Screwed Up style and used it for an R record like this one "Gangsta Grill". This album will put Houston on the music map. This album will undoubtedly be successful as Beyonce's B'Day album. NOW IT IS LETOYA'S TURN TO THE SPOTLIGHT!!!! 
This CD is great and worth while. Much better than BDa 
I like everything about this album, you can tell she worked hard on this album. 1. U Got What I Need - 9/10: I love the beat and the vocals, but something wasn't right. 2. So Special - 10/10 Great song 3. Torn - 10/10 Hottest R song of 2006. Great Melody, and Great Vocals 4. What Love Can Do - 9/10 I think this song is underrated. 5. She Don't -10/10 Like nothing i have heard its different. But fire. 6. Tear Da Club Up- 10/10 I like this song because if you blast it, it makes you want to dance. 7. All Eyes On Me - 9/10 I like the way she put paul wall in this song. 8. Hey Fella - 10/10 One of my favorite songs on the album. Got the hottest melody and the collabo was hot 9. Gangsta Grillz - 10/10 10. Obvious - 10/10 I just love this song 12. 8/10 I like this song 13. This Song - 10/10 My second favorite song on the albu 
One of the best albums from the UK in sometime. The sound and intensity reminds me of The Jam which were hugely influencial. Give the album a little bit of time, next thing you know, you'll be hard pressed to remove it from your player 
Big Black Captain Beefheart the Talking Heads Brian Eno King Crimson Ennio Morricone Slint Pere Ubu See that list? That list, as short as it is, is a list of bands that had an impact, no matter how small, it was a lasting one, on rock music. These performers streched the boundaries and created new genres or at the very least took stale genres and shook them up, creating flawless works of art. Arctic Monkeys, and their bretheren of pseudo-talking heads/80's brit rock/dance rock trash are the complete and total opposite. This is some of the most lifeless, shallow, vapid, uninspiring and unoriginal trash since KC and the Sunshine band. But, brits being brits, they just have to have one band to shove down the rest of the world's throat, *ahem* Oasis, then, a year later they completely disown them, because, well, everyone has jumped on the train, so why stay on when it's overcrowded with buffoons? But that's just the point, this music, from the second it was conceived was about as meaningful as a Cheech and Chong movie, this isn't music, this is audio-candy, absolutely no value what so ever. I mean, I knew going in to this, I got it from my library, I wasn't about to pay money to cement the fact that these guys are total garbage, that it was going to be a miserable experience, and the opening track began to steer me in a more optimistic direction, but by the time "I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor" came on, I was seconds away from tossing the disc out my car window. When all is said and done, Arctic Monkeys are going to be right up there with the Kaiser Chefs and The Bravery as bands that all the little empty headed sheep just gobbled up and forgot about 2 months later 
I just bought this on itunes mainly because I saw them play "a certain romance" on saturday night live and it inspired me to play my guitar along with the recording. the rest of the album is good but i still think "a certain romance" is well beyond anything else on the album. i actually find the single "i bet you look good on the dancefloor" kind of annoying but some of the other tracks are great 
arctic monkeys rock. litteraly. they are a great alternative rock group that cant help but make you want to turn up the volume and just start jamming. these guys are much better compared to many other upbeat rock groups that are trying to make it out there. these guys are definately legit. songs that i have enjoyed on this cd include fake tales of san francisco, a certain romance, and i bet you look good on the dance floor. like i said these guys are great and are bound to make you feel happier and more energetic when you listen to them. definately a good cd 
Arctic Monkeys are like a drug...or should be, anyways... Each and every one of the songs just blows you away... They are fantastic!!!! every single person with some kind of taste for high-quality music should own this album, no doubts about that. 
Okay. So we've heard Brits say you have to be a Brit to like it. I don't think this is true. I'm from Tennessee in the USA. I'm from a line of Irish/Brit/Welsh immigrants and I think generally most working class families in either the US or UK can understand the feelings behind the songs. Sure, some may not know what Mardy means or what trackie bottoms are... but there's always room to learn, right? Is it fair to say Brits won't like the Kings of Leon or The Strokes because they can't relate to the southern rollicking or New York nights, respectively? I don't think so. Minute cultural details definitely don't take away from the human spirit of songs 
I think in 20-30 years from now, we will still be listening to Arctic Monkeys... This is one of the best albums I've ever listened too, enjoy 
It's amazing that a musician as sonically adventurous as Prince would become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, but in the 1980's that's just what happened. And yet at the height of his popularity, Prince never seemed to try to cater to the masses. "Around the World in a Day", which followed the runaway success of "Purple Rain", is evidence of Prince's uncompromised vision. Easily the most experimental album of his career, Prince combines Beatles-like psychadelia (the title track), classical music ("Condition of the Heart"), political protest ("America"), standard Prince libido ("Tamborine") and good old-fashioned pop ("Raspberry Baret"). "ATWIAD" is second only to "Sign 'o the Times" as my personal favorite Prince album 
I love Prince music. Some looked at this album as a step down from Purple Rain but that is complete b.s. It is more of a creative artistic move from Prince and The Revolution. My personal favorite track is The Ladder. The back up vocals are superb from Wendy, Lisa, Susannah, and Taja Sevelle. I love it. 
After the albums 1999 and Purple Rain, Prince was already multi-selling superstar and he could basically do what he wanted, he went one step further again and released a album that is pop-psychedelic with songs simular to Beatles "Sgt. Pepper" but with more pop. This album wasn't the biggest hit and critics often critisize it for it differences from previous albums. However, they're all wrong. This album is fantastic, both musically since it feautures loads of fascinating instruments and lyrically it explores new levels of Prince's brillianct song writing. The colourful cover of this album is a good way of descibing it's versatility. "Around the World In One Day" is too unique too not be enjoyed. It starts with the title track, it got both African percussion, flutes and a whole lot off odd instruments. It stands for a good intro to what is coming. "Paisley Parc" his second song was also his new label. Musically it gives a good preview on the psychedelia. The song is about an utopia, (an alternate world) where everything is good and people get along. "Condition of the Heart" is a ballad, it starts with piano 2:30 minute before he starts singing. This melancholy song is exceptionally long, no hit single but good ballad. "Raspberry Baret" was the big hit from this album! And listening to it you can understand why, it's cathcy as hell. "Raspberry beret, The kind U find in a second hand store Raspberry beret, And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more" "Tambourine" is really odd, but coming from Prince and this album in particular I'm not surprised. "Close my eyes what's it like,What's it like inside your tamborine?" and "All alone by myself Me and I play my tamborine". "America" is funky as hell (Especially it's riff), the song itself critisise political America and it's fight to destroy communism in the 80's instead of taking care of it's own citizen. We can draw paralles today to the Iraq War that's been a political priority. "Pop Life" is my favorite pick of this album, it's a very cathcy song and it's about how celebrity status can change people's life for the worse. So true. "The Ladder" is simply amazing, it a slow paced song that feautures saxophone, it's starts spoken where Prince desribes a king from the land of sinapeny that didn't deserve to be. He doesn't do anything right and does not know where he comes from. Neither the love from Electra is adeqaute for him, all he wants is "The Ladder". The song is about finding yourself I think, and finding the right path in life. Something that is very difficult, for everyone. If you wanted something very heavy, the you got it with "Temptation". It feautures horns and heavy guitar riffs. The song is about what the title suggest. Overall, A diffrent but fantastic album, Prince had the guts to record a very unique album, both musically and lyrically. The album is not as much about tabu's and sex as other album, this one's more political and personal. Before you listen to critics, listen to the album yourself and you should enjoy this other side of Prince. 
Considered a curveball to those Prince fans that were expecting Purple Rain 2 in 1985. But here, on Around the World In a Day, Prince shows off a good bit of his Beatles influences, along with bringing together alot more of The Revolution's collectively talents. Once again, Prince broadens your horizons as you listen to some of his most challenging and adventurous pop songs ever released. The opening Indian-Beatles flute playing of the title track, along with psychadelia of "Paisley Park," the opera "Condition of the Heart," the pop-catchiness of "Raspberry Beret," the stripped-down bit of funk in "Tamborine," the Hendrix-inspired "America," the genius questioning of "Pop Life," the personal "Ladder," and the climax of "Temptation" will definitely change your outlook on Prince if you haven't heard it enough of his stuff. Prince's most creative journey begins here, as "Parade" doubles up on it, along with the masterpiece "Sign 'O' the Times" in tow... Get ready for an adventure 
"Around the World in a day" has now become my favorite Prince recording, even gaining advantage over his other five flawless records-"Dirty Mind","1999","Purple Rain","Parade" and "Sign O'the Times" since it features some of Prince's most adventurous and challenging pop songs. Since "Dirty Mind" that he'd established himself as a polymath of pop, bringing together whichever styles he felt adequate, but for "Purple Rain"s successor he delivered a record steeped to its neck in psychedelia and retro pop that surprisingly sounded fresh after its multi million selling predecessor's lavish grandiosity. And it boasts over half a dozen formidable tunes to add to his already exceedingly fruitful catalog. 
Who died and made the Beatles the model for psychedelic records? If truth be told this record is by far better and more complex. After the major success of Purple Rain, Prince pulled a fast one on the pop scene and moved full speed ahead with ATWIAD. Elements of all kinds of music representing a myriad of cultures abound on this recording, hence the title. With lyrics that include religious thought, politics, sex, utopian views, heartbreak, lust and drug use, just to name a few, this is one of his best. The climax (no pun intended) is Temptation, which is probably one of the most intense songs he's made regarding sexual over-indulgence. I don't recall hearing anything that deep on Sgt. Pepper. 
Yes, Prince was one of the biggest stars in popular music back in 1984. With the project, "Purple Rain", both the film and classic soundtrack, he was able to go completely mainstream. Everything about the project was phenomenal: the fashion, the sound, the style, and most importantly, the music. But, the following year, Prince just had to push the envelope. The album, "Purple Rain" was still on the charts, selling millions of copies; but everyone wanted a sequel. Everyone who enjoyed "Purple Rain" and were expecting a sequel got "Around The World in a Day". When I first listened to this album, I asked myself if Prince had a bad acid trip. The trippy album art was equivalent to The Beatles' 1967 recording, "Sgt. Pepper's", the production was more glossy, and his sound was just completely different. It just wasn't raw and edgy anymore. The title track, "Around The World in a Day" is a middle-eastern like song with him doing a quirky meditation. "Paisley Park", which is named after his recording studio, is a psychedelic-utopian track with Prince doing a lot of strange, yet emotional imagery. "Condition Of The Heart" is probably one of Prince's best ballads. The song starts with a brief, symphonic sound bite and then it goes into an infectious piano line, with him singing some touching lyrics about a girl that is in love. "Rasberry Beret" is one of those songs everyone should at least recognize on this album. It's one of those commercial-sounding campfire songs with everything you would love in a pop song, and the special part about it is that he mixes some Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds influences with his sound and creates a brilliant piece of art. He also sings some funny, yet weird imagery in the song. It's just the climax of the album. "Tambourine" is a drum-inspired, funk jam. "America" is a quirky political cut with him talking about America's negative issues. The song sounds a lot like a James Brown tune, with its pounding drum machine patterns and wailing guitars sounds. "Pop Life" is another political cut, but this one is a little more introspective. To me, it's a song about how negative poverty really is, as he covers and talks about everything from drugs to fashion. "The Ladder" sounds like a gospel tune with Prince talking about how to reach heaven. Wendy and Lisa shares most of the vocals with Prince, over a lighthearted beat. The last track, "Temptation" is probably the strangest song on the album. He has a steaming, hot conversation with God, that just makes this whole cut notorious. Overall, the album, Around The World in a Day" was an experiment. With this album, he took the riskest challenge in mixing his sound to the 1960's pyschedelia sound. No one in the 1980's had ever heard an album so creative and unique, that just showed an influential artist doing something different. It was a backlash to many fans who loved the stunning "Purple Rain" album, but it was a tremendous effort. It is definitely worth a listen (especially if you have a good pair of quality headphones). B 
Going full bore psychadelic with this album, Prince lost some of his momentum and probably some of his fan base. Raseberry Beret was a hit, but I have a feeling this album sold a lot less than Purple Rain and I know it's less esteemed. However, it's still quite brilliant. Prince's appopriation of psychadelic stylings is quite accomplished: the songs are brilliant, and the arrangements are trippy. There is some funk, but little: this is a "weird" album, the way they designed it, and it works. Some of it is very political, like America. Some of it is very insanely bizare, like the epic Temptation where Prince speaks with God about getting laid. Definitely Prince's "mad artist" album (or okay "one" of his "mad artist" albums) and not for everybody but worth having 
Now, I know I'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about. I must admit that the first time I heard this album I was not that thrilled by it. But the more I heard it, it quickly became one of my favorites. I think this album is very underated and quite brilliant. I believe that this album allowed Prince to develope as an artist in a big way. 
My father was a big fan of Broadway musicals. I remember going to see the Pajama Game and Damn Yankees in a summer stock theater in Warwick R.I. which contributed to me developing my own love for musicals in the 50's and 60's. This recording though in monaural is an excellent reproduction of the LP record my father had and I used to listen to (sans scratches!). I would recommend this to any person who used to like these old classics. I would like to see a local theater group do this some day before it's completely forgotten. The interviews with the composer/lyricist and notes in the CD were wonderful too 
A monster hit when it opened in 1954, and still a staple of community theatre groups, PAJAMA GAME has a delightfully refreshing score that never takes itself too seriously. On the whole it offers a better-than-average number of stand-out songs: "I'm Not At All in love", "Hey There", "Small talk", "Steam heat", "Hernando's Hideaway" and the ensmble "7 1/2 Cents." There are, however a few stumbles. "A new Town is a Blue Town" is dreary. "Her Is" is silly although the Bob Fosse dance routine made it work on stage. Both these were dropped from the movie version, so I suspect the authors also felt this material was weak. The movie retained all of the original cast leads except for Janis Paige as Babe (replaced by Doris Day.) Day sings Babe's songs better, so your choice between the cast album and the movie soundtrack will depend on whether you need the whole score or not. As for ths reissue...once again Sony has done a first-rate job. The sound is full bodied and rich, though necessarily mono, and the package includes some well-written liner notes 
Super score. Two standards of the genre: Hey There and Hernando's Hideaway, but also a number of outstanding production numbers and duets: "Seven and a Half Cents", "Steam Heat", "I'll Never Be Jealous Again", "There Once Was a Man". Most of the singing is excellent but sometimes I have to admit Janis Paige isn't on pitch and I prefer (dare I say it) Doris Day in the movie. John Raitt is the professional he always was. This is a 50's musical through and through, filled with serious love songs, comedy with a satirical bite, and endless energy. The extra tracks on this CD are nothing too wonderful, with excerpts from a pretty banal interview with composer Jerry Ross, but they do include a song you won't hear (for good reason -- despite inteviewer Mike Wallace's glowing support it is a pretty bad song) in the show. Want to know why this show was so good: George Abbott, John Raitt, Bob Fosse, Harold Prince, Adler and Ross, Eddie Foy, Jerome Robbins, Carol Haney, Peter Gennaro. Yes, there are shows with a power-packed line-up like that, that have been bad, but not many. Enjoy the memories this will bring back 
There is nothing bad to say about this CD. The sound is good, it is well-priced, and it contains a song not found on earlier Pajama Game albums (as well as some interesting interviews) 
by 1974 KISS was the biggest band in the world and the rocked on their legendary live album "ALIVE" includes the Greatest party hard song of all time "Rock n Roll all Nite" "Deuce" "Strutter" "Hotter than Hell" "C'mon Love me" many more head banging classics. The Album is most must have if your a KISS fan, fantastic live tracks, "SO LETS ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NITE PARTY EVERY DAY 
I received this LP as my 9th birthday present when it had just come out, and recently bought a used copy of the remaster of it. All the complaints about how artificially-enhanced this album is are spurious, as if 3/4 of the "live albums" in history aren't re-constructed and optimized for maximum effect in the post-production. Eddie Kramer did an amazing job, and his role was central in making this one of the ear-splatteringest, heaviest records of all time. I listened to the remaster in headphones on 11 and afterwards I had to lie down it was so head-crushingly loud. The versions of the tunes on this make their studio counterparts sound like "Alvin and the Chipmunks Play Kiss". Every song just completely obliterates its corresponding appearance on the first 3 albums that preceded it, as if their studio records were just a run-through and the live one was meant to be "here's our songs played by Satan on steroids" by comparison. What's telling is that there are no visuals, and despite this band's reliance on the poly-pyrotechnic stage show and all the criticism about how the theatrics were there to conceal the crappy music, the tunes stand up just fine. The truth is that without good tunes nobody would have cared that the drumkit was levitating or that the bass player was breathing fire. Someone said that in the '70s even the bad music was great, and the very worst twaddle on this album is like Vivaldi compared with the crap that passes for music today. Jessica Simpson couldn't write songs this good, even if she were to receive Brian Wilson's brain in a transplant... that's how hopeless things have gotten. This record just roars and blows your head off from start to finish, every song just builds and builds the momentum... let's just say it's worth a Deuce, even if it does put yet more money into the misogynistic, greedy hands of Gene Simmons. 
KISS' first few albums did nothing to convey the showmanship of this original foursome. "Alive" took the band from being an oddity and attention getter to all out stars. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons recall time after time in various interviews, how fans remarked they were better live, and wished there was a way to share that. Well, these dynamic "rock-trapeneurs" had the will and found the way to get this experience captured. This was the first ground-breaking live album, that spawned a popular trend of captured live performances.. After "Alive" artists showed their chops by doing a live album (Peter Frampton, Bob Seger, Cheap Trick, Ted Nugent, etc). This pre-dates MTV and pre-fab artists with PR, wardrobe and marketing departments in the wings. This was rock and roll at it's finest. This release made "Rock and Roll All Nite" a modern classic. At age 13, Metaldiva's very first hard rock concert in 1976 was seeing Kiss at Olympia Stadium in Detroit. It was the winter following this concert which was recorded downtown at Cobo Arena. This was when you could get a ticket for about 20 bucks and it was the ONLY way to see your favorite artists AND you had to show up at school the next day wearing a t-shirt to proved you were there. This is during the rock heydays when you experienced the performance with the artist and musicians and lip-synching was for American Bandstand only. "Alive" truly captures the band on it's way to international stardom and becoming a marketing phenom. The energy from those now famous Detroit audiences is electric. Every song is good, solid New York rock and roll. Don't miss "Black Diamond" with lead vocals by Peter Criss. His seldom heard lead, is the voice of the time, gravelly and classic. Although you can't see the show, there's enough sparkle in the tracks to feel the excitment. This stands the test of time because the music is just plain good. When it comes to music, you can do acrobatics and shocking things on stage and get a little radio play and record sales, but to last for decades, you have to have good solid music. Kiss does on "Alive" and many subsequent albums that followed. The shocking on stage antics, though outrageous at the time, seem rather mild today, but they, with Alice Cooper, took rock from just something to listen to, to shows you couldn't wait to get in to. Rockgod, my husband, was part of the entourage which went in 1976 and was at the tender age of 14, and my first boyfriend. In 2000, we saw them on their farewell tour, with Ted Nugent, in Sacramento, CA. We got a few seconds of radio-time on the local classic rock station as we celebrated 25 years together and 25th anniversary of that first concert for the both of us. They were never better!!! Our metalbabies adore them now, too. Metaldiva Sez: This is a classic first of 70's rock performances that anyone can enjoy. These gentlemen received a well deserved nod at the VH1 Rock Honors. If you love hard rock, shock rock, glam rock, KISS will satisfy all your needs.. Get it home and enjoy... 
This is one of the best live albums of all time. I grew up on it! must have bought it 6 - 8 times over the years on all formats! But the fact that they still have the list at $24.98 is absurd! Especially when all the older cds are listed at 11.98!!! 2 @ 11.98 is less than the list on this double cd!! that is rediculous to get such a list on a 30 yr old cd dont ya think? I know the record co. knows that this is the best selling catalog Kiss cd, but gimme a damn break! 18.98 would be sufficient. 
...should be in everyone's collection who calls themselves a fan of Rock and Roll! This album brings back so many memories of my childhood---a 9 year old boy absolutely Enchanted by these four characters. I very much had a fascination with the band at that young age...almost to the point of "worshiping" them. And as for my parents, they had the typical views of this band that most parents who had kids that were consumed with KISS---"Knights in satan's service" who were hell bent on brainwashing as many youths as they could. Well, many, many years later I/we know that wasn't really the case. These were simply four adequate(yes, I said adequate) musicians who were inventive enough to come up with a sound, look and persona to leave a lasting impression on the R-n-R World. As for the actual live album, they don't get much more energetic and powerful as here on 'Alive'. For musicians who have been dubbed by some as "sub-par", these guys were sure ON that night(although there have been rumors(?) concerning this show having been "doctored-up". At any rate, this concert embodies everything I know to be a great show---good music played with passion, crowd interaction and a memorable stage act. And the sheer'rawness'of the album does nothing to take away from this splendid listening experience ...as a matter of fact, I would credit this 'rawness' for me returning to this album somewhat frequently(well probably not that frequent, though I do adore this CD). And like I hinted at above, Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter ARE valid musicians despite the "Flak" they have been given over the years. Besides Gene and Paul being good solid vocalists/players, I consider Ace to be a very original, creative guitarist(though possibly lacking in aural inventivness).And I love the parts and solos he comes up with---there's something pleasing about being able to hum his memorable guitar solos. And forget about Ringo(love you man)...Peter Criss is soley responsible for my aspirations to be a drummer---I remember(as that 9 year old) how enthraled I was listening to his solo in "100,000 Years". I didn't understand all the banter Paul was talking---Vodka, Gin, Tequila and getting "high" during the crowd participation part of the song, but I did understand a couple of things at that tender age.....I loved that 'Catman' drummer and wanted to be just like him!(BTW, I consider my self a lifelong drummer who did many a Halloween gig dressed as the 'Cat'). Of course, being much older now(38), I have certainly discovered much more talented drummers and musicians out there, but these four 'masked men' will always hold a special 'majic' for me. So if your unfortunate enough not to have this as part of your collection, I would more than recommend 'Alive'(along with 'Alive II')....just don't expect anything too "meaningful"....DO, however, expect to hear one of the most important live albums ever recorded, full of youthful passion and good-old Rock and Roll FUN! ****As a mysterious side note---During one of our family moves to Florida when I was 11, my Lp copy of Alive(and AliveII)strangely disappeared?.....Mom never 'fessed-up' to it, but as is said, "with age comes wisdom"!  
This is without a doubt, at the top of the greatest live albums ever released. 30 years later it still sounds great! 
Taken back into the studio to fix the sound of breaking strings and an off key note here and there, this album still stands as the greatest live album ever recorded (unless of course you want all your favortie bands to keep breaking strings in their live recordings so you can listen to it over and over again). While some will say it was done in the studio it's funny how producer Eddie Kramer's fish story keeps getting bigger with each passing year (and it's equally funny how some people swallow his load). By 2007 he'll probably say the whole album was recorded with a kazoo, and it was only his incredible engineering skills that made it sound like a live album with a band. Nevertheless, the energy level is higher and the band is tighter than most. The song writing is excellent. This was KISS at their best, because this was recorded when KISS was still hungry. This is a young band going all out live... YOU WANTED THE BEST YOU GOT THE BEST... we most certainly did 
Well, thank you for your juvenile opinion! If you're under 13, this album is not for you. If you think extra applause added to a live album ruins it, grow up and smell the hormones, study a little marketing, and apply some 'real' to your 'ideal'. If you are 16-17, male, and not too new-agey/progressive/politically-correct/feminine, etc. you will appreciate one of the finer live albums from the hard rock 70's. The songwriting is neither heady, nor intellectual. The schtick is heavy, just like the make-up. It's theatre, folks. Take it for what it's worth. As a raging adolescent from that time, an aficionado of all things Nugent, Aerosmith, ACDC, Zeppelin, Scorpions, UFO, Montrose, etc. etc. etc. As a teenage mutant non-ninja non-turtle making his first concert (1975) a Kiss concert, trust me: this album rocks; the people who were there were enthusiastic, and so were the ones they added after the fact. 
I am not what you would call a soldier in the Kiss Army(and also I am DEFINITELY not a fan of their Wal-Mart like marketing schemes). Their studio albums to my ears were weak and a lot of their songs didn't work in that environment. The live show was their strength, and this album proves it(yes, I know there were some studio touchups, but NO "live" album is truly 100% live, except for bootlegs". If it weren't for this album, nobody would be talking about Kiss today. The songs have more power, and the guitars are much more distorted and rawer than on the studio albums. The real reason to own this album is for Ace Frehley's lead guitar. Ace was not the most technical guitarist by far, but his playing was melodic and there was some real soul underneath the makeup. As the title says this is the album that launched a million guitar players. Nearly every rock guitarist I know that grew up in the 70's has said that Ace was the man that made them want to pick it up. Anybody who says different is LYING!! Trust me. This, Alive II and the first Ace Frehley solo album are all the Kiss you could ever need, and are the only ones worth lining Gene $immon$ pockets for. Anything after the makeup came off is to be avoided. 
I've read some reviews knocking this album for various reasons. THEY ARE ALL WRONG!!! This is the finest live album of all time and certainly one of Kiss' shining moments. Yes, there was some studio touch ups done on it. I hate to tell you folks, there are studio touch ups on ALL live albums and I don't care what bands say differently. The reviewers that knock this album are waiting for the second comming of hot air bands like ELP and Yes. This is in your face Rock and Roll at it's bes 
First let's get this straight... I am primarily a underground Hip Hop fan, and even though I hail from the south, I usually do not go into this uncharted territory First of all... I know for a fact that amazon's track listing is wrong. I do not know the right one, cause I do not have the CD case anymore. All the song's on this are ok, except the merengue mix of get low. The best track is the last one, which the name, despite what amazon called it is dirty dancing, and it is a very good song, with a R girl that can sing good. The second disc is tha ish too. The behind the scenes takes you thru Atlanta and other various places where where lil jon advertises his album, performs live while people fight in the audience, and even a strip club with some fine rump shaking, if I must say myself. He also tell's you the secret ingrediant's to crunk juice. The song I dont give a F*** has about the crunkest music video ive ever seen. Even though I hate the first minute of the song. It shows Jon the eastside boyz driving in a lowrider up to the club, hopping out the ride, knocking out everyone in line, and rushing the security all while screaming out " I don't give a f*** n*gga! " This song is no classic. But it is good what it is made for, and that is why I gave it a 4/5, cause it is crunk as hell. If this wasnt a crunk album though I would have given it a 1/5. If you want lyrical album's go to GZA, or Immortal Technique, not here. ok? But im sure you already knew that. This is Hip Hop's answer to Metal, and Mosh Pit Music 
not very nice....acording to me 
ight ight dis my review disc one 1.get low (remix) 8/10 pretty crunk but not as good as the original 2.get low (meringue mix) 7/10 kinda anoying 3.get yo weight up 9/10 this is a f*ckin crunk azz song 4.throw it up (remix) 6/10 this sucks! its almost the same as the original and the took out da best part and put in some gay G-unit sh*t!!!!!!!! 5.put yo hood (remix) 10/10 this is probobly da best song on here 6.what they want 1,000,000/10 never mind dis is da most crunkest song on da f*ckin CD!!!!!!! 7.dirty dancin 9/10 another crunk song disc two 1.get low video 10/10 dis video has lots of azz 2.play no games video 10/10 dis is funny as hell! 3.i dont give a.... video 9/10 pretty crunk 4.put yo hood up video 10/10 dis is PIMPIN!! 5.bia bia video 8/10 cool 6.i like dem girlz video 11/10 dis is crunk dis is lil jons best song!!!!! 7.behind the scenes 10/10 its crunk so watch it all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Allright if you know me from my reviews you probably know that this is the last review I will write in a while (At least until Jon's next album comes out) Track by track info (As Usual): 1. Get Low Regae Remix: 10/10 Exellent Remix. Same Bass, Same Chorus, but with difrent Lil Jon verse and features a verse from Elephant Man and one from Busta Rhymes. 2. Get Low Merengue Mix: 8/10 NOT bad but I seriously doubt this song can fit with a latin beat nicely. 3. Get Your Weight Up: 8/10 Good track with T.I and 8ball but a little pointless and the beat sounds a little familiar to me. 4. Throw it up Remix: 9/10 Same Song but Pastor Troy's outro was replaced with Young buck's verse. (And then Lil jon returned the favour by producing "Shorty wanna Ride" for him) 5. Put yo Hood Up Remix: 10/10 Pretty Crunk Everything is perfect. 6.What They Want: 8/10 Exellent Beat similar to the Youngbloodz' "Damn!" in overall a good track but a little stupid. 7. Dirty Dancin': 8/10 Yet another Oobie contribution to Jon's album. An OK track. DVD: All the videos are hot and the behind the scenes so watch it all. 
I don't know about this Lil Jon. His taste of beats and sounds are laughable. How does someone with no talent make it into the music industry? I guess its not hard. I've listened to a few songs on this cd and couldn't bear to hear anymore of his ranting and raving about absolutely nothing. He doesn't even rap! An hour of yelling? I mean, come on! All he does is yell about the same subject, over and over. He and other rappers, dare I mention from the south, need to reaserch the roots of true hip-hop and come up with something a whole lot better. And to all who may think I'm just a hater, I just like good music. Its not my fault I don't like senseless crap 
Lil Jon has been the reason why the Dirty South has blown up and has taken over. He's helped artists like Youngbloodz, Usher, Bone Crusher, Ying Yang Twins, Pitbull, Ludacris and even more gain commerical success. This album is filled with remixes and some material. The major single off the album "Get Low Remix" features up and coming Elephant Man, Busta Rhymes and of course the Ying Yang Twins. The next song is the "Get Low Merengue Remix" which was featured on the music video at the end. "Get Your Weight Up" features the Dirty South's finest of T.I. and 8ball. "Throw It Up Remix" is was feeling a lot with Young Buck and Pastor Troy which runs for about 6 minutes. The best song on the album IMO is "Put Yo Hood Up Remix" with Jadakiss, Petey Pablo Roy Jones Jr who saids some things in the beginning of the song to get things hyped. Jadakiss owned this track and I can't even stop listening to his part and Chyna Whyte came strong too. "What They Want" is a club hit with Chyna Whyte and Ying Yang Twins. The beat reminds me of the Youngbloods "Damn" if you listen closely. The last track is a song with Oobie called "Dirty Dancin". The DVD features music videos such as Get Low, Play No Games, Bia Bia, etc. This is an exceptional extras album by the King Of Crunk Lil Jon. You can pick the album up even if its just for the videos 
He who needs no introduction (or a lengthy one) is back with Free To Worship. A fair assessment is that chronologically the Winans, Commissioned and Kirk Franklin shaped the contemporary gospel sound over a decade or so. Mr Hammond was central to Commissioned and his influence can be heard in most recording of the US gospel genre. Free To Worship is solid enough. But it's difficult to see creative evolution from previous albums. There are new songs (best is the classy `My Heart Is For You' tripping along confidently, `More Of You' and `Simply Put' are sweetly sincere) but, as they stand, most could have be done and presented on an album ten years ago. So here's more of the Fred Hammond we know and love, who has blessed us no end for over two decades. But tenacious young lions have paid homage, done their apprenticeship and are fit to take over the pride. Without naming names, I've heard at least three different albums this year from such young lions that would simply eclipse this. Make no mistake, you will enjoy Free To Worship - there's also the nice touch of a bonus DVD. But this fare no longer stands alone. If anything it lags behind quite a few releases in instrument choices and original creativity in arrangements. To coin a phrase familiar to the artist, `ordinary just wont do' - yet there's stuff around that makes Free To Worship sound ordinary. 
I have never really been a Fred Hammond fan. I haven't like any of his releases since Spirit Of David. This cd however changes that for me. This cd was REALLY REALLY a great effort. The songs really touched me in a special place. No Greater Love is one that I'll love forever 
This CD is not Fred's best but it does not have to be his best to get a 5 star rating. His songs are so honest from More of You to Simply Put. There is no song on this album that I could say is the best because the album has such quality from 1-14. There is a variety of songs and it adds to a complete package with such depth. As always, his lyrics are superior to almost anybody in the gospel business. If you are thinking about it, get it because this CD is awesome 
The songs on this record are Timeless! Tracks 1-4 are my favorites so for, but the CD as a whole is amazing. I've been a Fred fan for 15 years......This CD captures the best of Fred Hammond. Buy It! Buy It! Buy It 
I gotta put it out there...This album is awesome! The new anthem to reign in the history of Fred's Hits is "Lord Your Grace." If you haven't heard this song and if your radio stations are not pumpin it, some ums wrong...It's the kind of song that you can't help to have on repeat. And if you find yourself saying, "Your Favor Is Just What I Needed," don't be surprised! That's the power of the song! Other great songs are: Track 1 - My Heart Is For You Track 2 - He'll Do It Track 4 - This Is The Day (Charleston Beat!!!) Track 6 - Everytime I Think Track 7 - Keep Praising (A Must See on the accompany DVD!) Track 8 - No Greater Love Track 11 - I Won't Complain (Every church choir will be singing it soon) Use the bonus DVD disc that comes with the CD. It will hold you until the November 21st release. All I can tell you is to have some TISSUE handy and some space to DANCE cuz this CD rocks!!! 
When you first listen to the CD, there is a tendancy to unfairly judge it by the opening numbers of others like "He Lives", "Spirit of David", etc. (which evokes immediate power). Then again, it's called "Free to WORSHIP" (smile). This CD is reminescent of a FH concert. (You owe to yourself to be in the midst of one). The whole thing is great, but the modulation on "No Greater Love" is Shekinah Glory/Throne Room material. Never - ever disappointed 
It's always great to see a Legend demonstrate that he's still in the arena- I had believed that Fred had hung up his front-line battle gear in exchange for a more 'advisory' statesman role- you know ...retire, take a back seat counsel the young 'uns while the NEW BRED, i.e. Isreal and friends, took over the front-lines.... That was... until I heard this CD!! Not only is Fred back- but he is again on the front lines of innovative worship music which ushers us into the secret place and keeps our spirits basking in contemplating the goodness and grace of Our Heavenly Father even after we have left it. Man oh Man oh Man....what a joy and total refereshing it is to hear a complete album again. There are songs which will not be your immediate favourites but, they'll eventually 'sneak-up' on you and you'll find yourself waking up singing them. Beyond the cliches and hype this latest offering is clearly from a soldier, wounded in the battle of life, but like a true soldier he's back in the theatre of war and is more formidable than ever. This is probabaly the most deeply personal of Fred's work, for obvious reasons, but he again shows us that not only is it possible to praise during the pain but that it's a pre-requisite for our very survival to do so. You can't find this album in stores in The Bahamas today ( all sold out until November delivery- so Amazon is doing brisk expedited shipping busisiness) but if you want to drink deep and be intimate again with Our Heavenly Father......run and take hold of this album 
This CD has to grow on you, when it does, it will take root and minister to your soul! I especially like "More of you" and "Simply Put". The first 5 tracks are my absolute favorites. Fred has done it again. If you are FRED Fan, I would recommend this CD. It is off the hook 
This is a good CD. I really like Simply Put, Thank You, and No Greater Love. Simply Put describes how our love for God should be. It doesn't take all of the show that some of these churches put on every Sunday. We are to love God and God loves us unconditionally. I love Thank you, I won't complain, I am going through something also and it was comforting to know that God has been there all the time. 
As an eighties child myself, Killing Moon, Bedbugs and Ballyhoo along with a few others have a very special place in my heart. So I thought I'd venture out a little and see if there was anything else I overlooked from their era. NOPE. I had not, and this was a waste of money. 
This might be the finest album ever to be created. Every song is of high quality but they all work so well as a whole. When I first heard side one of this lp, I said to myself, this is one of the best album sides I have ever heard, and then I flipped it over. Good God Man! Sell the house, sell the kids, and go buy it NOW! You'll treasure it forevermore 
this album is wonderful. while i have some of their earlier albums, this starts to turn to epic post punk. kind of like and alternate universe of the chameleons. the song ocean rain is so great every time i play it for friends they just go "whoa" and kind of stop for a second. check out the hollow men "cresta", though totally different (not goth at all!), more like chapterhouse/happy monday chiming guitar pop. it's here for like 75 cents, it's sad 
At live shows from the time of Ocean Rain's release, singer Ian McCulloch introduced tracks as being from the "best album ever made, by the best band in the world." McCulloch's unremitting ego might be one reason the band never got the recognition they deserved, but his audacious statement about this album was at least partially right. From start to finish, Ocean Rain is stunning, of the same caliber as the greatest works by that other band from Liverpool. The last four songs (side 2 of the original LP, now tracks 6-9) have been justly referred to as the greatest LP side ever. Stop reading and buy this album. If you already own it, buy another copy for someone you love 
For me, this is by far the best Echo The Bunnymen album. The songwriting and musicianship displayed throughout are far better than anything they did before or since. Their other records are good, but this one is better than almost anything out of England in the 80's (including The Smiths, PiL, Roxy Music, etc.). I have well over 1000 CD's and this one is in the top 25. In twenty years I've never gotten tired of it. The "Side 2" song cycle of "The Killing Moon", "Seven Seas", "My Kingdom" and "Ocean Rain" is perfect. The 5 track "Life At Brian's" EP that follows the original album tracks has never been available on CD prior to this release and should be considered a "must have" for fans. The sound quality on the remastered version is so much better than the original CD it's worth spending the money to replace your old one too 
21 years after its release "Ocean Rain"still retains the magical aura that made it so special. Mac's surreal lyrics were here at their poetic best and were accordingly backed by Will Sargent's best and most varied perfomance to date. The album was by 84 their most acoustic set of songs but it was also their best for it showcased both the dark/moody songs at which they excelled and some more upbeat tunes(Seven Seas)making it their better balanced effort. The album contains absolutely no filler and is a remarkably thrilling affair from start to finish,a classic in truest sense of the word 
Yes, this was in many ways a classic 1980's 'new wave' type band. The name and Ian's hairdo certainly were of the time period. But this album truly stands the test of time and contains some of the best songs the band ever wrote, sterling production, and now the reissue makes available some very interesting material that has long been out of print. "Ocean Rain" finds Ian, Will, Les and Pete in full command of their craft, offering one excellent guitar-based piece after another, most with elegant, understated enhancement courtesy of hired symhony musicians. These songs could have been recorded using just acoustic guitars, and the album would still be fantastic. The outstanding production simply enhances what are already outstanding songs. I could rave about the individual songs, but why bother? The album is great, start to finish. I will comment a bit on the bonus material: "Angels Devils" was always my favorite b-side from these guys. Although it's quite simplistic in that it only has two parts, verse and chorus, each consisting of only two chords, the lyrics and the arrangement keep it engaging throughout. The five acoustic cuts come from a special "Seven Seas" ep. They are quite enjoyable, although I don't think any of these versions surpasses the original. As a matter of fact, I gotta admit that Ian's voice sounds pretty bad on the acoustic version of "Silver." The two live cuts are awesome. However, as is often the case with live recordings, the sound is not as full and rich as the studio versions. I happen to love a good live version, so I am keen on these, but again, I don't think either one of these tops the studio version. This album, along with Crocodiles, represents the peak of this band's creative achievement, and one of the best releases of the 1980's. And this reissue is great for bringing back some long out-of-print material 
This album was the Bunnymen's 4th, following Porcupine. After owning and listening to their first three over and over, I found only two songs on "Ocean Rain" up to their previous high level- "Crystal Days" and "Seven Seas". For some reason, the Bunnymen got away from their incredible guitar/drum driven sound into lush keyboards and strings which felt out of character for them. Their fresh use of strings in "Never Stop" on the previous LP totally rocked. They lost something here in this record, became overblown, too full of themselves, or something, which is why I think they took a 3 yr. break before their next LP (Self-Titled), which was viewed at the time as a bit of a comeback, because I think there was some kind of split after "Ocean Rain". This is a great band, with incredible lyrics and guitar playing, and their first 3 albums will richly let you in on this 
Kanno Yoko (or Yoko Kanno) is an amazing musician. The music she has created for "Macross Plus," "Cowboy Bebop," and Otomo's "Memories" is nothing short of incredible with its eclectic mix of genres, transcending all the limitations of those styles of music, bringing them all together into a cohesive sound that is different yet it all makes sense. Her music for "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex" is no different. Running the gamut from atmospheric vocals to hard rock to classical beauty, there is no ground uncovered, no stone unturned, but it's just so good to listen to. Strongly reminiscent of "Macross Plus" not thematically, but rather in the range of eclecticism and the choice of vocalists. The tracks "Stamina Rose" (my favorite) and "Fish 'n' Silent Cruise" bear a striking resemblance to "A Sai En" from "Macross Plus," but without sounding rehashed or copied. Other greats are "Run Rabbit Junk," "Where Does the Ocean Go?" and "Beauty Is Within Us." Just a great collection of music for both fans of the anime and fans of music in general. This is not to be missed...if you can find it, I strongly recommend that you get it. I think and feel you won't be disappointed 
This is the very best hillbilly music I have ever heard. It's heartfelt, unpretentious, raw, and rustic 
I love George Gershwin tunes. But, after listening to the first cut on disk one entitled "Prelude No.2 For Piano," my first thought was: "You've got to be kidding, couldn't the engineers have reduced the "hiss" noise from this great collection." Unfortunately, the problem was with my equipment. Once corrected, this CD was well worth the money spent. My vote goes from two stars to Five Stars 
I never knew who Gershwin was until I saw the 7th Heaven episode where they did a tribute to his music. I thought the music was interesting, so I decided to try a cd. I heard Rhapsody in Blue when I was a child.(the second half) I am always looking for a great artist and someone I feel is deserving of listening to. I'm proud to say that after I bought this album and listened to it, I am truely a Gershwin fan. And with me getting married soon, this was the best time to get introduced to his music because Embraceable You is definitely the most perfect song ever. 
Perlude #2 of Gershwin's "Three Preludes" is my all time favorite piece of music, and this wonderful cd presents it in a warm and loving way, as I think George Gershwin would have 
Absolutely great album! Wonderful Gershwin would be enough but add all the greats in music and vocal categories and it's a smash hit, one after another. It is definatley a journey down memory lane, well worth the purchase. I will play this many times over, timeless! 
I think the first place I heard a Gershwin piece was in a Tom Jerry cartoon as a kid (the episode where Jerry leaves for the big city only, lives the highs and lows and then returns before Tom wakes up from his cat nap). I loved the music in that episode but didn't know who had composed it until recently.  After receiving this album as a gift I have to say that I am very pleased with it and will continue to explore more Gershwin. Although I tend to like 'albums' per se... or set complete pieces, I think that this double album does a good job of introducing the listener to the range of Gershwin. Incredible. So many songs!!!... and performed by the people who made them (once) famous- Fred Astaire, Al Jolson, a young Sinatra. I imagine that Jane Russell's rendition of "Do It Again" was a pretty adult oriented piece for the time... even today it made my blush a bit. I would recommend this album to anyone who is interested in both a beginning look at the history of American music, and a taste of what Gershwin has to offer. I don't give it 5 stars because I think that this isn't the pinacle of the Gershwin stuff out there.... but still a great beginner for 'greatest hits' type listening and easy to enjoy 
According to the liner notes: "George Gershwin produced melodies the way an apple tree bears fruit -- naturally, prolifically, inevitably." True enough, if he lived a lot longer, he would undeniably be the most prolific composer of all-time and would have created a lot more lovely and remarkable melodies. I considered him the most brilliant composer America ever produced. In my heart, his music will linger on forever! It has that unbelievable charm and there's something about the melodies as well as the lyrics. Thanks to the brilliant mind of George and the creative talent of Ira in writing the lyrics, we can appreciate and enjoy the finest music we'll ever know in our lifetime. This is the kind of music my late parents loved listening to and I was greatly influenced by them. I have loved the music of the Gershwin Brothers as far back as I could remember! Imagine a grade-schooler loving this kind of music then? Just because I've been hearing them played over and over in our turntable and eventually learned to appreciate and enjoy them! This 2-CD Set features superb performances of Goodman, Sinatra, Bennett, Fitzgerald, Clooney, Astaire, Day, Torme, Feinstein, among many others. On Disc One, the tracks I enjoyed the most are Fred Astaire's "They Can't Take That Away From Me" which was originally recorded in the '30s from the movie "Shall We Dance?" a haunting rendition of "Someone To Watch Over Me" by Frank Sinatra, arranged by Axel Stordahl and was recorded in the '40s, a duet by Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark's "'S Wonderful," Gene Kelly's mellow rendition of "Our Love Is Here To Stay," the last song ever composed before Mr. Gershwin was hospitalized; and "How Long Has This Been Going On" by Felicia Sanders. Two legendary songbirds of all-time, Rosemary Clooney and Doris Day covering two of the best tracks, "A Foggy Day" and "But Not For Me," respectively. The very highlight on Disc Two is the ultimate piece of classic in the modern era, "Rhapsody In Blue" a masterpiece performed by the great composer himself, Mr. George Gershwin. Other noteworthy tracks are Ella Fitzgerald's "I've Got A Crush On You" and Maureen McGovern's heartfelt performance in a medley of "Love Walked In/Embraceable You" with its enchanting piano back up. Tony Bennett's singing "Who Cares?" is so fabulous with its forceful piano intro! "...He's not concerned with stocks and bonds he'd been burned with.... Who cares?.... Love's the only thing that matters..." Accompanying him in this wonderful performance is the Ralph Sharon Trio. This is one of the best tracks on the second CD. This is definitely a must-have not only for all Gershwin enthusiasts but also for "would-be" Gershwin fans! It's certainly a keeper. 
How's this for a first? The first album in the "Essential" series consisting of various artists. Of the 41 tracks on this double-album only two of them were performed by Gershwin himself and one of them , the almost-fourteen minute "Rhapsody In Blue" was partially recorded some forty years after his death. The performers on this compilation read like a who's who of artists inspired by Gershwin's brilliant compositions. Singers like Billy Holiday have two tracks here as well as Tony Bennett, Fred Astaire and Andre Kostelanetz and His Orchestra. Georges Guetary has a song "I'll Build A Stairway To Paradise" which he performed in the 1951 film "An American In Paris". Oscar Levant also performed "Third Movement" in that same film though it had been recorded years earlier. Finally, Michael Feinstein who co-produced this album has a beautifully performed rendition of "Home Blues" which closes the second disc. There's an insightful essay by Tim Page and one by songwriter Diane Warren about the legacy he left behind. Although he passed away on 7/11/37 of a brain tumor at age 38 he left behind a huge body of work that continues to inspire today's musicians. This album can truly attest to that

This is a CD that will last the test of time. I bought this years ago and someone took it!!! I am now listening to it again, and it makes my spirit leap with joy. I truly LOVE this CD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!! 
This is one of my most favorite Commissioned albums ever. Reason being is because Fred and Marvin are great singers and this was the last project they had together before their solo careers really took flight. I love this album, "Dare to Believe" is a classic. "I'm Learning" is one of my all-time favorites. "Love Is The Way" and "Come Home" are two blazing, bumping tracks that will get you bobbing your head. Then the album goes urban praise and worship on the last few tracks which is uplifting and spiritual. "Draw Me Nearer" is, vocally, Commissioned at its best. Another one to add to the collection 
Another one of Commissioned's masterpieces. My husband and I love this CD, and are usually fighting over who gets to listen to it. My husband's favorite song is "I'm Learning". One of my favorite songs (and I have a whole lot of them) is "We Shall Behold Him". Of Course it talks about the Rapture, and meeting the Saviour in the air. I am anticipating for His return! Just to see Him face to face would be so awesome! 
This was my very first Barry album. For many many years, I knew little about his music, just a few songs I liked. Since I had a 6-CD changer in my car, Barry got a slot. He sat there with Andy Williams, Mannheim Steamrollers, and a few others. I played a few select songs on the album now and then, or let the whole album play when its turn came up. I don't know where my head was, because this is a great CD. It just took me a little longer than many to appreciate the magic of Manilow. All the songs are his classics and are all great versions--20 tracks in total. If you don't have any/much Barry, this is a good CD to have. Basic Barry, for a little less than the cost of a large Starbucks and a bagel :- 
Unabashedly romantic and sentimental, Barry Manilow has always filled the need for uplifting pop music. Taking the lead from other famous crooners, his pop sensibility brought heartwarming smiles throughout the seventies. 'Ultimate Manilow' makes the rest of his collections obsolete. (Although notice how quickly his 'Best Songs of the Fifties' hit the top of the charts "even now".) It must be conceded that his voice is a mixed blessing. It is engaging and reverent to the subject matter, but while many of his songs soar with the orchestration, on the biggest notes his voice falters. Nevertheless, the songs are great. He particularly arises to the occasion on such classics as "Mandy," "Weekend in New England," and "Somewhere in the Night". Although the most progressive numbers of his songlist are the best, including "It's a Miracle," "Daybreak," and the big band jazzy "Bandstand Boogie". Not for the cynical, Manilow can break the ice with heartfelt classics, like "Tryin' to Get the Feeling," and "Can't Smile Without You". Not all of it is great, however. "This One's for You" and "Copacabana (At the Copa) demonstrate banality, even if the latter edges out with some winning entertainment. The less familiar material near the end are welcome additions to his familiar repertoire. For those of us who don't mind conventional popular music, Barry Manilow fits the bill with an uplifting, traditional catalog of music that has aged well with the production. Who else since Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, or Dean Martin has managed to keep crooner pop classics going past the sixties? 
Jerry McCulley wrote this about Mr. Manilow...."It's tempting to say that about Barry Manilow, an artist whose stubborn, quarter-century dedication to old-fashioned song craft and musical melodrama has earned him few critical praises but a loyal worldwide following in the millions. When a cult of 20-something would-be lounge lizards tried to cash in on Manilow's shtick in the 1990s, they distanced themselves from its emotional potency with telling dollops of irony and retro-hip cynicism--anything to keep from looking too sincere." I love that quote. I have always adored Manilow's music, never liking it from a so-called "ironic" standpoint. This is great baroque pop music, a lot of which Manilow wrote himself. This stuff works as well as it does because Manilow is SO sincere, so real, so passionate. I don't feel ashamed at all for liking this (I dig bubblegum music, which Barry's music has similarities, but his is much more resonant). This CD is all you really need in terms of greatest hits. The 4 CD box set has mostly outtakes and alternative takes, which are nowhere near as good as the final products. This set is must cheaper, and there's nothing superfluous on this CD. I love this stuff, and not from a Generation X, "ironic", standpoint. 
I was thrilled with this cd. It had all of my favorite songs from when I was young. Defiantely brought some wonderful memories back. Even my husband loved it 
Baby boomers get accustomed to listening the songs of Micheal Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, Brian McKnight, R. Kelly, and Usher to date. Just a copy of this title of Manilow could still be recommended for the beginner of the romantic ballad category. The song, CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU, will have gone quite for your own proposal to a girl you want. As to me, guess what ? 
I've never considered myself a Barry Manilow fan, but decided after seeing him on American Idol the other night I would give his new album a try and picked this one up at the same time. I'm so glad I did...I enjoy this one so much more! Maybe it's nostalgia, but I'm enjoying it. Have to highly recommend it to everyone, young, old and in-between 
This CD is worth every penny. All his most beloved classics in one awesome listening experience. I highly recommend it!! 
A must have for any Barry Manilow fan! Makes you turn up the volume and sign your heart out 
This is truly the ultimate collection of Barry Manilow songs. It has all of his very best songs and makes a great companion for long drives and short hops. It's impossible not to sing along with Mandy, It's a Miracle, Looks Like We Made It and his other greatest hits. And for those who like Manilow and who also like close harmony, maybe I'll see you when his show, The Comedian Harmonists, opens on Broadway 
i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
The CD contains a little bit of everything, but all songs familiar to my daughter 
My 3 year old requests to listen to this CD over and over again! It is fantastic since I know the words to all the songs too. I love singing and dancing around the house with my son to this CD. It is much better than laying around the house and watching another movie. What was even better was listening to this CD on our last road trip. I never heard a peep out of him except his singing! It is a MUST HAVE! 
As soon as we tell my daughter that we are going bye-bye, she asks if we could listen to Elmo (aka this CD. At 20 months she was singing along! It has all the great children's songs I remember. It has become one of our favorites from Sesame Street 
I was waiting in anticipation for this cd to arrive and was not disapointed. Etta is the bes 
Loved the CD . Hard to believe that Etta James was a teenager when she recorded these songs. Her voice is flawless. I am a new fan 
What an amazing collection of songs, sung with richness and clarity by one of the most distingushable voices. I used "At Last" at my recent wedding and the title song was what played as I walked down the aisle to meet my husband. Everyone complimented my choice of music. The rest of the cd played at our reception and everybody just loved it 
Turns out I purchased this cd for one song. I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd. The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd 
At last is still one of the finest recordings ever! Chilling vocals that get under your skin and stay there. Etta at her best 
I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THESE TWO LADIES BECAUSE OF ONE RECORD. THEY BOTH SANG IT WITH DIFFERENT STYLES, BUT THE SONG IS THE EPITOME OF LOVE NO MATTER HOW AND WHO SINGS IT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE TIME AT WHICH THEY WERE MADE. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY LUCK WHEN AMAZON SAID THEY HAD BOTH 
I remembered when I first heard Etta James. The song "Sunday Kind of Love," came up in one of the scenes in the film "Eve's Bayou," which was released in theaters in 1997, and ever since then she has caught my attention. This remastered re-release of her classic 1961 album is really stunning. It was also one of the most successful R *albums* up to that point (this came out well before the "album rock" era). She never achieved the crossover success of Aretha Franklin or Tina Turner, but if any female soul singer deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those two, it's definitely Etta James. She had several hits from this, in addition to the legendary title song. "Anything to Say You're Mine," "My Dearest Darling," "Trust in Me," and "All I Could Do Was Cry" is all the cream of the crop of early soul music. She puts her spin on a couple of gritty Chicago blues numbers ("I Just Want to Make Love to You" and "Spoonful," the latter being one of four duets with Harvey Fuqua of the Moon glows that are included here), as well as the jazz standards "Stormy Weather," "At Last," and "Sunday Kind of Love," which are my favorite. She really showcases her virtuosity, and it works surprisingly well. Etta James never reached these heights again but came really close though. Her voice has traveled for many years to touch the ears and lives of today's listeners, and she will remain to do so for many years to come. 
It's amazing to think Etta James was just in her teens when these tracks were cut. The vocals on this collection of songs range from sassy to tender to broken-hearted to playful. Truly an incredibly gifted vocalist, and a great selection of tunes. The title track, often used in commercials and movies (perhaps a little too often), is one of the greatest love songs of all time and only hints at the variety herein. Get "At Last." Play it at your cocktial parties, during romantic dinners or on a rainy, lazy Sunday morning at home. It delights, it thrills, and it is an all time classic 
I once was the proud owner of Etta James vinyl LP: "Etta James' Top Ten". So, when I saw this CD at my local record store and noticed it had several of the tracks I loved in the vinyl LP form...I bought it! Man, Etta has a way with phrasing! Etta has that tear in her voice on chestnuts like "At Last", "Trust In ME" and "My Dearest Darling". The track not included on this CD that was on the Top Ten album, "Pushover" was a gem. But here are included 2 awesome duets with Harvey Fuqua (formerly of The Moonglows) "Spoonful" and "If I Can't Have You". On both of these tunes Harvey and Etta compliment each other's unique vocalizing. "Sunday Kind Of Love" and "Stormy Weather" are classics! As a matter of fact......as R singers go...Etta James is the only one who comes close to Aretha Franklin's claim to "Queen of Soul"! 
Etta James has mastered the perfect blend of sophistication and soul. Her ear for the 'just right' arrangements and production, (which might normally be credited to her producers and arrangers), has been consistent throughout all of her various producers and arrangers, and so, must be credited to her. Nowadays, a lot of amateurish backing tracks are accepted under the 'down-home' banner, so here's a tip: Listen to all that other stuff first, because after Etta, it just sounds like underachieving. 
Since "Blue Sky on Mars," I lost track of what Matthew Sweet was putting out. I still love "100% Fun." It is one of my favorite albums but, since "Blue Sky" wasn't quite as good, I lost interest. Well, running across reviews for "Kimi Ga Suki * Raifu," my interest in Sweet piqued once again. Boy, I'm glad I didn't miss this album! It is incredible! The liner notes explain that Sweet wrote all the tracks over a one-week period and recorded them without any demos. Well, I guess that was a recipe for success. The proof is in the pudding! The album is a gift to his Japanese fans (Sweet calls it a "love letter to Japan") and was originally not released in the United States. It is worth owning as an import for the higher price but, I'm glad it is available here. "Dead Smile"(3:01): Cute little opening rocker, but better tracks are to come including 3 slam-dunks in a row! "Morning Song" (2:37): Man, this is way too short! One of my favorite tracks on this album. Pleasant, kickback feel. "The Ocean In-Between" (2:49): Wow, what a beautiful rocker! Definitely a tribute to his Japanese fans. The chorus is wonderful with the sweetest lyrics! "I Love You" (4:39): Awesome rocker! Grabs you right away! The chorus is amazing! You WILL be addicted to this track! "I Don't Want to Know" (2:29): OK, we got the 3 slam dunks out of the way (there are 3 more to come). This is a nice, pleasant, soft, yet upbeat, track. "Warning" (2:53): I actually did not like this song at first. I thought its opening was weak, but it gets better with each listen. "Spiral" (1:51): Now we're talking! But why do such awesome tracks have to be so short!? I want MORE of this! Dark, furtive-sounding, undertones with excellent background guitar! "Love is Gone" (3:28): Slow and quiet number. "Hear This" (3:22): Slam dunk time again! The awesome verses kick! In fact, the chorus is almost a let-down. It is a little country-sounding but not enough to detract. "Wait" (2:39): OK, not a slam dunk, but still another pleasant track with soft vocals. "Tonight We Ride" (2:45): Now, this IS a slam dunk! Flat out rocks from beginning to end! Great guitar, awesome chorus! Best track here! "Through Your Eyes" (5:10): I can see why this is the final track as it has that feel to it. It is a nice, catchy song. At the 3:56 mark, it bursts into a guitar/drum instrumental and then peters out to end the domestic record. "Silent Track 1" (1:50): I actually ordered the unenhanced domestic version, but received the enhanced one anyway. If you are wondering if the extra track is worth possibly paying additional money for the enhanced version, it is silence at first and then Sweet sings "Sayoonara --I will see you some time soon." I would say it is only for completests 
This is Matthew Sweet's best album. Just straight-forward rock/pop. Raw, but melodic tunes with heft and heart. He cranked this thing out in just a couple weeks, so he didn't have time to second-guess himself and slave over the production. So what you're left with is an honest and heartfelt album that's not fussed-over 
In reading Mr Lavezzoli's excellent review, where he says almost everything, I find he has said almost everything I wanted to say. I found this album and I was put off by the jacket. Sweet has a huge loyal fan bass in Japan which has followed him from "Girlfriend", a Zeitgeist album, one of, if not the best album of the last twenty years, past 'Altered Beast", "100% Fun" and through the sinking ship of the subsequent albums. He as here as he has always a lyric yet mordant writing gift, a great harmonies, jangly Byrds style guitars. There was a dispute of some sort following his early stuff and his band parted ways. He wonderful backup band for Girlfriend, deserved a lot more credit Richard Lloyd, Ric Menck, Greg Leisz, but most specifically Lloyd whose masterful acidic guitar licks played off against Sweets softer lyric tendency. What he has lacked in recent years is Lloyd. Sweet is a writer/singer capable of both power and sensitivity. Great harmonies, missing from so much new Rock. New songs (for a live album). His Janapese fan base worships his every note. A famous Japanese artist did the cover as a tribute (famous to the Japanese): the cat is symbolic of Sweet, the Girl Japan! It certainly appeals more to them and Sweet than to me, I guess, but ignore the outside and get inside. This is the power, energy and spontanaeity of "Girlfriend", altho search as I may, there is not a standout cut like "Divine Intervention". Which is why I give it a 4 star rating rather than 5 under my tough grading system. This album is obscure, you will have to seek it out, I found only one copy in the largest store in town. Your search will be rewarded. Let's hope Sweets future efforts include Mr Lloyd and the rest of the crew follow this live format rather than the recent syrupy, overproduced, under-guitared albums. 
Matthew Sweet made his indelible mark on the music world with albums that resonate with Pop, Rock, and a sense of fun. Girlfriend and the aptly titled 100% Fun are two such examples of the musical legacy he has left in his wake. Recent releases have not lived up to such lofty standards but have been decent nonetheless. Kimi Ga Suki, a fan "Thank You" cd for the devoted SweetHeads in Japan, is a semi-return to form. Fun, energetic, spontaneous...none of the baggage that or writing-by-numbers performances that drag down some other releases. You are not going to find songs that will define the decade for you as some of his earlier work has for me (can't hear Divine Intervention without opening a time-capsule of memories from a distant era gone by) but you will find an enjoyable listen from start to finish. Buy this album. Enjoy this album for what it is...a thank you note from a pretty cool guy 
So, I'm ripping my CDs recently and rediscover my Matthew Sweet collection from the early nineties. I thought to myself, "what's he up to now?" So, I discover this "Japan-only" gem a few years late and was STUNNED! This takes you right back to 1991-1995 era Matthew Sweet. I seriously redeveloped my appreciation for Matthew Sweet's acute talents with this one 
Kimi Ga Suki Raifu is really a fascinating item in the Matthew Sweet canon. Originally recorded solely for the Japanese fan base, and initially released only in that country, this album was simply too good to keep from the rest of the world! This may well be Sweet's most consistently powerful and EXCITING album, with special emphasis on the word "excitement." It's even more energetic than Girlfriend or 100% Fun, both of which have at least a couple of low spots, but there is nothing but brilliance here. This is what happens when a great musician places himself into a "pressure cooker" situation, writing and recording an entire album of material in one week. No demos, no excessive overdubs, no second guessing. Matthew brought together his old rock roll cohorts: Richard Lloyd, Ric Menck, Greg Leisz, for a reunion of the original Girlfriend lineup. Without giving himself the luxury of making demos and reworking these songs, Sweet set himself the challenge of writing and recording 12 songs in one fell swoop, and he came up aces! All of Matthew's natural gifts are on full display here: passionate hard driving rock and roll, stripped to its raw essence (but still with gorgeous vocal harmonies), with Sweet's acerbic wit in high gear. This is probably his most consistent set of lyrics on one record. His sharp irony and twisted sense of humor in matters of love and heartache is in full effect. No other songwriter can take a love song and make it so sad or angry, and yet so...outrageously funny at the same time, from the title track of "Girlfriend" to "I Almost Forgot" to every song on this record. Picture the romantically jaded Neil Young mixed with the dark humor of Peter Gabriel, and Matthew sits somewhere in that realm. He can make me cry or roar with laughter in the same song, and believe me, that is a RARE gift for a lyricist. The band is rock solid and as tight as can be. Matthew plays typically great bass on the album, and Menck punctuates with power and intelligence on the drums. Of course, Lloyd's guitar solos are completely demented! Some reviewers have said that this album is under-produced, but I feel the opposite. It was meant to be a stripped down, bare bones rock album, and it was produced exactly as it should be. Concise and cohesive. Sometimes a rock and roll song doesn't need a guitar solo or a synthesizer. Sometimes all it needs is a driving groove, and the quality of the writing takes care of the rest. If there are good lyrics and catchy hooks, the song plays itself. No frills needed. And besides, Sweet's vocal harmonies are overdubbed to perfection here as with his other albums, so the production is spot on as far as I'm concerned. Anything more would have detracted from the visceral power and wit of these songs. Highlights are hard to specify, but Morning Song, I Love You (a scorcher!), and Wait are three of my personal favorites. But again, there is not one single piece of filler on this album, a stunning achievement for a set of tunes written and hammered out in one week. On a sadder note, I must say that his recent album, Living Things, is such a terrible disappointment compared to this album. It's a sloppy, overproduced, poorly written record that is actually quite depressing and possibly qualifies as Matthew Sweet's worst album (in my opinion). Fortunately, the immediacy and sheer brilliance of Kimi Ga Suki Raifu proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that when Matthew Sweet makes up his mind to rock, he can produce an album of stunning power and personality like this one. This CD should be in every rock collection, and certainly no one who appreciates Matthew Sweet should be without it. 
It's nice to hear Matthew Sweet return to exciting powerpop again after two lackluster albums. All is right in the universe when I hear songs like Dead Smile and Hear This. The lush harmony style and wicked guitar of the master and his friends is evident throughout. Kimi Ga Suki Raifu ranks after Altered Beast and 100% Fun but before Girlfriend and the others. [DW] 
It's great to see the "Girfriend" era band members back together for this phenominal album. "The Ocean In Between" has got to be one of the greatest, catchy, and hook filled power pop songs of all time. On of my all time favorite Matthew Sweet songs. Matthew, keep 'em coming!!! 
This album is on a par with 100% Fun as Sweet's best. You have to ask why this wasn't the official global CD release instead of the bland 2 star Living Things. Where that album plods into twee plonky territory every other song, Kimi Ga Suki soars and dives with passion and verve, aided by the edgey guitar attack of Richard Lloyd and Sweet's Girlfriend cohorts, an album this one actually betters. If record companies knew what they were doing, this album would put Sweet back on the map and in your record collection. But unfortunately they don't 
What a good artistic year Matthew Sweet is having. First the U.S. was treated to a lovely new CD, Living Things, that returned him to the power and acuity of Girlfriend. Now a work he originally created for his Japanese fan club only, Kimi Ga Suki, is available stateside, and it's even better (by a hair) than Living Things. There's a looseness to these 12 tracks missing from the official release -- a result of having set himself paramaters and recording quickly. Still, the deadlines worked in his favor. Sweet's gorgeous power pop is a confection, best served fast and fresh. Nuggets here include the aching "Love Is Gone" and the Mach V opener "Dead Smile". If only FM radio would pick up on his singular talent once again 
Everyone is going to complain and disagree with that statement, but I feel its true. Okay okay, Do you want more?!?! is just as tight. Things falling apart is tight, but not as tight as The Tipping point. Illadelph Half life is all right, I didn't enjoy it as much as The Tipping point. Organix is tight as well, but the Tipping point is the joint! Phrenology was good, experimental in some areas and conventional in others. The Tipping point is aggressive, beautiful, tight, soft, hard, fast, slow and real all at the same time. It doesn't compare to their live album, but I did say best "studio" album. I love this album. This is the Roots at the top of their game. ?uestlove's drum beats are the illest on this album, and Black Thought's rhymes flow like water or butter. A must have for all Roots fans and all hip hop heads. This is one hip hop masterpiece instant classi 
Buy it for song #9, "Web". I think the whole almun is great, so I don't know what kinda [...] the rest of y'all call good hip-hop. I just need to say that "Web" embodies what the Roots are. ?uestlove layin' down a sick beat in the back on some real drums, not overproduced Paul Wall/Mike Jones/ Swisha House [...]!. Then, you got Thought puttin the lyrical slaughter to all the rest! Prolly the best hip-hop song I've ever heard. How hip-hop was meant to be. 
This cd is dope. Black Thought is the truth. He is the perfect blend of consciousness and swagger in an emcee. At only 10 tracks long, this cd is short in length, but what it lacks in duration it makes up for in lyricism. In my opinion, Don't Say Nuthin is a genius single. The song casually makes fun of rap songs that lack substance while the hook is literally Black Thought mumbling a bunch of words together. Although it sounds contradictory, my interpretation of the song is to say that a lot of rap songs now days don't have any genuine meaning in them and that record labels promote this kind of music. Thought kills the final verse, and I love the eerie beat that accompanies the song. Other highlights include: the reggae influenced "Guns Are Drawn", the smooth and laid back "Somebody's Gotta Do It" (which features an interesting collaboration with Devin the Dude), and the socially conscious "Why"-a track guaranteed to make you think. Overall this is not the roots best cd, but I feel at times Thought is at his best here. Don't hit the snooze button again if you've been sleeping on The Roots, pick up this cd. 
The best part of this album are the hidden tracks. Seriously. They are cool. Whoever says that the Roots stopped having fun and playing instruments and experimenting should listen to this album past track 10 and hear the fun BlackThought and ?uest have on the bonus jam. Overall, this is a tight album full of beats and hooks that will appeal to folks who enjoy more mainstream hiphop. For people wanting to hear the Roots push the genre a bit, you might find yourself annoyed by some of the sing-song choruses 
Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as they are very similar and all good friends as seen on Dave Chapelles Block Party. and if you in cali be sure to catch Dead Prez in their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!!

I have to give these guys 5 stars. By the way, I saw the roots live? OMG!. I'm not a real big hip hop fan, but I was blown away by the performance. Let me try and explan what they did on stage..They came out and capture the audience with hard beats of neosoul, head bobing, body swaying type stuff. Then just when they had that young audience in thier hands, they hit em-up with some beebop jazz/funk..and get this..the young crowd didn't even realize that they were feeling clasic jazz. Ok, so now they go back to that abstract signature sound. It's obvious that these guys are very spiritual. I would say.. best live performance in hip hop!! 
I've been a fan of the Roots since Organix. Do You Want More?!!!? is still my favorite album. But they brought it so hard on this album that it made me want to be a better person. 
This was the first album that I bought by The Roots, when it came out summer '04. I have to say this is a good album, compared to the other albums that I heard lately. The reason I gave this album 4 stars is because I bought "Do You Want More?!!??!!!" and "Illidelph Halflife" and those albums blew me away and "The Tipping Point" is just a tad bit short of the two. The stand out tracks are: Star/Pontro Stay Cool Duck Down Somebody's Gotta Do It Boom Dip Bap (The second unlisted bonus track) Nice album for The Roots, and it is something if you want to get into if you love jazzy hip ho 
How dare you other reviewers give this cd less than 5 stars. It gets six. If you like hip-hop and think that Fifty Cent sucks and Kanye West is way over-rated then buy this. This is real hip-hop. Black Thought's lyrics are on point--the tipping point. You can play this album through and through. Hip-hop classic! (...) If you've slept on Roots Manuva get all three of his albums now--and thank me later 
Now I've been a Roots fan for a while now, and before this week, I had every Roots album besides 'The Tipping Point' (yes, I even own 'Organix'). I hadn't really heard many good things about it, and was going to pick it up eventually, but it wasn't a priority. When I was at the CD store to buy the new Smif N Wessun album, I saw this CD sitting on the used shelf for only about $7.99, and I realized that under the used wrapping, it was brand new (factory sealed and all). So, I decided to buy it too (along with the 'He Got Game Soundtrack' used for only about $5.99), not with very high expectations. After listening to it 3 times, I can safely say it's definately up to par with all of the Roots other work. For this album, the main criticism is that "the beats are too bland and boring". Although I don't think the beats are lacking at all, I think that The Roots made the beats a little more simplistic, so the album could center around Black Thought a bit more. I actually think this is a good thing, because Black Thought is one of my favorite MC's in the game, and one of the best of all time, and he truly shines on this album. The production on the album is handled by The Roots, and affiliates, like all of their other albums. ?uestlove ('Star', 'Guns Are Drawn' 'I Don't Care'), Anthony Tidd, Frank "Knuckles" Walker, Richard Nichols ('Guns Are Drawn' 'I Don't Care'), Scott Storch ('Don't Say Nuthin' 'Duck Down'), Melvin 'Chaos' Lewis ('Stay Cool' 'Boom!'), Robert 'LB' Dorsey ('Web'), Tahir Jamal ('Somebody's Gotta Do It'), Zoukhan ('Why? (What's Goin' On?) all provide pretty much dope beats. As for the album lyrically, its top notch. As I said, Black Thought drops hot verses throughout the entire album, that are good enough basically to carry the album if the beats were really lacking. Top 5 Songs (In Order): 1. Star/Pointro - One of the smoothest rap songs I've ever heard, classic Roots production (with a great Sly The Family Stone sample) and Black Thought opens up the album with some of his best verses 2. Guns Are Drawn - Another that quickly became one of my favorite Roots songs. Love the beat here, and again one of Black Thought's highlights lyrically 3. Boom! - The best flow on the whole album, and as the Amazon Editorial Review said, it really does sound like a Kane or G Rap imitation. I even think he might have lifted a G Rap line: "Homonyms, synonyms good like M's"...Not sure but I think I recognize that from some G Rap Polo song 4. Why? (What's Goin On?) - Love the production here, and Black Thought slows it down a bit to make a GREAT song 5. I Don't Care - Love the drums and bass, also the catchiest hook on here (do I even have to mention that Black Thought spits fire again?) Worst Track: Duck Down! - The beat can get kinda annoying (its not BAD, but the worst on the CD). And Black Thought is decent on here...Just overall is an "OK" track Lyrics/Substance/Subject Matter - 9/10 Flow/Delivery - 9/10 Production - 8.5/10 Overall Feel - 9/10 Guest Apperances - 6/10 - Riq Gees, Jean Grae Mac - All on one song ('Somebody's Gotta Do It'), and the only one I'm actually a fan of is Jean Grae, but they all drop decent/pretty good verses. But, the song doesn't stand out, and they don't play an important role here at all. Overall Rating - 8.5/10 - Highly reccomended, and a must have for any fan of The Roots...This one surprised me, and just might surprise yo 
Simply put, this is a classic. The album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able'. Black Thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound. The guest appearances are great too. This is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are 
The Roots have, and always will be known, as one of the most underrated acts in hip hop music. Besides having two incredibly talented lyricists as their leaders: Black Thought, and Malik B, they still don't get the respect they rightfully deserve as being considered legends. Their musicanship abilities are above anybody else in rap due to the fact that they dont even create instrumentals with a synthesizer. Nope. The Roots are actually a live band, who records their beats live in the studio, then fine tunes them on the computers. They've created a very unique style of combining jazz elements into hip hop to produce a fresh new sound, as only they can provide. Since their onset, the Roots have continuously grown as better musicians and lyricists. They've experimented from every style you can think of. From soul, to even beat boxing, the more unorthodox style of hip hop music. Nobody can produce a record in the same fashion or on the same level as the Roots, and they prove on 1996's Illadelph Halflife that the first two albums were NOT a joke, and that they are indeed here to prove themselves.

This album holds the most weight in my CD collection. Specifically there are four songs for me that will never grow old or get boring they be: - Episodes which has a beautifal urban raw mystical feeling about it and stirs something inside no other hip hop song ever has. UNIverse at war featuring Common which is an amazingly powerful track. No great pretender - I would say the most accomplished song along with Episodes from black thought and finally the chilled Hypnotic, which is just pure brilliance. It still has some experimentalness about it but nothing compared to Organix. Its better produced than the previous album "Do you want more" which is a classic also. To cut a long story short, this album is powerful chilled jazzy hip hop at its finest by one of the smartest rap groups that ever existed. It lead me to admit the roots as my favourite hip hop group, you can't go wrong buying this album 
This is one of thee best hip hop albums ive ever heard. Up there with A Tribe Called Quests, Midnight Marauders, Dels 3030, Dr. Octagon so on and so forth. Today i bought 2 Tickets to go see, The Roots Live at Montreal Jazz Fest July 7th 2006, and ive never been so exited. There jazzy Hip Hopness is so addicting, especially in Illadelph Halflife, anyone worthy of calling themselves Heads, has got to own this album! Key Tracks include * Every single song on this album!!!!!!!!! Peac 
Black Thought and Malik B are at their best in this album. Their rap is smooth and innovative while the choruses are melodic and catchy. This album is right there with Do You Want More??!? in terms of song quality and jazz influence. Once you hear this album, you will be hooked on it for months 
There are so many great tracks on this CD. I just think this is one of the best roots albums, and one of the best hip-hop albums I've listened to. The tracks are very diverse and creative, musically innovative. There's so much to these songs. Some of them are very moving and deep. This is one of those albums that you want to listen to over and over again...not only is it good enough that it won't get boring, but you will keep picking up new shades of meaning 
i remember when the first time l listened to this album, i nearly fell asleep. but as i listen to it over and over again, it started to sound so smooth and nice.... i guess it just took me a while to get adapted to their way of rapping. (i'm not fan of their voice tone when they rap... 
Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as they are very similar and all good friends as seen on Dave Chapelles Block Party. and if you in cali be sure to catch Dead Prez in their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!!

If anyone gave this album less than 5 stars, you must not have been paying attention. This album is possibly one of the best albums that came out in the 90's. I love this album along with the Do You Want More ???!!!??! album. It's on point with the mind blowing productions, live vocals by Black Thought and Malik B, and Live (And self made) instruments By ?uestion and Rahzel. There is no one or two exceptional tracks on this CD, because every one stands out to its fullest. Kinda takes me back to the ATCQ CD "The Low End Theory" even though I was only 5 years old when it came out. I'm only going to name a few tracks that are my personal favorites despite that every track should be heard and not skipped: 6. Episodes 7. Push Up Ya Lighter 8. What They Do- I love this song. Something you can just lay back and chill and nod your head to with the help of Raphael Saadiq singing the hook. 10. Concerto Of The Desparado- Should wake you up from the ? Vs. Scratch track 11. Clones- The intermission between verses are awesome. Black Thought, Dice Raw, M.A.R.S., and Malik B murder this song. Classic! 12. U.N.I. Vs. At War- Common Sense and Black Thought come correct with this one 15. No Greater Protector- Another great laid back track like the "What They Do" song 18. One Shine- Damn! (Thats all I need to say) 19. The Adv. In Wonderland- Another poem by Ursela Rucker. I'm kinda mad that she's not on any of the latest Roots' albums. Bottom line: If you don't have this album, you don't know the elements of the hip hop generation 
THANK'S TO JIGGAJ...IT TOOK ME WHEN I WAS JUST COMING OUT OF THE COX AVE.REST ROOM!!!!!!!...I ASK HIM WHO IS THIS HE TOLD ME THA ROOTS!!!!!!!!

One of those songs is arguably the greatest of all American popular songs, ' Ole Man River'. This recording has versions of the songs Kern himself would probably approve of, as he did not particularly like jazzed-up versions of his work. The songs and performers are: Til the Clouds Roll By - Bing Crosby 2. They Didn't Believe Me - Dinah Shore, Morris Stoloff His Orchestra 3. Look for the Silver Lining - Connee Boswell, Victor Young His Orchestra 4. Who? - George Olsen His Orchestra 5. Bill - Helen Morgan, Victor Young 6. Make Believe - James Melton, Victor Young 7.

This collection of singles retains all of the charm and lyric sophistication of the other Postal Service work. We Will Become Silhouettes appears on two tracks. The original is ethereal and upbeat. Matthew Dear's Not Scared Mix takes it to the next level, making the happy song even catchier. Be Still My Heart will be a favorite of Such Great Heights fans. With story lyrics and happy back beat, the song is something to listen to when you need a pick-me-up. Nothing Better (Styrofoam Remix) launches straight into electronica. 
I didn't think I was missing much until I got this single, its as or more addictive than the album. Worth every penny just for "Be Still My Heart" and the remixes give the other tracks an incredibly fresh sound and feel. If you love Postal Service you will LOVE this single! Cheers 
A band like the Postal Service produces singles easily -- their trip-hop is fresh, sweet and wistful, as well as being wickedly catchy. And Ben Gibbard (Death Cab For Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborell (Dntel) were in top form in the wistful, lyrically weird "We Will Become Silhouettes."  A flowing, strange story-song, "We Will Become Silhouettes" tells what happens when for some reason, the air causes cells to "Divide at an alarming rate until our shells/Simply cannot hold all our insides in,/And that's when we'll explode/(and it won't be a pretty sight)." Interpret that as you will, but the apocalyptic whimsy of it is irresistable.  A new song follows it: "Be Still My Heart," an enchanting little ballad with rapid percussion overlaid with organ and synth. "Nothing Better (Styrofoam Remix)" is a fair remix that is off in some parts (what is with that fizzing noise?) but retains the plaintiveness as the original. And finally there is the laid-back "We Will Become Silhouettes (Matthew Dear's Not Scared Mix)," which is stripped-down and fragile-sounding.  "We Will Become Silhouettes" is a bit of an oddball song, on an album full of songs about loneliness and lost love. Lyrically, it sounds like one of the Flaming Lips' more mainstream songs. Not that that's a bad thing -- it adds a sense of strangeness and fun to Postal Service's debut. It certainly reflects in the cover, with a rather startled-looking young man surrounded by people who are fading away.  This single does a good job of also showing off the kinds of music that Postal Service can do -- the title song is poppy and smooth, while the second is sort of synthy-drummy. What is even better, the remixes are good. Most remixes cloud over what made the song good in the first place, but Postal Service's are well-done.  "We Will Become Silhouettes" is a solid single, especially with the well-done remixes and extra song. It'll probably leave you humming, "And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go..." 
They Got Lost is a collection of rarities. Meaning, a couple B-Sides, a hidden track on "Factory Showroom", and songs off out of print or hard to find albums. This isn't the most solid collection, but the music is great none the less. Rest Awhile is a hard rock song with catchy tunes and morbid lyrics. A Linnell masterpiece, need more be said? Truth In Your Words is pretty good music wise. The chorus is ok, and the verses are just boring. On The Drag is another catchy one. It's pretty good. A Flansburgh stereotype. Very monopuff-ish. All Alone is my least favorite on the album. I usually skip it. Down To The Bottom of The Sea is very cool, but too short. The synthesizer is pretty cool (possibly a Moog?), but this doesn't do much seeing how short it is. I'm Sick (Of This American Life) Is similar to Cyclops Rock lyrically, but the music is MUCH more laid back. It's acoustic too. I like it. Words Are Like is pretty boring. It's ok from time to time, but it's mostly a vocal song. I'm pretty sure it's sung with Flansburgh's wife, Robin "Goldie" Goldwasser (I think that's it). I Am A Human Head. My ABSOLUTE favorite song on this collection. I love it... a lot. Words cannot describe how I love it so (I know, I shouldn't love it this much.) Oranges: A testimonial for the Chopping Block web design company. I like the other version more. Empty Bottle Blues: As the name suggests, it's a blues song. It's also instrumental. It's pretty good. They Got Lost is a nice story, but it's tough to listen all the way through sometimes. There's a more upbeat version on Severe Tire Damage. It's pretty good though. Reprehensible is a weirder song, not that great, but it's ok. I like the music more than anything and it has a nice solo in the middle. Rat Patrol is a strangely vocaled song, but I like it a lot. Army's Tired Now has a nice and lengthy intro. Overall a great song. Certain People I Could Name is mellow and I love the instrumentation. Another great Linnell song. Theme To McSweeney's Sounds like the "Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade" With many synthesizers, it's fun and catchy. Reminds me of a demo tape my dad made of himself playing the Moog (Not sure if this is good or bad... meh.) Dollar For Dollar sounds kind of like the interlude of Paul McCartney's "Tug Of War" album, which is done with a vocoder. This track is interesting, but there's not much you can say about it. Mosh Mokem Abadon is a remake of an Arabic pop song. This is instrumental though. it's cool, but not too accessible. Token Back To Brooklyn is taken from "Factory Showroom". It's a hidden track that you can access by reversing the first track into negative time. Doesn't do much for me. Disappointing Show was done spontaneously live when (I think) nothing was working right, so they just did this or something... I don't know. It's humorous, and shows how well They Might Be Giants work together (And stay in the same key). The Oranges Testimonial is the poppier, better version of the Chopping Block song. For a fuller version, put the "NO!" album in your computer and view the credits. There you go. A run down of a pretty good album. But beware, this is not a good place for a beginner... of course, most albums aren't... you should start with "Flood" or "Dial-A-Song 
The album "They Got Lost" is should defenintlly not be a "First Time" album for any They Might be Giants (TMBG) newcomers. For those of you who are slow, this album was realesed back in 2002 on the TMBG website, but has now offically made it's debut to local retailers. Ok. So They Got Lost (TGL) is like a stale piece of bread. It taste flat, their seems to be no change in taste throughout anywhere. Yet some how it's good. Many people who have "John Henry" might feel a more heavy metal approach, people with The Spine know it has a more modern pop-rock grip. And Apollo 18 has a classic "Nerd Rock" hold. TGL on the other hand has a loose-leaf, soft rock, kind of feel. If I had to imply this album to a Earth landscape I'd say it fits that of a desert. The songs here are don't exactly have "rock out" kind of feel. More of a bland soothing hold. Now with out further a-do, I'll give you the songs: THE SONGS HERE ARE COMPARED TO TMBG'S SONGS ON OTHER ALBUMS Rest Awhile (5/10) "Hard Rock" This is without a doubt the fastest paced song, probably the only one you could jam too. Truth in Your Words (4/10) "Rock" This song feels like sombody made a lot softer version of "Rest Awhile" The song is pretty soft rock based, except for the main verse, where it suddenly picks up pace alittle. Over all, nothing special On the Drag (7/10) "Hard Rock" I personlly love this song, it has a Hard Rock kind of feel like rest while. And is a nice "rock out" song. All Alone (6/10) "Bluegrass" This song is on the "weird side" the song feels more occupied by "John" the singer, than the beat its self. Almost like a story with a beat. Down to the Bottom of the Sea (7/10) "Funk" Because of it's extremly catchy tune that last for 0:58 seconds you feel like you want more. This song interpreted some wierd effects into the song like a "bloop" of a submerine's randar every beat. A nice catchy short song. I'm Sick (Of this American Life)(6/10) "Dream Pop" A very smooth Beat and Rythem rock song. This song is good for using as sleep music Words are Like (7.5/10) "Soft Rock" This is maybe one of TMBG's best song for falling asleep, right next to Lazy Sleepy bones. The melodys nothing to listen to on your IPod. But defently somthing good if your trying to relax. I Am a Human Head (4/10) "Soft Rock" This song feels close to Truth in your words, in terms of music feel. I personlly dont like it that much, but like the rest of the album is great for relaxing to. Oranges (7/10) "Bluegrass" A very jumpy, country, springy song (bluegrass). Not much to say. It's an average. Empty Bottle Blues (7/10) "Jazz/Bluegrass" Has a jumpy "doo-woop" feel. Mixed with a trumpet. Oh, and theirs no singing either. They Got Lost (8.5/10 "Soft Rock" The best song on the album. A relaxing, far out their, desert, hot-day, kind of feel. Somthing you might listen to on a day that's 100 degrees. A great song, non the less. Reprehensible (7.5/10) "Jazz" A piano, based tune. Rat Patrol (7/10) "Blues Rock" Has a "bad-boy, highway, kind of feel" not exactly hard rock. Pretty neat. The Army's Tierd Now (6/10) "Celtic" Great for relaxation. perhaps one of the best TMBG's best relaxation songs. it's fairly short though, being a minute. Think of this song as a Celtic lulliby. Certain People I could name (7/10) "Soft Rock" Has a "They Got Lost" song, kind of feel. Desert, hot-day... Great for relaxation. Theme to McSweeney;s (7.5/10) "Electronic" Defenently somthing new for this album. This song has a "space" feel. All of this song is Electronic. And no, theirs no words. Dollar for Dollar (?/10) "???" A really screwed up 20 second, echo of John talking about a dollar. WTF? Mosh Momken Abadon (5/10) Folk/Electronic No words for this song. Token Back to Brooklyn (6/10) "Caribbean" A jambory, is played in this minute long song. Disappointing Show (1/10) "Soul" TMBG's worst song. The main verse is uncatchy and boring. The rest is talking. This song was obviouly taken from a live concert Oranges Testimonal The same thing as "Oranges" except with a intro. Bottom line is, if you want a layed back album, get this. I found it worth my buy. Nothing ground breaking in here, but it's a good tasting piece of stale bread non the less. 
This is a compilation of TMBG rarities that were previously only released online, on singles or on the McSweeney's bonus cd. Almost all of the tracks are excellent (with the exception of the McSweeney's tracks which just sound odd and out of place). TMBG's patented sense of humor is rampant throughout ("Words Are Like" and "Disappointing Show" will have you laughing out loud) and many of the tracks are real rockers. Now, there are some songs on here most TMBG fans are already sure to have (the tracks from the "Working Undercover For The Man" EP, "Token Back To Brooklyn" which was a hidden track on "Factory Showroom" and "Oranges" which was a hidden track on "No!") but the album works so well on a whole that it doesn't really matter. Ironically, the album's weakest track is the title track which is long and boring and doesn't hold a candle to the previously released live version from "Severe Tire Damage". 
Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo. These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording. That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms. Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name". But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more. Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress. Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it 
I don't know much about Danielle's genre of music but I thought this was a very good album and she sounds as good as any other female pop star out there. Why she hasn't had the break-through I have no idea. The lyrics are interesting and she sings with a great deal of power. Her cover of "Gimme Some Sign" was excellent. 
It's hard to believe this is a 1999 CD, where is she now??? The first 30 seconds of the first track..."What if God Fell From the Sky?" she rips open with a vengence, just what I expected from her backing Gregg Alexander and the New Radicals. All the passion that she and Gregg mustered for the New Radicals comes shining through in this effort. I finally picked this one up and was not disappointed with a single track...yea, it's pop/rock, but she's the real deal and her voice is stunning, passionate and vibrant, if still a little young. I simply can't believe she is not recording today. Personally one of the best. 
I HATE the songs, the lyrics, and the sources (most of these are simply covers versions of old 1970's 'soul' songs with popish new wave / modern rock / broadway aesthetics like New Radicals), but the SOUND - oh my god =8^D The sound is amazing! It is so new, so happy and just cool. It is totally devoid of any real emotion. It comes off just as fake as the idiot blues monkeys and popsters like Ashley Simpson, etc - however, this thing has a vibe that is very ethereal and theatric. What I hear when I listen is the FANTASY of what a woman COULD be, but certainly NOT what Danielle (or any woman) really IS. The words are just words, the sounds - nothing more than a device. You see the cool fire of the sound, and the poetry, but underneath - the cold vacant heart that is 'Lost Angeles Pop Star' type material. She may as well be singing about corn futures or pipe fittings - it's all the same to her - just fodder to scream and howl and whisper - and man is she sexy at it. You just want to subdue her and dance with her in the dream, but alas, she is all fake. She does not mean a single word. Believe me I have lived in L.A. and know the type. I've dated such gals. What I hear is not emotion, but simply the sound of someone who wants to be (or become again) famous LOL That's what she's really THINKING as she blurts out all the words - 'Oh play me on the radio, all the time. I'm gonna' make you love me - you'll be mine' bla bla bla LOL :)) These kinds of women (the actress / singer) are all just prostitutes who hate kids and rent themselves to the high bidder. Her obcessions are not love or progress, but money and exposure. It is as equally empty as the homosexual perversions so popularized by jewish media types - the 'Alanis' crowd, etc. The 'men suck' brigades. What you hear in this album is as fantastic as the Lord Of The Rings series - it is a FANTASY of something that never was and never will be. This is not what women realy are, but what we wish some of them were :) Search in vain perhaps, but know in reality people are prostitutes and that is all there really is - be they the corporate slave, the fake 'artiste', 'warrior' for the theft of nations, or whatever - this CD is a great escape. It suits it's mission. It delivers the goods - the fantazy. I give it 10 thumbs up! :D P.S.: This chick would have made a great 'Aeon Flux' for a movie or something. I guess she's old now. They should try some Romanian gals for pop singer (karaoke) is what they are now these days anyway - Romanian gals are the hottest on Earth 
This album, as well as the album "Portable Life" and the song "Keys to the World" from the film "Twilight of the Golds" are simply amazing! Some record label could be making a mint! If anyone knows where i can find a copy of "keys to the world" please let me know! 
The injustices of the music business can be summed up with this one album. "Arrive All Over You" is one of the most astonishing albums I have ever come upon, yet is an overlooked one that is now all but forgotten. Danielle opens her heart and delivers her soul on these 11 tracks. The opening track is an ominous one, a perfect prelude to what is about to come. "What If God Fell From The Sky?" starts with a simple question, then Danielle unleashes the power of her instrument, her voice. It's such a spine-tingling performance that it makes you long for more. On songs such as "I Ain't Gonna Cry No More" and "Just Missed The Train", we can really tell that this woman was really born to sing. In fact, I'm convinced that she chose the wrong artistic field, since she began as an actress (Little Stephanie on "All In The Family" and stage version of "Annie"). Produced by Gregg Alexander, with whom she would later work with on the One-Hit wonder band The New Radicals, and whom she duets on this CD with "Promise Tomorrow Night", this album is a tough one to categorize. Then again, an album that can't be categorized always means that it is a mould-breaking one. It has elements of folk, rock, and gospel, all of which contemplates Danielle's banshee and painfully beautiful vocals. Perhaps she was too ahead of the game to be successful, or perhaps people weren't ready for her. But whatever the reason is, the world can't continue to ignore primeval talent like Danielle Brisebois. It is a crime, a heinous crime that should be punished. And what is worse is the fact that she hasn't released a proper follow up since! Please return Danielle, the world needs you 
You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr 
Before female alt-rockers like Tori, Fiona, or Alanis made their mark, actress/singer Danielle Brisboise appeared on the scene with "Arrive All Over You." This 11-song collection of clever, slightly quirky pop/rock was the predecessor for what would follow, but never got the attention it deserves. With production, co-writing, vocal and instrumental contributions from the New Radicals' Gregg Alexander, Brisboise serves up a spunky, sexy album of pop rock that's smart but accessible. Her voice is strong and versatile, and the well-structured material gives her ample opportunities to show it off. Released in 1994, songs like "Middla My Heart," "Did I Lead You On," and "Ain't Gonna Cry No More" still maintain their fresh edge. "Gimme Little Sign" is simply a great pop song. "What If God Fell From The Sky" and the poignant "Just Missed The Train" have lost none of their emotional power. It boggles my mind that this album is now out of print. Search it out, it's well worth it. Brisboise's 1999 recording "Portable Life" remains unreleased. Hopefully she'll put it out independently so we fans can finally hear it 
'Drops Of Jupiter' was Train's sophmore release and it was hugely successful making many people realise that the band's hit with 'Meet Virginia' wasn't a one off success but that this band had a genuine talent. In this brilliant album release, Train straddles the easy melodies of pop rock with a rock jamming beat. Train comprises of 5 men with age and majestic experience behind them and it flows into their music. Pat Monahan has a excellent voice for singing, the words come out clean and pure and he doesn't range into the screams that many modern rock lead singers vaccilate towards. The album begins with a feel good song in 'She's On Fire' that is easy to sing along to with simply an amazing chorus. This is followed by the semi introverted 'I Wish You Would' and then the self titled song that became a radio staple 'Drops of Jupiter' that is one of Train's best songs. Another decent song is 'Hopeless' with a jamming rythmn and qaint lyrics. My favourite song on this album was the ageless beauty of a tranquil 'Whipping Boy' that Pat sings with a soft reserve and is a serenade for those downtrodden. The rest of the songs are fillers but still enjoyable and engaging in their own right and respect. This album is a must for any Train fan or soft-rock enthusiast. A perfect album for a romantic evening or a night out with friends or family. Train followed this album with more respect and fame. 
Like many reviewers, I can truly appreciate the title track, Drops of Jupiter. Great vocals, super keyboards and heart felt lyrics make this song(not CD) a true winner. The rest of the CD just sounds like run of the mill pop that is here today gone tommorow. She's On Fire, Its About You, Missisippi, and Let It Roll On are semi-memorable tunes with a few good harmonies thrown in for good measure. Otherwise this group sounds like they are merely trying to find their sound. It's too clean and pretty to be rock n roll but not natural enough to be country. Its merely syrupy hum drum pop that does not offend me but certainly does not move me either 
I bought this CD as a gift and it has been used every day. Recipient said he enjoys ALL the music is VERY glad to have received it. I also like to listen to it 
Back twenty or more years ago Lacy J. Dalton sang 16th Avenue, a superb country song about unknowns seeking their musical fortune in Nashville. One verse had this lyric: Ah, but then one night in some empty room Where no curtains ever hung Like a miracle some golden words Rolled off of someone's tongue Well, that's Train. They had the miracle of Drops of Jupiter and who knows where it came from, but come it did, like a slap to the face and always remained fabulous with every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing. (Though I could do without all the "na-na-na-na-na" background over the last minute or so.) And beyond that, there is not a single thing on this CD worth hearing, relentless mediocrity, as if one were trapped on the state fair circuit, hearing big-haired bands from the 80's eternally playing their semi-hits while roller coaster and dodge 'em cars add to the aural clutter. Two stars for one miracle of brilliance. 
I loved this CD. "Let It Roll" is my favourite. The lyrics are just great and the music is beautiful. "Mississippi" is another fave...the guitar and sax melody is gorgeous. "She's On Fire" is a great song! Especially sung live. "I Wish You WOuld" Not my favourite but a good song to sing along to 
Drops of Jupiter is one of my favorite albums. i have very high regard for Train in general, in my mind they are one of the better bands out right now. the lead singer has increadible range and they use a wide variety of instruments. each album has a different sound and direction, although it is always possible to pick out the "train" sound. Drops of Jupiter its self, though a bit over played on the radio, is i think one of the most brilliant love/pop songs to come out in the last ten years. the album has a big mix of sounds on it, from very mellow to realatively rocky but it is, in general, very listenable. 'Mississippi' is very mellow, but it grows with time is very beautifuly sung, he doesn't push his voice at all or use a gigantic range. 'Whipping Boy' jumps around quite a bit but it works, and they always bring it back to the point. their lyrics are clever, and not overstated. they don't go over board but their not insipid either. they stick to the 'love' line of writing in general, but their love songs are beautiful. 'Hopeless' has happened to a lot of people at some point and i enjoy it greatly. the album is not overstated: they dont over play, he doesnt over sing and it still has an edge, which is something that i find much modern music lacks. 
Cryin' Heart Blues is another collection of tracks from the Rick Danko archives. It's a mixture of 17 live and studio cuts and demos and old favourites as well as tracks not previously released. 'When I Get My Just Rewards' and 'Lay Back In The Arms Of Someone' are polished studio works while 'New Mexicoe' is somewhat looser than the released version despite the possible presence of Eric Clapton and Ron Wood - not a very distinguished version, I have to say, so the guitarists could be Eric Wood and Ron Clapton for all the difference they make. 'Twilight' is in its compulsory second place in the running order and is a nice full band version. Among the live tracks 'Java Blues' and 'Unfaithful Servant' with Blondie Chaplin and Paul Butterfield both stand out and the CD is topped and tailed with two different live takes of 'Mystery Train'. There can't be a lot left to release from any of the Band archives but what there is still sounds pretty good 
Singer/instrumentalist Rick Danko melded country and urban soul influences into a unique sound that some of us will always wish for more of. For us, this collection of previously unreleased material was issued some six years after his death. Three tracks here -- the Motownish "Turn to Stone" and "Cry Another Tear" and the pure-country "When I Get My Just Rewards" -- are among the most beautiful vocals he ever recorded and, alone, justify this disc. Given that chronic sobriety issues hampered his career, it is somewhat distressing to hear him so obviously hammered on certain tracks, including the four live tracks that close the album, but it can't be denied that those tracks rock hard 
Danko has always had that special joy and vulnerability in his material. This set is no disappointment, though he is less prominent in some of the tracks. Some are alternate takes of Danko/Band standards, but none are throwaways. The live cuts with Paul Butterfield are a welcome addition, especially the riveting version of Unfaithful Servant (with an incredible harmonica solo by Butterfield). 
We need to toast to this West coast classic. Coming from NY this one banged to the west coast. It also enhanced my drinking habit during my high school days but damn it was worth every last drop. Just remember to keep the brown bag over your 40 oz. (remember that? 
i remember taking the train from brooklyn to nyc the year this dropped and just bein at an outdoor train station on a nice day listenin' to the liks for the first time. east coast cats loved the liks. for a while, when they first came out, east coast cats actually thought they were from the east coast. don't know if anyone remembers that. either way this album bumps all the way through and is a must buy if you love real hip-hop 
This is one of the best Alkaholiks albums!! U have 2 do... sorry, buy it : 
This album was the start of the alkaholiks who had a different style to most other west coast artists of that time. Their sound was more like an east coast flavour but with their own style of flows. They had some nice rhymes that had a lot put into them and could flow really well together (j-ro tash). The production and mixing is excellent, not one thing wrong. Its shorter than a lot of other albums that were around that time, but it doesn't matter because the whole album is good and you won't think about the money you spent after. I would advise anyone who wants to know about the real hip hop to get this, or if you slept on it in the past to get it. These were the days of real creative, original hip hop. peace for now 
J-Ro , Tash and E-Swift rip tha mic! CLASSIC! If you a real hip hop head you must have it 
This is the best Liks album, and I can't figure out why. Like most people, I like the Liks because of Tash. BUT, J-Ro gets WAY more time on this album than does Tash. So, why do I like this one better than the later Liks albums and even better than Tash's solo joint? I don't know, but DON'T SLEEP. This is one of my favorite albums ever. The rhymes, beats, and guest spots (esp. King-Tee) are great. Besides, like other great debuts, this album has this wild sense of fun and excitement (like Pharcyde's first). Whenever Tash grabs the mic, it's on....but, J-Ro really seems like the star of this album. For example, one of the best jams is Make Room...and Tash doesn't even rap on it. Still, for classic Tash flows, check out his verse on Only When I'm Drunk...a great song. Also, the 1st track is so amazing that for 1 month after buying this I never heard another song on the album. Beware, most songs have a heavy emphasis on God's Great Liquid...check out the sweet cover art 
Before I purchased this album, I always had listened to rap or hip-hop primarily for the beats. I would buy CD's that had one single on MTV, thinking that the beat was hot. I would wonder why these albums would get old after several listenings. I needed something that was more fulfilling. When I first bought this album, I have to admit that I didn't think much of it at first. I loved the beat for Make Room, but that was about it. As I was determined to not let my [money] go to waste, I kept the album on heavy rotation. It sounded better and better every time that I listened to it, and taught me that hip-hop or any true art, is never appreciated at first glance. This album epitomizes everything that is real in hip-hop: dope lyrics, fluid beats, and intellectual creativity. Tha Liks prove that they are true to hip-hop by not pursuing any false, trendy ideals and just representing themselves with their music. Some ill shit by some down-to-earth, funny, drunk muthafuckas 
This is easily one of the best rap albums of the 90s. It is fun, party rap that has good rhymes, good MCing, great beats, and terrific guest spots. Also has excellent production 
On hearing Matthew would be playing in Toronto, I ran out and bought a copy of "Living Things". I was disappointed to the point where I thought I would skip his live show. Luckily my wife insisted we go. Matthew looked a mess. The band was 3 guitars, a bass, and drum. The volume and the feedback were way up and they burnt through blistering renditions of almost all of "Living Things" plus his other big hits. From that moment on I have loved "Living Things". So if you find "Living Things" disappointing you need to just catch Matthew playing it live. It will rock for you after that 
I am a huge Matthew Sweet fan, but this album doesn't make the grade. The music just feels lifeless and there isn't one song on here that caught me with the usual Matthew Sweet "hooks". I have seen Matthew play several times, I own every stitch of material he has ever released and consider him a "pop" music genius, but I seriously doubt this one will ever make it to the CD player drawer again 
Living Things is very disappointing. The previous CD, Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, was such a powerful collection of songs, written and recorded with such clarity and immediacy, a rock classic that is truly one of his best efforts alongside Girlfriend. Living Things is touted as Sweet's return to a fully produced, thought-out album. It even has Van Dyke Parks...so it must be a slice of Wilson-esque classic pop, like In Reverse...right? There's only one problem: the songs. Living Things rings very hollow musically, and lyrically it is hopelessly bleak, the actual opposite feeling of the album's title. This is not a sunny pop album, it is a dark series of resignations on the hopelessness of life, with almost none of Sweet's humor to balance out the darkness. It just feels like a bad head trip. I have listened intently to this disc, in various settings and states of mind, and have come up short every time. The material is lacking a heart, a center of gravity. Yes, it has all the external elements of Sweet's pop sheen: the overlaid vocals, the guitar textures, the power pop grooves. On the surface, it all sounds attractive, but underneath all the layers is empty, bleak music. It feels like "Matthew Sweet by the numbers." Moreover, Living Things is supposed to be a more "produced" album than Kimi Ga Suki, and yet it feels sloppy and unrehearsed. Only a couple of the songs have a proper "ending" or even a fade-out. Most of the tracks sound like demos, with haphazard sloppy endings where the music abruptly cuts off as if the band were only rehearsing the song and decided to quit before the end. This is not a well produced album, to be honest it sounds unprofessional. And the fact that there is no booklet, no lyrics, also shows that Matthew wanted to put this CD out "on the cheap," which shows some disregard for his fans, in my opinion. Girlfriend, Altered Beast, 100% Fun, In Reverse, all of these discs have always had some form of lyric booklet. Even with Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, there was a booklet with liner notes by Matthew, a sense of personal involvement. But on Living Things, nothing. Just the tracklist and personnel. I detect a disinterest on Sweet's part, a lack of concern for our reaction to the sloppy song endings, the redundant material, or the lack of any liner notes or lyrics. Matthew seems essentially absent from the whole operation, from the packaging to the songs. One reviewer compared this album to Altered Beast, which also had a more densely layered production style, a more "experimental" album than, say, Girlfriend. But at least Altered Beast still had a very high calibre of songs: Dinosaur Act, Ugly Truth, Time Capsule, Life Without You, Reaching Out, Falling. There is nothing on Living Things that stands out as a memorable song in the end. It all sounds like a series of hooks and textures that don't go anywhere. Another example of a more "produced" Sweet album is 1999's In Reverse, which has the Spector/Wilson "Wall of Sound" production on some tracks, but again, it works well because Sweet wrote a solid collection of SONGS for that album. Hide, Split Personality, I Should Never Have Let You Know, Write Your Own Song. These are all true gems in Sweet's catalog. And once again, Living Things fails to produce even ONE song that rises above the surface exterior in order to make a lasting impression. Really, I cannot think of even one song that stands on its own merits. "You're Not Sorry" and "I Saw Red" are probably the "best" tracks, but even those songs only sound like hollow imitations of much stronger material by Sweet on previous albums. He's covered all of this ground before, with much better results. For an album called "Living Things," it all sounds lifeless, a collection of dead shells. Attractive containers with nothing inside. 
I just got Living Things in the mail today and listened to it once through. Here's my impression: It's a very good album. The one thing I miss is the down and out power pop rockers as this album has none. However, this gem is pure Matthew Sweet and shows off a lot of his gentler, more reflective side. The arrangements are reminiscent of In Reverse. It is a very "lush" sound. He continues to use unusual instruments like the steel drums and the theremin. The standout tracks (from just one listen) are I Saw Red, In my Time, and Tomorrow. Matthew has some rather quirky lyrics in Big Cats of Shambala and Dogs vs. Cats. Overall this is a wonderful album to listen to when relaxing or feeling reflective. I would've given this one five stars if it contained just one rocker like "Ocean in Between," "Evangeline," or "Sick of Myself," etc... Matthew's music has "matured" as of late but he keeps putting out genius stuff. I hope we see many more albums from him because he's capable of cranking out good stuff 
Matthew Sweet's albums released since 100% Fun have shown an increasing willingness to cave in to his own personal eccentricities. Living Things is no exception. Many of these songs are a little corny, silly, etc. I enjoy his carefree style of songwriting, and his willingness to experiment with different instruments and sounds, but his songs seem more impersonal since the days of Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and 100% Fun. Or if they are personal, they are about matters that are less close to his heart. I find his earlier albums much more emotionally involving. But what hasn't changed is his ability to write a killer tune. And there are about 5 such killer tunes on Living Things, that would rank right up there with his best ever in my opinion, which makes it well worth owning. And while I just criticized the change in his approach to song writing over the years, I must say that this is his best sounding album since 100% Fun. It doesn't sound gimicky or poorly produced, which has really hurt his last few albums 
I don't understand all the references in other reviews to "repeat listenings necessary." This is immediately accessible sugar-coated melodic pop, the kind of thing Sweet (never a more apt surname for an artist) has always done best. Thing is, it was immediately (after one listening!) clear to me that this was his best record. I say that without reservation 
This one takes about six listenings before you are caught. Believe me - it is worth it. I'm a bit worried about his obsession with time. Many of his lyrics these last few albums seems to suggest that he thinks he is a has-been. I think nothing could be further from the truth. I really hope he keeps kicking out albums like this in the future, and not giving up like Elliot Smith did 
I hated this album the first time. I didn't even make it all the way through, and I'm a huge fan of his. However, it seems to get better each time I play it. I admit there are still two songs I don't like - though, actually, "Cats vs Dogs" is not one of them. That one is just a variation on the kind of thing Randy Newman or Harry Nilsson used to do. This isn't a rock record, but it's a good record. For some reason, Matthew's later work doesn't jump out at you as quickly as the Girlfriend/Altered Beast era. The quality now sneaks up on you. He's never going to be a commercial force again, but I wanted to say that - if you ever liked him - you're missing out in the long run if you blow this one off. If he puts out a home record like this every year or two, it's good for all of us 
My two toddlers love Scholastics "Where The Wild Things Are" DVD, which features some of the songs on this Carole King CD. It was the DVD that inspired me to purchase this CD, because the songs are infectious and well done. I'm not a fan of Carole King, and this is not a trip down memory lane for me, just some of the best music for kids that I have run across. If you are unfamiliar with these tunes, the original stage production, and/or the Maurice Sendak books from which the lyrics are lifted, don't let that keep you from purchasing some of the most creative and imaginative music available for kids. I am very glad I did. We crank it up in the car have a blast 
I have been looking for this CD for years. When I was little I said "I don't Care" all the time when I was asked a question. My parents played it for me. I own the CD and plan to play it for my daughter. I wish they would release the cartoons on DVD 
My 7 month old loves this cd as do I. It is fun playing it in the car singing along and remembering the first time I saw the Really Rosie special in second grade. There isn't a more enjoyable cd for the adults and kiddos alike. I highly recommend this cd 
MY MOM INTRODUCED THIS MOVIE TO ME BACK IN LIKE 1989, I WAS ONLY 3 AT THE TIME BUT HAVE OLD HOME MOVIES OF ME WATCHING THIS, SINGING ALONG JUST ABSOLUTLY LOVING IT. I AM 20 YEARS OLD NOW AND I HAVE BEEN GOING CRAZY TRYING TO DOWNLOAD ALL THESE SONGS OFF THIS SOUNDTRACK...I HAVENT HEARD THESE SONGS IN OVER 10 YEARS AND THE SECOND 1 OF MY DOWNLOADS FINISHED I WAS SINGING EVERY SINGLE WORD AS IF I HAVE HEARD IT EVERYDAY..I COULDNT BELEIEVE I REMEBERD IT SO WELL. I TRUELY RECOMMEND REALLY ROSIE TO ANYONE BECAUSE IT IS BAD ASS 
This album was great. When I actually found it, I had to get it fast. I used to listen to this album when my mother bought it for me endlessly (this was when I turned 8 or 9). Now, my 3 boys love it. While I forgot how some of the songs are rather graphic (I had memorized all the songs when I was little and was able to sing along once more after hearing them again) they are great for boys 
When I was a little girl (8 yrs. old or so), my grandparents took my sister, my cousins, and I to Radio City Music Hall to see Really Rosie. My grandpa bought me the album, which I still have, even though I no longer have a record player. I'm so glad that I can share this with my 4 yr. old son - Chicken Soup with Rice is his favorite song (how nice! 
I brought this CD from a amazon reccomendation after buying "Free To Be... You And Me". This is a very good CD and is well worth the money. After hearing the CD, it came back to me (as I do remember some of the tracks!) that I probably watched the "Really Rosie" TV special sometime between 1976 and 1978. Just one more thing. Could someone re-relase the "Really Rosie" TV special on DVD someday? I'm sure if it was, people (including me) would buy it 
I first saw this cartoon in my first grade class back in 1982. The music stuck with me all these years. I rented the VHS from my local library and my 5 year old daughter fell in love with the music. The CD has a few songs that the movie didn't include and Carole King does a fabulous job. It really is worth the purchase 
I can't tell you how happy I am to finally find this childhood favorite of mine and my sisters. The first time we watched Really Rosie I was 6 and my sisters were 4 and 2. We listened to the soundtrack constantly. I now have a 6 year old daughter named Rosie and I have been looking for this soundtrack since I became pregnant with her. I have tried for years to find this soundtrack or even the book by Maurice Sendak with no luck. My sisters have both just given birth and I can't think of a better baby gift that would have the same sentimental value. Thank you so much for making it possible to share this favorite of ours with our children 
If you are an old movie fan you will love this cd.You can almost see Fred and Ginger dancing. Just great!!! 
I'm a big Paul Weller fan- have been for years- but I have had trouble "getting into" some of his more recent records. Not so with "As is Now"- this is an incredible record with intense guitarwork, fantastic production, and poignant lyrics. All of those things that we love Paul Weller for in the first place. Weller mixes intense songs like "Floor Boards Up" - reminiscent of The Jam and and songs off of "Town Called Malice", with more thoughtful orchestrated pieces like "Misty Morning"- evoking a sense of his more recent, contemplative work. Not only is every song a great tune in it's own right, but the entire record works well as a cohesive work of art. Rarely these days do artists manage to pull together a collection of diverse songs musically that fit together so well lyrically- when it happens it's like magic, and this record is "magic". It reminds me of a time when albums were released that told a story, at the very most giving us compelling narrative, at the least giving us a glimpse into the psyche of the artist. This record gives us a BIG peek at what Weller has on his mind these days and what he feels compelled to write and sing about, loss, regret, atonement, yet coupled with tenacity. All on the same record. All from the same voice. Buy it - it will be the hipest thing you do all year, Weller is a 'cat' in the true sense of the word and deservedly so, he's worked hard to get where he is at - "As is Now" is his climax artisically in my opinion. Not to mention he is still one of the hottest old men in Rock and Roll- and the fashion! Don't even get me started on the fashion- look at the cover! 
The Modfather has done it again. This, the seventh consecutive fine record from Mr. Weller (after a somewhat musically lost period dating back to the Style Council), sees (hears) him covering all the bases. From the straight-ahead punk rock of "From the Floorboards Up" to funk ("Bring Back the Funk" to the olde folk stylings of "All on a Misty Morning," it's quite an assemblage of soulful musical stylings. If you haven't heard him in a while, you'll be surprised at how good this stuff is - and his band on this and the previous couple of records is a juggernaut, with Steve Craddock and Damon Minchella borrowed permanently from Ocean Colour Scene, and longtime drummer Steve White still expertly plying his craft. For the first time ever as far as I know, PW is listed as the rhythm guitarist, testimony to his maturity and his band's greatness. "Come On, Let's Go." 
"AS IS NOW"... Paul Weller at his best. The man rocks out from the first chord to the last. I can't seem to get enough of this CD. I couldn't pry it out of my car CD player... so I bought another for the house. It's THAT GREAT. 
I have criminally overlooked Paul Weller for many years now. I don't own anything from The Jam, Style Council or Paul Weller's solo work. I decided to get "As Is Now" after I saw the video for "From The Floorboards Up" on VH1 Classic/Current. So, without having anything to compare this to I have to say this is pretty good music. There are several affecting songs here like "Come On/Let's Go", "The Start Of Forever", "Pan", "Bring Back The Funk Pts 1 2" and "The Pebble And The Boy". Mr. Weller seems to touch upon various topics such as dysfunctional families in "From The Floorboars Up", aging in "The Pebble And The Boy", life changes in "Blink And You'll Miss It", spirituality in "Pan" and so on. This is mature music for mature listeners, and it's great to have an artisit like Weller who is making age-appropriate commentaries and not trying to pander to the younger crowd. He also deftly incorporates blues, rhythm blues, funk, rock, psychedelica and jazz into "As Is Now", making it a satisfying experience. The only shame is that in America Weller is virtually unknown. In Europe he's huge, and I can see why. If only his music received more attention... I'm sure Weller fans are enjoying this one, but if you've not heard of him, I suggest taking a listen to "As Is Now" 
While last year's Studio 150 may have been a stop-gap for Paul Weller as he took a break from songwriting and regained his muse, it was an extremely important record for him. It was the freshest sounding record of his solo career. It was crisp, varied, and marked the best production of his music since his late Jam and then Style Council days with producer Peter Wilson. It felt like Studio 150 marked the beginning of a new phase of his illustrious career that is going on 30 years. As Is Now comes a year after Studio 150 and is arguably Weller's best solo album. It simply sounds better than his other releases. The string arrangements on 2000's Heliocentric were wonderful, but certain tracks retained that plodding, hushed production. His other records just didn't cut it sonically. Thanks to co-producer Jan "Stan" Kybert, the new Weller sound is a lot like the old Weller sound - old meaning pre 1992. For the first time on a solo record, there are songs here that would have been at home on Jam and Style Council records. This is a varied album, fitting for the man with the ever changing moods. He has always included a few brilliant songs on every record, but this one consistently delivers with just a few trite efforts. Here's a track by track listing: Blink And You'll Miss It - Solid rocking opener. This album's Sunflower. But the guitars sound better on this one. Paper Smile -Melodically challenged. Sort of more in line with some of his lesser solo material. Not bad, just nothing for him to write back to Woking about. I often press the skip button on this one. Come On/Let's Go - That's Entertainment 25 years later. Excellent and infectious. Jam-like and fresh sounding. Here's the Good News - Pleasant and light-hearted fare from an oft-alleged curmudgeon. Piano-based horn-tinged number is a nice change of pace. The Start of Forever - This proves he can still write ballads. Understated and effective. Sincere vocals and a nice melody make this one a keeper. They should have, however, done without the guitar insert tagged onto the end of the song. This unnecessary flourish has plagued many of Weller's solo records. Pan - Haunting and wonderful. It harkens back to the Style Council - offering one of his best, most hummable melodies since the mid-80s. The arrangement is nice, and Weller's piano playing has gotten excellent. Odd subject matter, though - the goat-man of Greek mythology. All on a Misty Morning - Good playing and sort of Wildwood- esque, but I can't really get into this one as much as I'd like. Some fans say it is the best on the album. Not bad, mind you, but a little limp. From the Floorboards Up - Turn this one up to 11. Jam-ish rock and rock at its finest. It's only fault is that it's too short. A great one to turn up in the car and roll your windows down. I Wanna Make it Alright - Slight but pleasant enough. Savages - Quintessential Weller. He takes on violence and terror and all who attack "those whose love is growing." Great tune with great vocals. Fly Little Bird - OK, so it's repetitive. But it has a lilting, soothing tune that makes me care less about the refrain. It feels like a song about healing. Roll Along Summer - The Style Council meets the pastoral solo Paul. Great playing although it doesn't pack an emotion wallop. Bring Back The Funk - Truth is, most critics and fans really don't like this one, but a few seem to praise it readily. I'm with the group who likes it. It is very Style Council, and it really works. People have written that it's very white soul. Not sure what the problem is with that. It has a good groove, and the band sounds great. Very different from his sometimes rigid solo sound. The Pebble and the Boy - This could have fit nicely on the Piano Paintings side of The Style Council's Confessions of a Pop Group album. It is as brilliant as a pop song can be. Piano, voice, and strings swell to provide a musical opportunity for introspection. Classic Weller. With a new producer and a reignited fire, Paul Weller once again rises to the top. He is a mature artist whose work reflects that. Hopefully, this time even the US audience will take notice. 
Paul Weller's As Is Now is a strong recording from start to finish. It ranks as his third best solo recording (behind Paul Weller (1992) and Wildwood (1993)). It strikes a nice balance between sharp rockers and pastoral rollers. There are a couple tracks that really stand out: Savages is an instant classic and is part of a mini suite including Fly Little Bird and Roll Along Summer. All On A Misty Morning has a nice acoustic guitar hook that draws you in and wouldn't sound out of place on a Traffic album. As Is Now is a continuation of the roots style he has developed over the past ten years or so. Some songs harken back to earlier periods. Paper Smile could easily have appeared on Heavy Soul and Come On/Let's Go on Illumination. But the overall quality and cumulative effect of one good song after another makes As Is Now one of the best. (...) there is no slap-bass on Bring Back The Funk. The song is similar to funky instrumentals on various b-sides except he added lyrics. [DW] 
You just can't keep a good man down. After sleeping through last year's rather pedestrian cover album Studio 101 it seemed that Paul Weller had finally reached the bottom of his creative well. In fact, the quality of his albums had been on a slow downward spiral since 1994's Wild Wood, so it's a pleasant surprise then that Weller has produced his best album in a decade. It's a return to the 3-minute guitar pop songs of his Jam days mixed with the funky soul that Weller has long established as one of his strengths. At still only 47 years old it seems "The Modfather's" days on top are long from numbered. 
I recently took in a Weller show at the Avalon in Boston; most of the front two rows was filled with fans who had seen him in New York the night before and they were still shaking their heads in amazement at the energy and passion Weller displayed. This is an artist at the peak of his creative powers - he truly was a man on fire, and as another reviewer stated, could teach many a 20 or 30-something what a real rock star looks and sounds like. His voice is strong and soulful with a tinge of cigarette-induced rasp; his guitar work is muscular and passionately nuanced (he's vastly underrated for his guitar work). Simply, the new album is one of his best. My favorite solo efforts are the hippy-trippy Paul Weller and more soulfully introspective Wild Wood. The material is nicely balanced between urgent rave-ups and soulful ballads. It can't be left unsaid just how much Steve White and Steve Craddock contribute respectively to the overall sound - White's wonderfully galloping, jazz-influenced drumming style and Craddock's elegant guitar leads and fills are now part and parcel of the Weller sound. There are the usual unpredictable production flourishes that we've come to expect from Weller, as well as nods to the Who, the Beatles, and an awkward but credibly funky tip of the hat to Nile Rogers. Some tracks crackle and hum right out of the box (Blink, From the Floorboards); others take a while to grow on you (Pan, On A Misty Morning). This has been my experience with Weller - he takes so many chances, ventures down unexpected paths - that it takes a few listens to let it all sink in. There are a few weak tracks, but really strong material overall. Having followed Weller's solo career with much more interest anything he did with the Jam or Style Council, Weller's current work combines elements of his Traffic/Small Faces infatuation, his affection for soul music, the urgent passion and fury of the Jam years, and the more playful Continental musings of the Style Council - and he wraps it all together with skill and artistic maturity. It's criminal that he gets so little press recognition stateside. By all means - if you ever get a chance to catch him in concert, get there however you can! He's ferociously good. This album is a great primer for those new to Weller. The expanded edition of this release has some video clips, a short film, and a booklet - thoughtful extras for the true fan. On a final note, even though the Modfather is approaching the big 5-0, this guy is a stone cold Super Fox. We should all age so well. WELLA 4-EVAH 
With a hypnotic mixture of r and smooth jazz.Singer,songwriter Ms.Maysa Leak comes at you and just takes you away with a secial style all her own.Her voice is wonderful and smooth and on top of that she's beautiful.This lady is loaded with talent.And she seems to have great musical taste.Something that seems to be lacking in some other young female singers of this generation.I'm very much impress with this album and I listen to it a lot.With songs like Unexpectedly,Hypnotic Love,One More Chance,Smooth Sailing and Where Do You Go?.Is what makes this album such a standout.And I plan on buying a lot more Maysa albums in the future 
Since this is my first Maysa album I read many of the other listener's glowing reviews first so that I may offer something different to the collection of opinions. Most strikingly Maysa's voice resembles the legendary Roberta Flack, as well as Anita Baker, and Lalah Hathaway. Track 5 (Where Do You Go?) sounds like a song that could have been on a Julie Dexter album, and if you aren't familiar with her, she is another fine jazz vocalist with a more Diana Ross range rather than the alto of Maysa. You will be reminded of Luther Vandross on track 7 and 10 (All day Long and One More Chance)not only in the instrumental track but in Maysa's vocal phrasing. The latter half of the album swings very much toward contemporary r b and many of the background tracks sound like samples and loops you may have heard from some other artist on some other album. Overall many of the songs sound similar in arrangement and theme, but Maysa fans, don't be furious, if it wasn't for her gloriously rich vocals, I would not have listened so many times to rate this album one star below the highest rating. Regardless, you will find this a good album and love many of the songs, without a doubt 
I fell in love with Maysa's voice when she sang with Incognito in the early to mid 90's. I still cant get over songs like "Deep Waters" and their version of "Don't you worry 'bout a thing" Ever since Maysa has launched her solo career, I've been watching it like a hawk because her voice and the music production on her albums have been nothing short of perfection. This album is by no means any different. In fact, I believe its her tightest album to date. I didnt think that was possible after hearing songs like "Out of the blue", "Head to the sky" and one of my personal favorites "Everything", on her last album. However there is something that is so mature and mysterious about this album. She is constantly redefining herself while staying true to her unique style of music. She walks the fine line of r and jazz to perfection. Although every song on this album is good, Standouts include "Smooth sailing", "Soul Child", The ear orgasmic "Where do you go?", The window down, sunroof open, driving down the interstate jam "So very hot", and the r crossover "Where have you been?" As long as Maysa makes music, I will be buying it. I hope that this isnt her last project. Also, for all you Maysa fans who like good music [...] The album is called "Seasons of life". 
This goes on my favorite list by Maysa. A great CD to put on and chill to. Once again she has proven herself to be great solo artist 
This is a beautiful example of music that you dont just listen to, but you 'feel'. Stunning vocals from the heart. Maysa just keeps getting better and this is her finest work to date. Do yourself a favour and buy this. This music will embrace you an touch your soul. Exquisite!!!! 
I am blown away by the depth and sound this lady and her genre can provide. Close your eyes and listen to every one of these songs and you will find the source of pleasure in the soul. What I am constantly being amazed at are the arrangers on these albums. Maysa, Jennifer Brown, Chant Moore, Khani Cole. They all produce what can only be described as music for the ages. This type of sound will be "in" forever because it is such a beautiful part of our inner vibrations. I can only say that if you like this genre, Buy it no matter what!!! All her albums I have found to be that way. That is why I mention the other women above because they all deserve much more attention from the public than they get.. Wow!! Delight in these sounds...... and let reality go away for a while.... Thanks Maysa again......................... 
It's Maysa. That's all one really needs to say about this phenomenal woman. Doesn't matter if the song is uptempo, midtempo, or down tempo, you think, you're in flight. Her vocals are smooth and buttery...! If you're just being introduced to Maysa, you have quite a few projects to choose from..not just her solo albums, but her superb work with Incognito. She truly is a voice of our time. Such talent. 
I have long been a great fan of Maysa's first solo album (self titled) from 1995 and have enjoyed her work ever since. This album 'Smooth Sailing', has all the elements you'd expect from Maysa; Soul, RnB, Jazz, upbeat and smooth. Every track a winner. 'Hypnotic Love' and 'Scat World' being particular favorites of mine. If this album is your first taste of Maysa, I guarantee you won't be disappointed and you'll definitely be coming back for more. The UK release of this album (available from www.amazon.co.uk) contains two additional tracks 
This is a nice CD. I bought 3 cds around the same time and Maysa's is the only one that I can listen to without skipping over a lot of songs and feeling like I've wasted my money. It was worth it. I missed her the last time she was in Detroit so hopefully she will come back this year 
Oh, Coop, whydya ever record that album with Bud Shank?!??!! 
This is one of the few discs I have seen with Bob Cooper as a leader outside of the "Kenton Presents" works on Mosaic (which I highly recommend also). Cooper was primarily a tenor sax player who got his start with Kenton and then fell into the west coast studio scene in the 1950's like many of his contemporaries. he often played unconventional reeds like oboe but this disc showcases his arranging talents. The first piece is a jazz theme and four variations which winds though several moods from swing to blues. This is followed by several standards with very interesting orchestration ranging from the big sound of a studio band to more intimate takes with tenor over rhythm section. The other players are a who's who of west coast jazz - Rosolino, Candoli, Fagerquist, Lou Levy, Mel Lewis and even Victor Feldman on vibes. Tasty stuff 
I first played this during a 500-mile trip back home and wondered why I'd wasted the money. Ironically enough, it has ended up being one of my most-played CDs. At first I thought this disc contained a few strong songs (the opener especially) interspersed with too-many incomplete song fragments, but for whatever reason, I've come to love this music. I have to admit that it's low-key and fey, for the most part, and I'm sometimes uncomfortable when my students (I teach high school) hear me listening to it, but I've come to recognize it as a coherent and beautiful piece of work. I'm sure I'll be listening to it before school tomorrow. Just one person's emotional response, all in all 
Since 1978, Scritti Politti has been made up of Green Gartside and whoever he's working with; in this fifth full-length release (seven years since the last), Gartside returns alone with tight over-dubbed harmonies and a host of varied influences distilled into a pop sound that's a little hard to define. The reggae-influenced rhythms reappear without sounding like reggae; an homage to hip-hop (track 1) couldn't sound less like hip-hop. I also catch bits of the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, and echoes of the mid-eighties Scritti Politti that was, only without the dated sound. The ballads, which might have been insufferable, are actually quite wonderful; the up-tempo songs are as much fun as you'd expect. All in all, a complex album that's very easy to listen to 
This release is ambitious ( and so much better than that rap/hip mon ami bon ami release a few years back ) - AND it is SCRITTI. There are a few moments that get too precious, Beatle-wise; however in total it is one of the very few perfect listening experiences released this year. I just wish Green was still young and blonde. What a remarkable talent. Makes you think and wonder 
Deviating from the hip-hop of 1999's Anomie Bonhomie, Green takes a reductionist approach to his sound more remisicent of his earliest work on Songs to Remember, though certainly retaining his distinctive polished vocals. White Bread- also continues his slow evolution away from processed instruments and the trademark "hyper-mix" signature sound of Cupid Psyche and Provision. Most of White Bread features fairly straight instrumental arrangements and a surprising amount of ambient noise, as if recorded in his kitchen. The songs are mostly beautiful mature contemplations on his(now middle aged)life and relationships, with a few straightforward pop knock-offs and some oddly quiet and un-conventionally structured pieces that were hinted at on Anomie. In closing, not much on here resembles Cupid Psyche, but if you're a contempory of that album, odds are, you don't resemble that listener from 1985 anymore either 
I have a number of Scritti Politti albums, including the incomparable Cupid and Psyche '85. This isn't a close comparison. Much too slow, lugubrious, contemplative. Puts me to sleep. Suffers from an overly simple production and uninteresting unlayered backgrounds on what sounds like one tired synth. This isn't horrible, but given the genius of the other albums, this one suffers. I wish I hadn't purchased this album. 
I've been a huge fan of Green since hearing EP'S so long ago. So needless to say I think this collection of songs is without a doubt very enjoyable! After the first listen, I thought, that was not what I expected, very laid back!! Upon further ventures into his new disc, all I can think of is, WOW, these are beautiful songs!! He has come up with some of the most, for lack of a better word, "PRETTY" sondscapes I've heard,well,forever! I'm not kidding!! I challenge anyone to give an open mind to this recording and not be moved. NOT GUSHING, but for my money this is what music is all about. The songs are all so textured, it makes me happy to know someone is out there who is willing to go deeper into his heart and soul to create such passion in mere minutes! Keep doing what you feel like doing Green Gartside, and I'll keep buying it!! Get this Music and you'll have years of great thoughts and I hope, inspiration for more peace in your lives. GET this DISC!!! I know I feel a whole lot better with WHITE BREAD BLACK BEER in my life. Thank You for your time 
The mix of sad and sweet and the velvety layers of this cd has made WBBB one that I will turn to over and over, for years to come, and always hear and feel something new
