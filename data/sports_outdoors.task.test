1	have n't had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money . it does a lot of exercises . and seems easy to convert between types
1	first off , let me start by saying that i really like my summit watch . it is large ( some may go so far to call it huge ) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist , and quite comfortable to wear . those with bad eyesight will still be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time , barometric pressure , altitude and compass . the numbers are quite big , so they are difficult to miss . the altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot , which is about as good as you can get . i like that . but what i really like about the highgear watches that i have n't seen in other brands which offer similar features , is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be . no kidding , this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . the barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather , however after months of use , i have to say that my little watch is way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i 'd say somewhere around 75 % of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually are . not bad . it 's a feature i would very much like to have on my suunto and casio models with similar functions . until then , i 'll rely on my trusty ( and much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass , altitude and barometer functions , before making that specific buy , do some homework and wherever possible , seek out a store where you can actually see the watches in person . being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase . find the best price , and pull the model out and actually try it on before you buy . for me , the highgear summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package , try the highgear axis , or possibly the more stylish but much more compact ( and way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing a little homework will pay off in the end . happy hiking and i hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product . good luck
1	it is a very good product . works extremely well when you using it while exercising . really makes you drip of sweat from your waist area
1	great way to get rid of stress in the office . suction cup bottom works extremely well .
1	i had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above-average sized cranium . the bell triton was it . it fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it . i would recommend it for anyone with a good-sized head on their shoulders
1	let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/nba/wnba/cba fan . i picked up this basketball and started dribbling it . i was amazed at two things . first of all , it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs . you can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors . second of all , the grip of the basketball is very good , so it wo n't slip out of your hands . this has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that does n't slip out of my hands . to wrap things up , i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with spalding and buy this basketball
1	i really like this bike . it 's great . the only complaint i have is with amazon.com customer service . the bike came partly assembled . you really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble . i put the seat and pedals on . the `` quick release '' for the front tire was missing from the box . i called customer service and they could not send me one . she said i would have to send the bike back and get a new one . she could n't even give me the number of the mfg . i was so mad . i did n't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble . i took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on .
0	i guess you get what you pay for . this pedometer was difficult to calibrate , and continued to miscount steps , and therefore distance , covered . it is made of plastic , and came unclipped easily . i am a big person , and have started walking to improve my health . this product does not work for me , although it might be a different story for a slim person . it has been relegated to the junk drawer , and probably will eventually be thrown away . i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it
1	here 's the deal with this item : it 's fine for little girls ( and i suppose , little boys that are inclined to dance ) who have n't been exposed to a better dance game . i got this for christmas for my 5 year old daughter ; she takes dance , likes dancing , has never had or known about another 'dance dance revolution ' game , and she loves it . it 's a big hit ; she 's jumping all over the place , adds up her score at the end of each song , and it 's been a great , cheap gift , with exercise to boot . no , it 's not sophisticated . older kids or teens ( not to mention adults ) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound . for them , get one that goes in their playstation or whatever . however , many 5 year old girls do n't have a playstation , or need one . this is perfect for them . for $ [ ... ] and shipping , it worked out great for a little kid . for a teen , it 's $ [ ... ] wasted . that 's the difference
1	quick shipping/ but poor packaging . there was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main screw and bolts pagackages were already open ( lucky i found all ) bad packaging but excellent bench . it takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in . great multi-function product . you can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition . pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow ( no problems yet ) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping ( another 155 value ) it was really worth it . i say to anyone who likes it , its worth it . just get it . wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass
0	need i say more ? the ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor 's yard . thankfully no one was hurt
1	i 've had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound . i 've tried various types , including the compressible foam , but nothing seems to work all the time . i use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle , under my full face helmet . these plugs work great and are very comfortable . they 're also very easy to remove ( not so the compressed foam , if they 're just a little too far in ) . i 've had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more , including some for my riding buddies to try . my only complaint is that the included case does n't hold up to repeated use - the `` hinge '' just does n't last - but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now .
1	seems to be a good bike . have n't had time to ride it much yet .
0	i figured i 'd give these a shot , since i 've heard good things about them . first off , though , to put these tees in the ground , you have to guide them with a finger ; otherwise , they 'll bend . the control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees . also , because of the sharp edges , there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905r . i would n't recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you do n't want dinged up , unless those extra five yards really mean that much . if you have a slower swing speed than i do , though , ( mine 's about 105-110mph ) the grooves might not be an issue . the only reason that i gave these even two stars is because they last forever . when i was trying them out , i was playing 18 holes , minus the par 3 's , without breaking a single tee . overall , though , they are n't really suited for me as is
1	this is the second vector i have purchased . my first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works . the watch has a large dial and is a little bulky , but you get used to it . you trade that for a large easy to read dial . the watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it . it has the compass , barometer , temperature , and altimeter . the 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather . the watch is a nice instrument , but i would warn against abusing it . it is shock resistant , not shock proof
1	i have used the leatherman micra for years , and thought it was time for a change . the squirt is more money , but very handy , especially now because you do n't have to open the scissors to get at the tools
1	i am very satisfied with the apex chair . i used one many years ago in a gym . i looked on line and found it on amazon.com . apex instructions were very easy to follow . this peace of equipment is very well constructed and is very good for your lower back and abs
0	got my bowflex weeks ago and having trouble , lots of trouble putting it together . it 's not the product 's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha . seems the parts could 've been marked better . identification is pretty much visual . instead , you have a `` picture map '' to compare what part is needed . i was doing fine until i inserted the wrong bolt , stripped the bolt trying to get it out , got the wd40 on it , finally had to use a crescent wrench . so , my confidence is blown and then i continued on to assemble the seat backwards . the assemblage directions could be better , believe me . i used the 800 # once , but i finally found that no matter what was suggested , the picture was misleading and there 's no way that could 've been explained . onward through the fog !
0	i hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item , but just to warn others - i bought this because i wanted an ab bench . it really does n't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells . the ab position is pretty weak and does n't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have , plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said , if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over , get something else . combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable , it really wo n't make an impact on your workouts . i did a few sets of situps and really do n't feel the tightness i would have if i used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter . if you 're on a budget , this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard . the fact that it 's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are one smooth incline , not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it 's not supposed to bend lol
0	i used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely . amazon sent a free replacement . it did the same thing . i could n't get it to turn on , then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on i could n't get it to turn off . it needs major redesigning . i like the concept and it was comfortable but that 's about all . barbara baxte
1	this was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months . i think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to . he has found it so entertaining , and i especially appreciated that in his first months when there was n't a lot i could do with him . now i try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts !
1	this monster is great ... my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already , and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit . we heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor ... luckily she had n't gone to her attorney 's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all ... thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $ 15 + $ 5 shipping we paid for you
0	overall the item works well . if keeping track of one player it is just fine . when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player . to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two
1	i just love this workout , it really gets you sweating . it 's a great workout for beginners as well , not too fast or complicated . i just started working out with the firm system , and plan to use it to get back into shape . you can always purchase more dvd 's to keep you motivated . i recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape .
1	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle . the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store . awesome toy for infants since it 's light , easy to grip , and easy to bit . my son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys
0	they look nice , but they 're badly put together ; i had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month
0	nothing against these particular paddles , but avoid cheap paddles . if you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles . if you paddle , you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one . you can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending . good paddles will make you want to use your kayak
0	just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut ... ..once in a while amazon gets it right ! had a very bad experience before christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter . after being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to christmas ... .on an `` in stock '' item , 5 days prior to christmas , i was notified that item was out of stock and i would n't receive it ... panic mode ! i sent an unsolicited e-mail complaint to amazon . my response was pretty much sorry , but amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker , and do n't actually inventory ... ..what ! i noticed that they did n't ask for a review of my experience on that one ! ! but my son did get his b-ball this time ... .and if it was n't for him , i would have never done business with amazon again ! this review probably does n't meet the guidelines and undoubtedly wo n't be posted
0	i am in the same boat ... stupid..i should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price..i paid about $ 45 on ebay ... and then it came stright from amazon and no dvd ... i called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund ... what a pain ... i told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd ... false advertising ... oh well live and learn ... ball does seem pretty small once i aired it up ... i think i will look else where for a differnt name brand ball . and yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out..arms hurt etc
1	my daughter loves this toy . it 's brightly colored and she loves the honking legs . the tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster i really do n't see how a child could strangle themselves with it .
0	the gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter
1	i was really impressed with this nascar sleeping bag . i purchased it for my nephew who recently turned 5 . he 's a big nascar fan and he was super thrilled to have this .
1	this inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it 's light wheight . once inflated , it 's easy to carry with just one arm when empty . it also has a very sturdy feel once it 's completely inflated ( i would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger ) . with both seats in the kayak , there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear . i have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes . we generally carry two fishing rods , gear box , bottled water , and other related items , along with a dry bag . even with all this `` stuff '' in the boat there is plenty of room inside , and with the seats in place i have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling . i have n't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so i 'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario
1	yea man soon as i got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great b-bal
0	purchased three of these at christmas . horns and lights did not work on but one , another was missing keys when delivered , luckily interchangable . within 5 days , one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit , the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere , and the third had two bald tires which burst ! all this before the new year turned . i contacted the company , and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail . however , they offered no assistance on actual repair , telling me that `` any man can do it with a few tools '' . after several hours and a visit to the tire shop , i fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now . i obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive . i would buy at a store where i could take back if needed . good luck .
0	this gun did n't work from the moment my son took it out of the box . the return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so i did n't bother . it went straight to the trash can
1	the plastic side mounts ( 4 ) appear to be solid and not flimsy . i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones , ( you know , since this is going on a boat ! ) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless . the package says `` includes all stainless mounting fasteners '' so i guess that means hooks only . the supplied screws are not even galvanized . so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat , go get stainless screws that are also 1/2 '' longer than the ones provided . all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get
0	do n't order this item or anything from mercantilla inc . the product was a different color than advertised , it was missing three important parts , without which you ca n't use the bench , and many of the other parts were damaged . i 've never had this many problems from any of amazon 's sellers . this was supposed to be my holiday present , but it turned out to be a real disappointment .
0	i bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun . i go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it . i know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous , and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up
0	this was the 2nd dvd with problems that i bought from this vendor . the first dvd had 2 sections where the dvd would pause but would continue playing , and i was willing to live with it . bootcamp/muscle endurance , on the other hand , would not play the muscle endurance workout at all ! i contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my dvd player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'open ' dvds only to 'better suite my needs ' . i own 20+ workout dvds and none of them gave me any problems like this one did . the dvd is also fairly pricey and so i 'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them . i was able to play the bootcamp workout until towards the end ( before the cool down section ) where it would not continue playing . i like cathe 's workout very much . the part of bootcamp that i was able to play was excellent ! but i am very disappointed with this vendor
1	the cold steel spike tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price . it is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily . it has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size i have ever seen . virtually indestructible . the case is excellent if plain . this knife leaves very wide wounds in steak ; i think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds . on the down side it does n't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and i wear a medium glove . overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense . it is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain . it is a knife that wo n't let you down when the going gets tough , used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient .
0	it 's not that bad of a product , considering how cheap it is . however i have three definite criticisms . one , it is n't very stable . when your doing dips , it 's pretty wobbly . two , the pull-up bar is n't far enough away from the crossbars , so if your body swings at all during your pull-ups , it 's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar . and three , the push up bars are totally usless . you can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar .
1	this knife 's single blade , a bottle opener , nail file , and two flat-head screwdrivers ( one large , one small ) come packed in a slimline aluminum case . there 's a can opener , too -- though i 've never tried to use it -- and a panel on one side that can be engraved . it 's an elegant package and lightweight . once you 're used to this little buddy , you wo n't want to carry the standard red plastic version . the only caveat : do n't take this to the airport . it will be confiscated . note : to avoid losing it , you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end . with this , a woman can attach her knife to her purse , and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done . a man can attach the chain to a belt loop . until i did this , i had several `` walk '' after lending them to someone who needed a knife `` just for a minute . ''
1	i just ordered a pair of these for my son , since my daughter is so pleased with them . the wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly . the wheels roll very smoothly . the velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support , and is easier to adjust than just laces . a fun outdoor activity ! laurie , mother of emma ( 8 ) and kevin ( 11
1	i just got my poles , and while they seem great in other ways , they do not offer the soft antishock system as the description says they do
0	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine . unfortunetly , the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical . i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
1	initially i had some trouble figuring out the right port to use . but now it works and i 've used it constantly for at least 2 years
1	i have to say that i love this mat . the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip . only thing is ... the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat . haha . weird , huh ? so now you know . other than that the mat is visually very pleasing
0	the bike i ordered wouldve been a great christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before i received it , both fenders damaged badly , and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots
1	i have recently purchased this item . i think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube
0	at first i was very happy with this stroller . i love the big wheels , the front one which swivels . the cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby . and the adjustable handle is awesome because i 'm short and i can push the stroller at a comfortable height . also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs , steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall , museum , park , or on city streets . one of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back . there is a drawstring that you must adjust . this requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative . despite this , i still loved the stroller until recently . however , after only two months of use , my stroller will not lock . it has actually folded up on my son while pushing it . i now can not even seem to lock it into the open position for use . i have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open . and because the stroller folds outward , not inwards like an umbrella stroller , it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out . this is very dangerous . i am contacting the manufacturer about this defect
0	when i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought . i havent used them since i bought them ... i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange , but i havent heard a thing from them . i 'm not very pleased .
1	looks like this is what i need for short hikes . a little on the heavy side , but good for day hikes
0	very lightweight , fragile , and poorly finished . not sure what the `` hardwood '' actually is . it looks oak-like , but is far too lightweight for it 's size . it came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time . the lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off . i only used it for kata ; did n't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills . after a few months of very little use , mostly sitting on the rack , it began to develop cracks . perhaps it was n't dried properly when they applied the finish ? regardless , the one i received ( 50 '' model ) was cheap junk . you get what you pay for ... not only not recommended , but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it . spend a little more to get better quality
1	this table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel . we go airplane camping in a piper super cub so lightweight , compact and sturdy is a must for us . it comes in a handy travel bag . it 's a great table at a great price
1	i was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty . the only problem i had was the bar on the rear-bottom would n't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in . i tried really hard to get it in , but it just would n't budge . luckily , i could get the screw in on the other end , so it is relatively secure . the bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now i do n't know if this is because of my problem with the bar , or because that 's just the way it is . but i do n't feel like it 's going to fall apart or tip over or anything . over all , this is a really nice bike . the price is absolutely the best for what you 're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping . i got mine about a week from the day i ordered it . i do n't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price . most recumbent bikes at this price do n't offer any kind of resistance , what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor . it is really quiet - i can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the tv up too loud . the seat is a bit uncomfortable , but it 's not that big of a deal considering the price
1	these cars can be summed up in two words fun and loud . i have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends . they work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well . i am even thinking of getting a third . they do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily . well worth it .
0	received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly . 5 days after emailing the company , they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and i must return it to them before they will send out a new box . very frustrating- i must drive 20 miles to the nearest ups store to return it . wish i had just bought the thing at walmart
0	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw . the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side ; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys . this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw . so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !
1	i originally bought the blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) and the black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys . the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger . the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it . it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light , this makes it good for use anytime , anywhere . ( i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever ) if i had to do it again , i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip , probably have started with the red . just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping , the challenge is working out the fingers . it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers . it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts . great product , excellent for finger or hand exercise , good quality
1	i 've been using these gloves for 3 years now and i had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers . what i like : easy to set good wrist support good grip with the middle bar what i do n't like : using wraps can be difficult if you do n't take a size above and i recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin . for the price and the time that i 've used them ( 2-3 times a week on heavy bags ) , they performed very well
1	this is the second time that i purchased this backpack . the first time was over 5 years ago when my son was starting highschool . now he is a 2nd year student in college and it is time to replace the original one . why not get the bag that has lasted so long
0	the pogo stick that i ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail . i have to say though that the return was easy . the company had ups come to my house and pick up the product and i was given a full refund immediatly . the item was not great ... but customer service was good
0	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles , and pins while camping , then this is the item for you . the instructions are made only to confuse things more . it could be made so much more user friendly . once it 's up , it gets a thumbs up .
0	absolutely no use to me whatsoever . next
0	i was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles . unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat . and it took me all morning to get it put together . the holes for the straps to go into were so small i had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well . the screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short , and the washers needed to be pried together . finally i was nearing the final steps , when lo and behold , i was missing a piece . i call customer support , which is at bell , not fisher price or mattel . i was on hold for 20 minutes before i was able to speak to anyone . then when i spoke to the representative , she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes . this happened twice . their solution to my missing piece ? use a zip tie , `` we do n't ship that piece separately . '' excuse me ? you make a mistake , you fix it . regardless of whether or not `` the piece is shipped separately . ridiculous . and at the end of the conversation , there was no apology offered , no attempt to make the situation right . ugh . so now , i have nothing to show for my morning of effort . also , i attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter . i sat her in the seat , and she barely fits . she is two years old , barely weighs 23 pounds , and is tiny . i have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat . i had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years . that would not happen with this seat . so , it is going back to the store , and i am buying a kettler flipper , or a bobike maxi , or a topeak . i will steer clear of bell products in the future ! oh , and to top it all off , the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging ! ! worthless . save your time and your money , avoid this seat at all costs
0	i bought both the ark iii and the super ark . the super ark is a slight improvement over the ark iii but i would never recommend people buy either one . there are far better entry-level kits , for just a few dollars more , available from other sources . the ark iii contains 24 oz . of water , a food bar , and a small , inexpensive emergency blanket in a kleenex-sized cardboard box . i 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits i subsequently purchased . i 'm surprised - and disappointed - amazon carries these products
1	it 's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices . it 's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle . i like : * not having to tip your head up to drink , since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - i 've never seen this design before * easy to flip open with one hand , yet you do n't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs * absense of taste compared to plastic bottles i do n't like : * diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way . it takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it does n't go further . it has n't flown out during riding yet , but i am looking for a wider cage now ( not easy to find ) . why not make it standard diameter for bike cages
0	did n't pump any air into the tire the first 2 `` stomps '' ... tried it again another day , 3rd `` stomp '' and the gauge went flying off . put the gauge back on and it still does n't work . biggest waste of money . never even filled one tir
0	this product is ineffective . the snorkel gets stuck , either open so that water pours in while you 're trying to breathe , or stuck shut so you can not take a breath of air while under water . it 's is very distressing when you 're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform ! i often take in mouthfuls of water , or worse ; suck for a breath of air and get nothing ! it is therefore useless , i stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good . i bought two sets , one for my partner and one for myself , and they both fail to perform . the mask on one set broke after 2 months ( the metal pin became dislodged ) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet . the bag 's zippers rusted not long after use ... given that most people snorkel in salt water , you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal . overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad . we both felt awkward snorkeling with them , and sometimes i even felt they were hazardous . we tossed these products and bought cressi brand gear . it has changed our underwater experience
0	when i got this gun , i thought it looked really cool , but when i tried to shoot it , the bullets just rolled out of the barrell ! the few bullets that did shoot worked well . i did not have a good experience with this gun
0	i take yoga in a gym . the class starts as the aerobics session ends . i bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class . using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot . i expected more elastic . they made my foot cramp during the class . because i had worn them once i could not return them . now i do not know what to do with them . i should throw them out but i spent money on them
1	i bought this for myself to play with ( i 'm 35 ) and after all the presents were opened and toys , video games , and everything were forgotten ( about 4 hours after christmas ) , this was the ongoing favorite of the season . everybody , younger ( down to 8 ) and older ( to 45 ) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching . it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such . this is a great present for 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there will be some good spills on the fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , are a must ( and a video camera !
0	i just saw this toy in parents magazine sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at target this week . i ran to get it since my [ ... ] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle . it looked like lots of fun in the picture , however , my son is too big for it ! i do n't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way ! if it were adjustable , i 'm sure he would have loved it , but just like another reviewer stated- it 's just like the other ride-on toys we already own . currently , the scuttle bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store . how disappointing
0	i am a huge ski person and i got the jump it is so small for me because i am do like 50 feet drops all the time . ___________________my suggestion___________________ this is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things . not ideal what so ever for skiing . i got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard not skiing
0	i was just looking at tennis rackets , on the amazon site . the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one . i did not press to conferm this order , but amazon kept my credit card details on record and used them . nicola bradle
1	i use the ir interface with the polar s625x running computer , and i have never encountered a single problem . i usually use the interface in to different computers , a notebook at home ( with xp ) , and a desktop at work ( 2000 ) , and in both computers it works nicely . you have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the ir interface . install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer . i love my polar watch , and the ir interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product .
1	this is exactly what i was looking for . i had a very similar roller at my gym ( club one ) and loved it , but left the gym a while ago . a previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment . do n't worry , it comes with it , and it works perfectly . i interchange standard-sized weights all the time ... have tested with up to 30lbs ( 30lbs is killer on your wrists , and i 'm a fairly strong man ) if you want a gym-quality wrist roller , buy this now
0	to say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement . it is basically unuseable ! i wound up throwing it aside the first time i tried it out . a complete waste of money
1	i really like this bike . it feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology . the look is great and draws a lot of attention . it is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst i have ever seen with any product . i basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike , it is hard to believe how poorly they are written . i was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions . after i got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and i had to spend $ 30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted ; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work . the guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right ( two trips for me ) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust . after all that was done i love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted , shifts and brakes very nicely . the ride is comfortable and i love the seat and location of the handlebars . i would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box . my suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills . i also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment ; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up
0	this sounds very stupid , i 'm sure , but i ca n't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery . i unscrew it with a coin as i 'm told , but when i ca n't turn it with the coin anymore , i still ca n't get the darn thing open
0	the velcro belt tore off after the second use ! within a week of purchase ! the material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight
0	i love the idea of this ... sleek , out of the way for transit but readily available on the road , protected when not in use . unfortunately , the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety . because of the narrowness of the mirror , it 's very difficult to focus on what is actually behind you with a quick glance . sure , if you sit there for 10 seconds you can figure it out , but i do n't have that sort of time when i 'm dodging through chicago traffic ! save your money and buy the excellent mirrcycle instead
0	this is not the fault of amazon or even the product . i wasused to a gym quality rower ( conceptii ) which allows a lot of resistance . the integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance . i am in the process of sending it back . the machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge . an expensive lesson
0	if i could give them 0 stars , i would . i do n't know why they even still make these , as they should be illegal -- and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate . the materials break up easily ; the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place . i could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior , but complete garbage right out of the box . everlast in general simply is n't good : low quality materials , design and workmanship , but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book . i recommend buying entirely ringside -- and this is coming from an experienced full-contact fighter
0	in my opinion , this thing is flimsy and worthless . i set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just does n't hold . once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up , you realize that you 've already thrown away your money and now it 's time to throw away this product . i absolutely agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision
1	the bar is very solid and has a good looking chrome finish . it takes olympic weight plates ( 2 inch diameter . ) the shipping and packaging are good too . overall , i have no complaint with this purchase . i would recommend this bar
0	seems i may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while i was doing exercise and heard a pop now it spins all the time i use it - not happy : ( i did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
1	i bought this machine because of the low price , and i was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile . however , i was very pleasantly surprised . it is a great machine , especially for beginners who want upper body workouts . if you 're a serious athlete , or if you want leg exercises , this may not be the best machine for you . for me , it is working out great , and i have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises i want . at first , i was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble , but they went together very quickly and easily , and all the tools are included . be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms , or 264 pounds . great product
1	blackburn racks are getting harder to find , but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength / weight . i have had blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint . one is still going strong after 20 years . highly recommended
0	the ir link for the polar hear monitors is great . it allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your pc : you can download your exercise data , and also change the settings for the watch from the computer . this is great , because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons . the biggest problem with the ir link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer . for whatever reason , polar decided not to pay bill gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with microsoft . when installing the driver from the included cd , warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding , which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have . there is no updated version available for download from the internet . i went ahead and installed the driver , but since doing so , the computer has not been functioning properly , and i 've been getting those `` send error report / do n't send error report '' pop-ups from windows . polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is `` fine '' for use . i 'm no computer expert , so i do n't know for sure , but i do n't believe them
1	i purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80 's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs . my dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter . my mother does some treadmill walking . they really enjoy using these bands and i think it is benefiting them . they are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it
0	nice looking skates , but very stiff boot and runs too small . do n't like the stiffness of the boot . will not buy another rd product
1	this case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel . the good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole . the bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase . but that 's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment
0	the handles on these knives , while having good balance , are the weak point . these knives are n't meant to be thrown . after minimal use they broke - at the handle
0	this gun was okay when i first started using it . it 's really a backyard gun , and should only be used for beginners . i had it on my bed , which is about two feet high , and it fell when my dog jumped on , the barrel broke . the spring in the magazine also broke . there are better guns out there , but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard , this is the gun for you . the sight is a pretty nice feature .
0	they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading : 1 . `` usually ships in 24 hours '' . it actually took 1 week to ship it . 2 . when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have `` leather band '' . the band was made of artificial materials ( nylon and rubber ) or something like that . i will have to return it
0	yes , you 'll feel your muscles contracting . if they were really contracting to a degree worthy of being called exercise , the contractions would scare the heck out of you : you 'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you 'd be going into an spastic , involuntary crunch . do n't worry , that wo n't happen . the machine is n't strong enough . ( try this : tense up your abs..more..a little more ... relax and do it again a few times , for a minute or so ... thats already way more exercise than you 'll get from the 'ab sonic ' . ) if you 're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness , perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program . if your spinal cord is severed , this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation ... fine . this is not exercise . it may 'remind ' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob , but why not just remind -yourself- ? it 's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening , and even if it was , it by-passes the most important part of your workout : the will . you are n't learning the effort of tensing the muscles , or tolerating greater stress , you 're just electronically agitating the muscles . in the end , this has zero effect on strength , muscular development , work tolerance , and function . are you in therapy ? no ? then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body
0	the only satisfaction i have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent . if the price seems too cheap , it is . where to begin ? instructions , pretty bad . hardware , missing , inconsistent , inadequate . design , deeply flawed . mounting , not on my standard mountain bike . manufacture , cheap , cheap , cheap . what result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work ? i 'll spare you the suspense , it did n't . not a glimmer .
1	i am very happy with my choice . it is just the right size , nicely finished with glossy black paint , installs in a minute . usage is very convenient : it has that perfect click-into-place property : you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the `` stand '' position . to `` hide '' it when you are ready to go , just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame . it does the job perfectly and it feels great
0	our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button ( making the toy unusable ) , i bought another one . would n't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later ? this toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion ... the manufacturer needs to correct this problem
0	i did n't like these at all . the toes are too pointy and would n't fit . might be ok for younger children than stated .
1	i have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time . first time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that i just purchased . my reaction ... wow . great tool for golfers at all skill levels . the information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances . i found the intelligreen feature extremely useful . i was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before i would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green . the target lists were consistent with the features i was concerned about on most holes . if anything , i found the target list to contain too many items i found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to sky golf make it easier . be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely . your internet browser must be set to allow cookies from sky golf . otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses . the variety of plans for course downloads is adequate , but i wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic `` par '' sky player course download plan with the purchase of the unit . others have complained about quality and construction . i do n't know what their standards are , but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material . bottom line , if you can afford it and you 're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play ... then this product is for you .
0	this will work only if you are doing work outs , while you are not doing work outs if you wear this , i do n't think it would be of any help .
0	i was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink . so i bought these skates . at the time , it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates . well , now i know i should have spent more and at least be happy with what i purchased . i had such a hard time skating with these skates , and when i talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online ( there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates ) i realized these skates were made for beginning kids , never a 36 year old mom ! they are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do . in fact , i could n't even turn . i kept having to push off because they would slow down . i kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me , and forget it ! i 'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent
1	three things to consider in a yoga block : size , material , color . this thing is purple = ugly . the material is foam , and this block will still be around 1 million years after i die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork , for double the price , of course . finally , i like the size of this block , most blocks are 3x5x9 , this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable
0	this gun broke in the first few used . when i called for service , they inisted on waiting for the tech , and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun cost . overall ... this was a writeoff
1	i like this whistle 's slim design . i wear it when shopping in rough areas . if i am apprehended , i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant . this whistle is much louder than my voice , and carries well across other sounds .
0	not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly . must have been stuck in the box too long ! ... .husband said ... send it back ! needless to say , we got a refund
0	i bought this ear plugs , are uncomfortable , my ears hurt , and in the first use , just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc , are better
1	i use this radar `` gun '' to see how fast my shot is in lacrosse..it works perfectly..there is no use in buying one over 200 dollers ... i mean , its a radar gun ... it is worth your money :
0	due to lack of space , and in need of activity i have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity . this one i bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price ( of course ) , the flexbands with counter . very limited documentation , it does n't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet , i figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device . and then it sarted to make craking noises . so i used some olive oil on the joints that passed . then the suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which i could n't evade at all . while experirmenting the device , the electronic part got loose , it was attached with a soo thin cable , one touch and the cable was torn off . ok i said that was my fault , i should n't have touched it . but ... today , the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart . that is so suprizing , i am only 80 kg , and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes ... very bad construction . ok ... why i gave 2 stars ? the flexicables worked really well . that deserves a point .
0	when one trips the safety key , one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again . this action looses all the time and distance information . the keys fitness , who manufactures ironman and a bunch of others , help line confirmed that this is normal for their products . i see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body
0	the goal arrived at my house assembled wrong , then after it was fixed be me , i successfully put it together , which was relativly easy . after several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net . that is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak . the weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post . overall , this is probably not a good buy .
1	i purchased the kwik kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with . it was fairly easy to put together and , once the base is filled with sand ( it can not be filled with water ) , it 's simple to move it from place to place . the kwik kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs ! i love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors , so he 'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year . great product
1	i had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it . just recently i saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation . it is easy to set up and very stable . we will use it for picnics as well as an additional table on our deck . the carry bag is another plus . no more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler .
0	only heats the palm of your hand , fingers stay cold . no elements in the fingers of the glove , only heating element is in the palm of your hand . not worth the money ,
1	i love this machine . the strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported . the only draw-back is the retraction process sometimes i have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in . other then that b e a utifu
0	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit . i am sending the gps i just purchased , along with this software , back to amazon . the software will not communicate with the gps , and the company will not respond to any of my support requests , the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available , and the live technical support is a complete joke . after 20 minutes of being on hold , i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english , and offered me no help ... i knew more about the software than him , and i 've only owned it 3 days . i 'll never purchase from magellan again
0	the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and could n't be used . a new one had to be purchased
0	placed the order on 11/20 , delivery was supposed to be by 12/9 . on about 12/1 i contacted the company that amazon said was the provider , unbeatable sale , inc. to verify that they did have the order . unbeatable said that it was an amazon order , period , and gave me a number at amazon to contact . amazon said that unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first . cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at walmart .
1	it is very well made . works very well for our use.we are into model rockets.we keep our motors in the box.fills our needs great . steven rushin
0	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know . besides , it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! ( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 . for example , i own a 3-9x44 scope . this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom . the second number refers to the size of the scope lens . i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one . also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail . if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight ( peephole )
1	this gun is a good gun after the first charge . the problems are : the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver , the laserr is in accurate . thats all thats worrng . good things are : after the first charge its powerfull and accurate . its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit . its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks . its just a good gun , nothing special
1	let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect . it is , in fact , flawed . as you may have noticed , i still gave it a five star rating and i will try to explain the reasons for doing so . reading the reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out that this machine does n't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine . i researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while . i spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money . during my research , it became very evident that my favorite rower is a water rower followed by schwinn 's windrigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation . both were also about $ 1000 ! at any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the integrity and it should surprise nobody that the integrity does n't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers . and it should n't , given it substantially lower price . and this is exactly what it important in considering this rower : you can not expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you can not expect to get the comfort and performance of a rolls royce if you are buying a honda . nonetheless , what you do get from integrity is well within the parameters of what i would expect for about $ 200 . the machine is reasonably stable , it is reasonably smooth , and it does provide a great workout . the noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the windrigger . the electric monitor is basic and provides speed , time , calories burned , and distance . it also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout . the seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and does n't appear flimsy . i was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the schwinn windrigger . in addition , resistance can be adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw i can live with . as a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface . as i said before , i also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower . i can not confirm this problem . assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest . however , it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where . winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze , too . all you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before . i suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as i said , the instructions are not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price . it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner . however , as with any product , your expectations should be realistic and if they are , you will not be disappointed . if you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for . if , however , you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products , then this is probably the best deal you can get
1	the table appeared to be exactly expected regarding quality . the shipment was also timely . unfortunately , we had to return the table as `` the style was not quite right '' for the situation of our game room
0	i did get a nice little buzz the first two days i took this product , and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out . you can push yourself a bit further at the gym . the gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product . it was n't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it . i had no lasting weight loss when taking it , just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later . i 'd skip it
0	the overall steel frame and structure of it is good , but there are too many flaws with this product , i recommend going with something else . flaws : 1 ) bands do not give you good increments of resistence . if you want even resistance on each side , you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting , which is crazy . 2 ) workout and assembly manuals are terrible . especially the workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated ? what does that really say about how much stamina cares about people using it correctly , without injury , and getting good benefit out of it ? only about 10 exercises are really shown , the rest are just single pictures that let 's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do , except that many are for some other machine , not this one . i 'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use . 3 ) many of the pictures are misleading , such that you ca n't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures . one customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine . ridiculous . 4 ) several construction pieces i received were bad and caused problems , but replacement parts were shipped with no problem , albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one , and then time to reconstruct the machine . i had to replace the main rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong . 5 ) leg padding is inadequate and painful 6 ) does n't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by stamina , no one i called seems to use it or really can tell you about it . for a company that claims to care about health and fitness , they really do n't show it with this product or support for this product . i 'd go elsewhere .
1	i just bought the speedbelt 2 , deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me . so far , the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range . it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle . for longer runs , i 'd suggest the 4-bottle belt , but this one is great for the intermediate range . the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all . recommended
1	this lunch box is top quality , with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two . the quality is superior and i highly recommend it . there is an area for your flatwear , salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks . there is even a compartment for your soda . i have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it . great for travel , work and picnics for two
1	this may be the 'outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it 's big , it 's ugly , but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy . overall , i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are . the timepiece : outstanding . it has hh : mm : ss dd : mmm , of course , with a year setting to avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying in a modern digital watch . stopwatch with lap function ( not that i ever use the lap function , but i 'm sure someone is interested ) . countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown ( very easy to set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos for the alarms , this is one of the loudest watch alarms i 've heard , and i 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this . the altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind of neat . over four days , my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level ( by the maps , about 40m asl ) . not surprising because it is driven by the barometer , and i never recalibrated it , but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it . the barometer : yup , it 's a barometer . the part i like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend , especially as this is always active ( even in normal 'time ' mode ) . the thermometer : take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist . the compass : easily the best 'special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough for orienteering , not for surveying ) , easy to use . it can be programmed for a declination , but knowing me , i 'd forget to reset it , so i do declination the hard way . the sighting notches are small but servicable . the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto , and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass . an outstanding wrist compass . the package : big . really , really big . but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing ( a problem for me with other watches ) . the battery has a shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but has a hatch , so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance . the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground , and the display light is just right , readible , even , and glare free , but not an emergency flashlight . personally , i 'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap , but the stock strap is n't bad , just not great . overall , not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch , compass and barometer , and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter . well designed , thought-out , and manufactured , but really big .
0	do n't buy these cards . they are of very low quality . i bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked . you will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards .
1	i bought this product to use during my camping trips . i had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately , great customer service . this is a really neat hammock , it packs really small but is very resistant . my friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up . you will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard
0	be sure you have a very flat , smooth surface for these bumper cars . there is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car . our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway . we had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface . these are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court .
1	the pedometer is just too sensitive ! ! it tends to over state the number of steps that i have taken . i like the item but i cut the number of steps that i have taken by third . so , if i am tageting 10,000 steps a day i try to go 13,333 so that i can be sure that i really hit my target . the item itself is well made , light weight and easy to use and set .
1	as the 'blow up ' float toys come and go , the sea breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float . the only problem is sharing . we love it
0	overall , the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement . the most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench . it is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press . second , the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands . there is no way around this other than narrowing your grip . the fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support . the lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which i am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time . the weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session .
1	neoprene pouch keeps water cool , but it has a very strong displeasing smell , kind of like used motoroil , which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle . so you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it .
0	this case is mainly made of plastic ! ! do n't be fooled by the `` aluminum '' description , only the corners were aluminum , the rest just painted plastic . the case came poorly packaged ! the box was too small for the case . the case had scuff marks , and scratches on it . obviously not brand new ! ! this was the worst purchase i 've ever made on amazon . will never buy adg sports again ! ! ! their label was crooked on the case too ! ! looks like a 4-year-old put it on ! ! do n't waste your money ! trust me ! !
0	living in florida i bought two of these everlight flashlights . the party that said there was enough charge during shippins is a little shaking in the head . it takes at least a couple of minutes of of shaking before there is even a glimmer of light . after that if you do n't continue to shake it dies out very rapidly . this light may possibly come in handy during a hurricane power failure but there are other led flashlights with batteries that are superior to this one . the power used by these leds is low and the batteries last a long time .
1	we looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet , and this one was by far the best for its price .
0	for one , the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps . secondly they spelled enhanced `` enchanced . '' they may have even done this on purpose , seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun . it 's about 50/50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition
0	my daughter loves it . you wants to practice more often now . thank
1	the item was delivered quickly . as advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine . i would purchase again from this supplier
1	outstanding design . secure , heavy duty , super easy to load , very protective of the bikes . best possible design for older or limited users
0	i ordered this sleeping bag on 12/07/06 , i chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days . this was more then enough time i needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before christmas . here it is 01/10/07 , and still the sleeping bag has not arrived . my account says it was shipped on 12/11/06 . when i track the item it says expected delivery date is 01/31/07 . nothing was ever stated when i placed the order that the delivery date would be 01/31/07 . only 3 - 5 days . this is the most ridiculous thing i ever heard ! i had other items placed with this order that i have received off and on out of the blue before and after christmas . there are 3 all together that i never received at all from target . i counted on these items for christmas and i am very disappointed with amazon and target . i have done alot of business with amazon and in the future i will never , never give any of my business to amazon if the order is connecrted to target in any way ! ! ! ! target amazon deserve 0 stars for terrible service , and false advertisement !
0	i was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when i bought it . assembly was not so bad ( 2.5 hours ) . then the squeeking started . just about after 100 calories burned , there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel . we called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day ( he needed to respond before 5 days ) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days after that . the technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal , and adjusted the tension on some screws and left . now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout . it is loud . as in , you need earplugs , loud . another call to tech support ...
0	we found the system very hard to read . at night we could n't see it at all to read it . our family bought us the better model for xmas , so we are going to put this one on ebay . would not recommend it
1	i bought this for my brother , he loved it ! i was worried that it is a little big , but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff : - ) he said it was just right
0	be forwarned , that this is more for isolated toning legs , arms , shoulders.hips , rather than pilates workout . does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them . the trainer on the dvd has flabby abs , and thick torso , rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts . i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use , hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center , very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set . and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs , after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer . it is not up to the caliber of what i have come to expect from pilates . also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment , as equipment kept slipping down or up . need to go back to the drawing board on this one , there are better , less expensive , better made options out there , with better training . keep on looking .
1	this really is a cool , pedal-free bike . we got it for our three-and-a-half-year-old , and he really likes it . friends of ours ( with more disposable income ) bought their daughter a like-a-bike , which is about twice the price . i have yet to discover any big difference in performance . the like-a-bike is certainly nice-looking , if a bit precious , since it is constructed primarily out of wood . the kettler looks fine , however -- more like a `` real '' bike , in fact , and less like a museum piece . the only reasons i would n't give the kettler five stars are : 1. you need to assemble it , and the instructions are not great ( my husband , who is generally a handy guy , managed to get it together , but not without some swearing ) 2. the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires
0	i was so happy to order this . it has n't even been put together yet ... in box for two weeks . they sent the wrong hardware with it . i emailed them 2 times and got no response . after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice . she was nice and shipped the parts . they arrived today and guess what ? the same wrong parts again . i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together . at least i have a list from the owner 's manual . overall experience was a big fat bust
0	i bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when i rode on vacation when i assembled the trailer , the chain was twisted . i bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it . then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel . the sprocket was badly bent . i bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel . by the time i got it all working , my vacation was over . by the time i see my granddaughter again , she 'll have her own bike . i 'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to
0	the first time i used it , i hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods . my mom had ordered it from sharper image . she called them and they said the would replace the ball . they never did . i have not found a place to order replacement parts .
0	front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced . box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way . i replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup . the gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth . i did n't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there would n't be other expenses down the road to deal with so i decided to return the bike and buy something local i can get a look at before we buy
0	i am not a big spender , but unlike a lot of things , the more money you spend , the better bike you get . i really did n't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old , and i wish i would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop . i 'm so frugal that i could n't stand the idea of paying $ 140 for a bike for a kid , so i got this one instead ( which was actually more expensive when i bought it . ) this is a mediocre bike at best , maybe one step above a big box store bike , just maybe . i wanted a simple bike that would last while , but i will be surprised if this one makes it one summer . paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box . the components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid . the difference between this one and a good ( expensive ) bike is huge . i had a bike shop put it together and i added a basket , so the difference between what i paid for this and what i would have paid for a good bike was about $ 30 . i 'm kicking myself now .
0	i bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks ( over $ 1,000 ) for recommended models , hoping to make an exclusion from the rule . no , it did not happened . starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual , inaccurate display readings , and so on , ending with a squicky and noisy piece of ... equipment . their customer service is just a place to order parts , although they sent me some parts i broke when assemling - a threat on the bolt , a couple of broken ( by me ) plastic part . i noticed that i 'm using this machine more rarely because i just do n't like the way it works . if i new what i was going to get , i did not buy it
1	this skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a `` santa '' gift ... the hit of the day ! although she has n't had much opportunity to use them yet , she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine . they are nice looking and fit is true to size
0	when i first time used it , it 's borken . and i can not return or exchange without bo
0	this pedometer is so cheap it is n't worth the $ 1.88 pricetag . unless you want to cheat yourself , this is not the pedomter for you . you gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants , then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine i gained about 30 steps . by the end of my work day i had apparently walked 11,953 steps that i mostly acquired turning in my office chair , and i wo n't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car . on top of all this , the company would n't refund me on the pedometers i ordered for my co-workers
1	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising , selected the armband carrier . it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for . occassionally , you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm , but it holds the ipod firmly in place . it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device . if you sweat a great deal while you exercise , i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine . would recommend it to anyone who asks
0	not worth the shipping cost . completely flawed . i ordered the oregon scientific , which is perfect . should be zero stars . dr. parha
1	good machine - excellent price - purchase shipping but remember ! you got ta get on the thing and do the work
1	allright , thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for . its accurate , and its an incredible price . its pretty hard hitting . i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away . im not new to airsoft , and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends , i reccommend extra clips . the mag capacity is about 45 , and the load time is annoyingly long a very good gun for all abilitie
0	i bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching tv ... i wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive . what it boils down to is that this is a `` foot hook '' tied to a bar with a nylon strap . the nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly . the idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches ... the problem is that the nylon strap does n't actually hold your feet down . i wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room . negative on both accounts . you need a good sturdy door to implement this product , and then it still does n't truly hold your feet down . looks like i 'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down
0	... for more than a couple of minutes ( no matter what i did ) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink . overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke . i 've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
1	i bought this sword on the 25'th of december . got it on the 27'th of december . paid for standard shipping . amazing delivery time ! the sword is amazing too ! thanks for the great product x-bows , i will be coming back to you soon
1	i actually bought this for my husband . he loves it , it has a lot of great features . the only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate .
0	i was surprised when i received what appeared to be a sales brochure . i searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if i had missed the book entirely , but in fact the small , clumsily put together manual was in fact the $ 3.75 book that i bought online . it has some new exercises in it , but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them .
0	i saw this design and thought it was a great idea . after using it twice my wrists still hurt . now i know why i could n't find this design at my local sporting goods store
1	i bought this for my son ( recommended by his special ed teacher ) and the whole family has been using it ever since . it 's a nice , sturdy , trampoline and it 's not too expensive . the `` folding '' part is a little disappointing which i why it 's not getting full stars . however , we have n't needed to use that feature so it was n't that important to us . overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
0	for the price , i should n't complain , but what the heck ? what ever happened to quality control ? it came double shrink wrapped . there was a plastic handle guard that did n't fit the sword , so i had to just throw it away . very little pride in the product . the wood was roughly sanded before it was painted . well , it 's just a stick afterall . i 'm just glad i did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor , dreamobjects . read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback . sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars . i gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you ca n't tell quality from a single digital photo
0	the ab roller was a big disappointment for me . it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts . then , once that project was done , i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me . as a very petite ( 4'11 '' ) woman my hands barely reached the top bar , making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly . so beware shorties out there
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airoft rifle as a christmas gift . the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat ( a shortened m-4 ) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail . yes , i could go out and find screws the proper length , but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job . so , after several e-mails with the service department , they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size . wrong . the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight . obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws . why by a gun from these guys ? if it arrives broken , you pay to ship it back . want a refund ? you pay a 15 % restocking fee . take a pass on airsplat .
0	my friend and i both bought this gun . we both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked . i could throw bb 's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day . in ten minutes only 1 bb came out of the barrel and it just rolled out . it does n't work , 'nuff said . all it 's good for now is to be my back scratcher . buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot bb 's , they will work better than this gun . thank you for your time . good nigh
0	the gloves looked great online but in actually , the quality of the product was not what i imagined . the gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm . instead , it had a thin sheet of nylon . the closure was not secure enough so i was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on . on the bright side , the gloves were pretty and i had no problems returning the product back to amazon.com
1	love this backpack , it 's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well , while protecting the contents well , laptop included . the outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there , and still fit under an airplane seat . love the two water holders on the outside . love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner , compass , or whatever . the support is great , you 'll barely feel its there , and if you do , just use both straps , and then strap the front for great support . the pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens , but thats quite minor . my only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already . i am now on my third backpack ( got ta love rei 's return policy ) . hopefully this one will last as i have yet to find a better more complete backpack . update 1/30/2007 - third backpack , third zipper to get caught , time to return , again . i wish i could change the scale down to 2 stars :
1	i ordered this for my daughter when she played t-ball . she played on the cubs team and it was great . very durable , and adjustable
1	this pair of pistols is quite entertaining . i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months , and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased . dualing spring pistols is a challenge , but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand . they 're flimsy , but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while . definitely worth 16 buck
0	i just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap . but there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate . what is it for , i can twist without it . anyway , 10 mins after using the machine i got a severe knee injury . i didnt have an injury before using it but i got one now . i am going to have to get rid of it .
0	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke . it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand . also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks . the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too . the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken . i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit . anyone , honestly , that tells you differently is wrong
0	i do n't think i have ever run across a more overpriced , flimsy piece of camping gear ; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from coleman was rather a shock . the first time i opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site . too late : the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping . i looked closer , and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap , delicate plastic . this thing would n't have lasted a day on a campsite , even if it had survived shipping ! ( we placed the table in the campsite 's trash dumper the next morning ) . buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit , since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table .
1	i purchased this skateboard for my 7-year old daughter . her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities , however , she did n't like the `` boy '' skateboards . she loves her new barbie skateboard
1	this review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike . first off , this is my second mongoose . i started out on a crappy low end cruiser model , so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement . the theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website . i thought i was getting a white bike , and i 'm a little ticked it 's actually grey , but , whateva . assembly is n't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you 're doing . the documentation is adequate , but do n't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you have n't done it before . the documentation will frustrate you . but the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle , and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes do n't arrive screwed up like mine did . the front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant , it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated , which entailed messing with the front cable . simple enough , i suppose , but this assumes you know what you 're doing . i could n't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake , and , wanting to be safe instead of stupid , i took the bike to an lbs and had them install it . it was then that i found out one of the disc pads was missing . no problem . i just went back home and found it in the box . apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit . i did n't even know it was there because i have n't worked with disc pads before . it was a good thing i did n't toss the box right away otherwise i would have been sol . just be advised , however , that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing , depending on where you are , you may or may not be able to find replacement pads . you may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake . now onto the specs . the front disc brake is promax brand , dsk-400 , which in the world of mtn biking , is the generic low end . i had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you wo n't find a `` [ ... ] '' website . it was n't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better , but at least you 'll have a better idea what to look for . the documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike . go here instead : [ ... ] i would n't call the promax disc brake crap , but , close enough . note : if you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking , as in on a trail considered `` intermediate '' level , then upgrade the disc brakes . and if you 're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine , then the theory can probably handle it , just do n't expect miracles . as to the gears , there are 21 shimano flavored and they work flawlessly . they 're a pleasure to have because there is n't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end mongoose mtn bikes . the only problem i had was the upper gears do n't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say , to 2 , then upshift to 3 , for example , and so forth for the others . if you want 6 , then go to 5 , then upshift and vice versa . this may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed . as to the ride , the theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike . wow . just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing . you have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it . overall , this bike is good bang for the buck , but i would n't pay over $ 300.00 tops for it . if you 're going to go that high , you can get something else with higher end parts . oh , one last thing . if you value your reproductive organs , and do n't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike , then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle . the one that comes with the theory is horrible . get a thicker padded , gel lined , split saddle instead .
0	i recieved umbrella from unclesams umbrella shop of n.y. , then returned it as it was too big . i have never recieved a refund of over $ 25.00 . i would like to know what happened and when i will get my money back . umbrella was picked up by ups on 03/07/05 . i can be reached at : vlb47 @ earthlink.net i look forward to a resolution to this problem . thank you , vick
0	we opened 2 razor bumper buggy 's for hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member . both of them were missing the charger for the battery ( and other hardware ) , so our kids could n't even play with them . they were very disappointed . what is worse , razor 's customer service is terrible ! they would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt . of course , since they were gifts , we did n't have the reciept . razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement , which wo n't be for a couple of weeks . then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers . all this hassle , all the hours on the phone , when they could have just sent us the missing chargers , like any decent company would for such a high price item ! our poor kids , just looking at their motionless bumper cars . of course , we ca n't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in februrary when we actually get to use it . happy hanukkah to you too , razor
1	we just got it , i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine , and i let it sit for a day and a half . it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time . shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long . we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight . this works perfectly .
1	this product was constructed better than the one i use at the gym . it is very heavy duty and has lots of padding . it is comfortable for both myself and my husband to use .
1	thanx for the great mat ! i hope to become a better golfer because of it
0	we bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store . from the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly . i train using a heart rate monitor so i can follow my heart rate during excercise , if we tried to use the schwinn 's 418 's hr programs it read anywhere from 40 to 60 bpm too low ! ! ! , what that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 bpm when we were going aerobic at over 150 ! ! ! . not only is that dangerous , especially for someone who never trained before , but it made 30 % of the machines functions unusable . add a display that 's hard to read , controls that are anything but logical , and this unit is a loser , no matter what consumer reports says . on top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered , and when they arrived , the machine still malfunctioned . the only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person who worked with us to exchange the schwinn for a better trainer from another company . bottom line , stay away from the schwinn 418 , there 's a reason schwinn only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics , they knew this machine is worthless , do n't you find out the hard way
0	may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office , but not much good as an outdoors job food jar .
0	these seats , while they are as nice as they look , do not fit into a `` seat '' at the stadium , rendering them useless ! they take up 1.25 seats per , and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them , especially if you have 2 . they need to make them a few inches smaller
0	i just got the sword and i liked it but i thought that it was a little small . then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it ! ! ! ! ! now you might think that i was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wa n't on there very good . after that i was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off . so do n't buy the sword if you going to do anything but look at it
0	the product is well made , and a great idea for travel without a mat . however , i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating . however , although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface , your skin slips out of them when you sweat , making them worthless . guess i will stick with having a towel around !
1	i bought one of these for friends that have children , and one for a friend who is married without children . they all seemed to love it !
0	my daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them . she learned how to move about on them although a year later she 's still quite wobbly . the shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use . my problem is that there really is no way for her to stop . no knob brake like normal skates have , so most of the time she 's pretty out of control or walking like frankenstein . also , the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own , so we have to dot it for her . it was n't like that when i first bought it , though . we bought her normal skates for christmas to replace these .
1	this is a great helmet . my daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it
1	deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off in 2 6 '' x9 '' areas were discovered during move-out ; this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors . simply rubbed the felt-like stick over the area , and the gouges seemed to `` fill in '' ! applied 2 more layers , and were amazed ! could n't tell where they were .
1	the display is pretty much perfect , but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward . a litte bump inside holders allow balls to move
0	i used to have ddr for xbox and when my xbox broke on me , i decided not to spend the money on a new one . however , i missed my ddr workouts everyday so i bought this as a replacement . i should have spent the money on a new xbox . this product is not worthy of having the name ddr on the box . imagine a dance pad game for atari . then imagine it is the worst possible atari game you have ever seen , and that would be a close description of this game . there are 50 computer generated `` beeping '' monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you . the rythem and the timing is off on all the songs , and the dance pad is very poor quality . it was n't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home . i wish i had sent it back without opening it . now i 'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take .
1	one has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one 's needs or requirements . imo , the pros and cons are ... pros : these tabs weigh only a few ounces , but can treat up to 20 liters . they are very effective at killing off viruses , bacteria , giardia , and cryptosporidium ( epa accepted ) . this product is great if you ca n't build a fire or boil water . cons : one tab for one liter so unless you stock up , you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal . or 4 liters per day for roughly $ 10 . compare this to 96oz ( ~56000 drops ) of clorox for $ 4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal . of water . katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water , but i disagree . there is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine imo . minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both . alternative : boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost ! :
0	i am the captain of a walking team and i purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members . i wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it . on the very first day , the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions , and by the end of the day , one of the buttons had fallen off . i do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers . i should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money
1	i bought the x-lander because i am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when i needed it . the watch is well designed and of good quality . a few things did disappoint me , but i think they are outweighed by the features , however . - it appears that it does not have a second time zone . why they would not include this is beyond me . as a pilot i want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format . a traveler would want time here and at home . it is not there , but is on other models they offer . - the dial is not the easiest to read and i had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit . the display needs to be more vivid . the company does offer a white face with black numerals , which might be better . it is a nice watch , but not the greatest execution of the concept , especially for $ 300
0	if your toes get hot it has a zipper for that . ( useless ) better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom . its small ( even the long one ) for a big guy . i wouldnt use it for anything but the summer ( and you will most definatly need a good pad
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions . one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still . as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me , i urge you to buy something else
1	the dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice . they are very accurate as far as i can tell in comparing them to my lacross clock/weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports . the hygrometer may be off by 2 % but am not convinced this is true as yet and i can adjust it . i set the barometer to +1.1 '' for my 1050 ' above sea level . i wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick . it is not that bad , but i would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that . the one thing i do not like is that i should have checked the dimensions of it . i am not sure if they were listed when i bought it . so check the size of what you think you life before you purchase . this one seems a little small . not the gages but the mounting board . it could be a little wider and a little taller . i also , somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board . i would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such . the wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch . i do n't mark down for this . i mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider . not buy much , but maybe an inch wider and 2 ' taller . overal i like it alot . i just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size .
0	one of the worst ! the braces that secure the material and the tent together broke ! after taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods . when i went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped . it sits on our from curb for garbage as i write this review
0	i woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the plantars faciitis was giving me for the following reasons : -the front part of the sock device is extremely narrow . i do n't have wide feet , but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that i had to adjust for constantly . could never get used to it . -the strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed . took forever to find the right tightness that did n't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly . -honestly , even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with . a simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective , along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day . do n't waste your money
0	this is a nice bag with a fatal flaw . the major zippers break very easily . after my first bag broke within a few months , amazon kindly provided a free replacement . deja vu ensued . for a few extra dollars , delta could use more robust zippers -- they really should .
0	is it squeeky ? yes . but i did n't mind . what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use . i did n't use it vigorously , and i 'm only 160 lbs . i 'd say avoid
1	my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state -- they wanted to share email address -- -no one had a pen/pencil so my husband 's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with . everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside . my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it -- -could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift -- -he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning . thanks
0	received the order in a timely fashion however , the box was badly i mean badly damaged . it was a birthday gift for a family member . i always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . we had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . to make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . happy birthday ! ! ! ! ! ! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you did n't know that
0	the following were the problems : 1 . bent fender - poor packaging 2 . sratches in paint in several areas 3 . three nuts were missing 4 . the front wheel hub had lateral play - can not be fixed planning to return cycle if amazon accepts it
0	i have been looking for nice ti set for camping , and finally found it in amazon at very cheap price ! the ti set is really light and good for backpackers . unfortunately , i found one my of set ( i bought 2 sets ) got manufacturing defects , the fork is bent at a smaller angle , which looks quite weird when i stack them together . hope brunton should do better qa on their products . apart from this , the ti set is quite nice ! but buy with your own risk ( you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only ! )
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered . the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon . amazon was great and sent me new one . this one worked for a few days . i then had the battery replaced . two weeks after it stopped working . by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen . i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain . i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent . in short , the watch is awful .
1	wow ! i was really pleased with my purchase . i 've never owned a heavy bag before so i did n't know what to expect . i just started martial arts so i wanted a bag to practice on , but i did n't have a lot of money to spend . this purchase was not only well within my price range , but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves ! the gloves are n't very padded , a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag . the heavy bag comes filled and is very solid , the chain is heavy duty , and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching . i was a little uncertain about just what the nevatear material was , now i know . my description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling . in my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags , yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag . two other purchases i would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag ( i purchased some padded grappling gloves ) and for the speed bag you will need two things : ( 1 ) a swivel attachement ( i bought the everlast plastic ball swivel for about $ 15 at a local academy sports store ) and ( 2 ) you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment ( i made mine from 2 x 6 's and 3/4 '' mdf ) . all in all , a great purchase ! i could n't be happier
1	i hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as `` tactical , '' because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry . but the first and last thing i have to say about the ken onion tactical blur is that it is one fearsome knife . a curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications , such as skinning mastodons and so on . this knife , on the other hand , has a chisel-like tanto point , which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods . it would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes , linoleum flooring , or metal garbage cans . technically , this is n't a switchblade . switchblades are bad . we know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels . this is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening . but if i ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the blur , i 'd say it was quite a knife . the blade is shaving-sharp from the factory , and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid . use your imagination . i have n't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet , but it 's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch . folded , the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem . i do n't even notice it in my hip pocket , which is where it rides whenever i happen to be wearing pants . if walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you , remember a couple of things . one is that you can buy it from the wall for $ 55 , and the wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people . another is that crimes , to my knowledge , are not generally committed with knives like these , but with such evil implements as kitchen knives , screwdrivers , and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene . lastly , you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious , but if you do , you will *really* need it . and you 'll have it
1	me and a friend bought 2 of these . they look really cool . however they are not sharp at all ( hence only 4 stars ) . for $ 15 they are really good value though . the hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin . other than that they are quite good .
1	i bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors . none of us had played before , so we did n't need top-of-the-line , and the price was right on this set . it 's everything it needs to be : weighty , colorful , and compact in its case . the widgets are pretty bendy , but if they bend out of shape , they bend right back . turned out to be a good investment . a word of warning if you have small dogs : put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles . my little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course . it was funny , until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball , which made solid contact with her little head . ( she 's fine now , but is no longer a fan of the game . ) all in all , i would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors
1	i bought this for my son who is 4 . he loves it and can operate it whith out any help . good quality and can take alot of abuse
1	the drishti yoga strap is just great ! i 've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga . ( several different studios , borrowed friends ' , etc . ) this one is excellent . it 's 2 feet longer than standards straps , but it 's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal ! it 's also thick and sturdy . i would certainly recommend this product
1	***** this is an upscale designer water bottle , top of the line , and so much fun . the designs of sigg 's water bottles are gorgeous , from the plain , solid color bottles , to the ones with intricate designs . they are simply beautiful ! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns , thinking it would take more work to maintain . these do necessitate regular cleaning ( i clean mine every day ) , but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun . sort of like my rings , glasses , and watch , i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory , reminding me to drink more water , making a statement about my values , and expressing myself with a special design . yes , all in a water bottle ! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality , made of light aluminum on the outside , slightly insulated , and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever , unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles . they are light , durable , and perfect for any activity . well water tastes spectacular in these bottles , just like from the tap . sigg bottles come with several different types of tops . i bought the screw top because i do n't like sports tops , and i do n't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink . it is totally leakproof , which is important to me . the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner . i get comments on it all the time , `` what 's that ? i love it ! '' the sports top version is ok ; i just am not a fan , as i do n't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top . however , for convenience , you might prefer it . for children , there is a cap-type top . all are leak-proof . if you are ever unsatisfied with the top , you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle . sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6l and 1l in this style . i have both . i use the .6l for sports activities because they are smaller . when i wo n't have to carry the container , i like the larger bottle . sigg also makes a smaller .3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people . you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too , such as .75l , .4l ( for kids ) , .6l , .5l . you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5l size , also . search amazon for the perfect size . pick a style and pattern you like , as this bottle is a personal accessory , and should reflect your style . the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon . they are expensive , but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years . i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health , so they are well worth it value-wise for me . highly recommended . ****
0	does not work like advertised . ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again . it may also damage a wood or aluminum bat . last time i buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon .
1	this is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves , my 2nd pair of this exact speedo aqua fitness glove . allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit . with other gloves , water builds up inside the glove and , if lycra-backed for example , the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while . these speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes . in addition , the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves i have had . the palms hold up well as do the backs . i recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec. 6 , 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped . they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock . best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service
1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great . as has been said , it takes some time learning all it does , but it 's worth it in my opinion . the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit , but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches , they all do this to an extent . everything else i 'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone . the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration .
0	we registered for two of these mobiles for our twins . we recieved both of them . upon putting them together , we realized that the mobile ca n't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib ! how annoying ! we returned them both
1	hey , i decided to review some things i did n't buy off amazon , but i have owned for sometime that are really great items : the kind i would buy again for sure if they were lost . i would say lost or broken , but jansport has lifetime warranties ! if anything happens to your backpack , all you have to do is mail it to jansport with a note of the problem , they will fix it for free and send it back to you . they will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon . overall , these are such great products , you just have to get a jansport if you 're thinking of a backpack . also , i am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful , which i hope it really is , i would love to have your yes vote ! with care , sa
1	this chin up bar works well . i 'm 160lbs and it holds me with ease . great addition to any other home gym equipment , or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot
0	this item is a piece of junk . all you get is smudges and black marks . it does not work . buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper . just please do n't buy this thing
1	this rack works perfect for me . it as easy to assemble and its easy to use . it folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use . my bikes have curved cross bars , so this mounting style was my only option , and it works great
0	if you order this sword , you may not get what you see . yes you will get the same 'style ' of sword , but as for the look , forget it , the steel is pure black . now if that 's what you want great , i personally wanted the 'silver ' steel look , but got the 'jet black ' steel . do n't worry , it was the same sword , just a different color .
1	i ordered the schwinn 203 just a week ago . it was eligible for free delivery and i took advantage of that offer . it stated that it would take extra time for delivery , however it arrived within a week . though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and i had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes . the directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped . once we were finished assembling it i got on it and started it up and began peddling . i was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all -- mechanical or otherwise . i then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly . my wife and i both use it and love it . i am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts i do n't expect to be 325 for long . super bike ! ! very pleased ... besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee i torn up last year and it 's doing fine
1	my box arrived somewhat banged up , but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar , it was ok . but , after 2 days i started hearing a noise , seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox , sounded like a loose object bouncing around . i was afraid i would have to ship it back . i called schwinn , and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if i could reproduce the sound . i assured her , it was not the pedals . she said , `` yes sir , now please take the pedals off '' . i did , and , it was the left pedal ! sounded just like the interior . anyway , they will send me new pedals , so problem solved . sounds like they have encountered this problem before . also , i was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen , so i bought 2 doorstops , removed the standard mounting screws , and used `` goop '' adhesive to make the screen lean forward . now i can read it ! someone at scwinn did not do the q.c . on that screen issue . anyway , great bike , now i 'm happy .
1	my 24 month old son loves this bike - it was fairly easy to put together , and works well . thanks
1	on the basis of the first review here , i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it . this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up . i use it every day
0	while this rack looks good , and appears well constructed , it 's mounting system leaves something to be desired . while attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around , i managed to bend the locking lever . now do n't get me wrong , this is mounted on my wife 's bike ( a cruiser ) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on . but having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying . i suppose i will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation . by the way , i have a delta rear rack on my atb that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp . much sturdier , and it was much less expensive , as well
0	when i was assembling this product i discovered that not only were the instructions vague , and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given , but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured . the predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height . my thought is ... how hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth ? luckily i own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes , but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers ? i wish i could give this product a higher rating , but hopefully there are better alternatives
1	the ball is good overall . one big issue , however , is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then . you 'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime . yeah , i used it on a indoor wooden court : -
1	i bought this helmet for my 3 year old . he likes it , it seems to fit well , seems to adjust fairly easily , received good reviews from consumer reports . the only thing i do n't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin . my son has n't complained about this being uncomfortable , but it looks like it might possibly be . i ca n't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin , it 's just the way they are attached to the helmet . generally though , i am very happy with it . oh , another thing , in the photo , the helmet looks almost red , white , and blue . it 's really dark gray and black . i think the photo does n't show this actual helmet but the design ( style and stars ) are the same
1	on the advice of my chiropractor , i decided to buy an inversion table , but did n't want to spend a lot of money because i feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room , along with my rowing machine and exercise bike . so i purchased this calm system because it was inexpensive and i figured i could sell it or send it back if i ended up not using it . well , so far i and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain , and best of all you do n't have to spend a lot of time on the machine . about 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine . also , the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit . overall , i am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system . there is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy
0	i did n't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as i plan to use it while recovering from surgery . this one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable . it does the job , but only just . i 've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably . sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just wo n't come on . at first it worked great . also , the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly . not in danger of falling off or anything , but just not a secure connection to the base . overall , the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work , but i did hope for better quality
1	great item but really too large for 3 year olds . maybe good for 5 or older .
0	i just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust . i gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me . they legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself . i only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so i ca n't complain . at least my 3 month old likes to look at it . i would not recommend buying this toy
0	the console that came with mine is broken ... so i have n't been able to use it . i have been told by the customer support people @ schwinn/bowflex - since the middle of february - that a replacement is on it 's way ( even the `` supervisor '' said this to me ) . hear that ticking ? yeah , that 's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out . am i happy ... no ! ! maybe i 'll write another review when i get my new console and i can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - i 'm one heck of a ticked off customer . save yourself the headache and just go to the gym
1	i purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer . they did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady . very easy to get the bikes in and out of . great product
1	we researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model . this is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table . the ankles are comfy and secure . the dvd shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right . as you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design . the best part is using it . it feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas . i ca n't wait to use it again . we love it .
1	mine is blackened , scratched , dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more , but i love it . this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water . the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow . i think it 's part bucket . this is the one
0	my buddy died wearing this mask . well he did n't die but he lost his eye . the mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye .
0	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle . one of them worked perfect , snug fit and everything worked . the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic . this is my second , and last purchase from zefal , i was happy it wasnt made in china ... but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis
0	positive : -size , good surface area -chipping net negatives : -poor instructions -very hard to set up by yourself . really takes 2 people , because nothing fits tight , so as you try to get one side in , the other side pops out . -nothing locks in . plastic caps to hold rear poles do n't fit tightly . the 'male ' sticks that go into the 'female ' section of the rear poles are not tight , so a wind from the rear pushes it over . i have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable . i taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners . i 've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug
1	my husband is an airline pilot , and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements . there frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports . this is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store . thanks for offering these by the case
0	we 've gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding . the gimmick is n't worth it and there are better balls like the original zi/o and the excel for outdoor and the tf1000 for indoor
0	i 'm a big fan of topeak 's gear . i own two of their racks , couple of pumps , bags , etc . i use the mtx trunk bag/panniers to commute , and i live in florida so i needed rain cover . i purchased this , and to my surprise -- -- topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie . yes , the cover is yellow . yes , there 's a reflective triangle . but that 's not the same as a blinkie . gee , topeak , do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain ? stupid lack of planning .
0	i love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses . very disappointed with this product
0	not very bright for an led . and , guess what ? this is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it , one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something ... well , the spike is more like a thumbtack . i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer , so i do n't blame amazon - but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this .
1	this is the best ab workout machines i have ever bought ... and it works ! i had no problem with the shipping or the actual product
1	pros : 1.great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain ( if you know where to put it ) . 2.lots of room able to put just about everything in it . gym clothes , several text books , laptop , camping gear , etc . cons : 1.its bulky , even when nothing is in it , its bulky . if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you . tip : to make less bulky , put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment . 2 . the shoulder strap strain resistant does n't quite work ... i 'm consider myself an average male , strain works in about 25lbs . if you want less strain i 'd go for the targus or wenger brands . conclusion : if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w/o the style involved this product is for you
0	more of a novelty than a useful flashlight . need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful . the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times ... would not recommend buying this flashlight , trying to return mine .
0	when the scope arrived , it came slightly cracked on the end you look through , which was n't a good start . then , when i looked through , there was no magnification , just small red crosshairs . if you are looking for a functioning scope , do not buy this scope . but if ur looking to decorate your gun , then this looks pretty cool on it
0	i recieved the arachnid electronic dart board and it looked very cheap . the numbers looked like a child put stickers around the board . the entire left half of the board would not register that those numbers were hit by the darts . i bought a different dart board from walmart that was cheaper and way nicer .
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item . i think it is a good concept , but it does n't work well at all . it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it . i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything . it is awkward to drink from too . i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market . not worth buying . just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation
0	i gave this product one star because it was the lowest option . what i really give it is this : warning ! the outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk . i installed it on my suburban ( which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch ) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it . it swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed . my wife had went on the target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal . by the time i had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the bay area from laketahoe ( in the middle of the night ) i noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle . i pulled over in the dark and checked it out . due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet ! needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking . roping the rack to try and stabilize it . i 'm taking the rack back to target
0	this compass fails to do the one simple task i purchased it for , which is simply telling me which direction i am going . i spent $ [ ... ] for a [ ... ] compass made out of crap materials . it works only for the direction you set it at . for example if you set it while facing north , it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions , the result is completely random ... . this compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually ( gasp ) might turn . absolute rippoff .
1	works well . much faster than the `` cheap '' metal swivel that has only the hook . if you do n't have a wealth of speed-bag experience , be prepared to `` re-learn '' when you upgrade to this swivel
0	three of these broke . granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed , but to no avail . my wife received something similar from spri ( doctor 's tubing ) and it has lasted for a few years now
1	i 'm very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service . the exactness of the finish and , the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal . my son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on christmas . thanks everyone , g. hanso
1	being a bodybuilder , i hoist heavy weights all the time ; a major stress especially when it comes to squats . i ordered the boots when i realized i had shrunk to 5'10.5 '' from being 6'0.5 '' . i was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging ( 5 times a week , 10-15 min intervals ) that i am nearly back to my original height ( 6 ' 0.25 '' ) . i highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [ emphasis on good ] chiropractic care . to those who have/will order this product , do n't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first ; that 's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [ which cushion the vertebrate ] start rehydrating . also , it will take some time to find the strap tightness that 's right for your legs . generally , tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination . p.s . hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself .
1	i agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market . take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks ( just like on camelbak hydration backpacks ) . the bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down . my only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere . however , the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles . thus , by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles , you can get the best of both worlds . also , it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option , so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle
0	i wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order . i also tried the company web site and could not fine info there .
0	i do n't really write reviews , but i felt like i needed to say something about this one . maybe its me , but i could n't get the pump to work . so i bought a new basketball . i bought a regular one , and bought a pump . i wish that infusion thing worked out , because it would have been great to deflate it , put it in my bag , and then pump it up again at the court . but my friend warned me they do n't work so good . i 'm just stubborn i guess . that 's my 2 cents . take it for what its worth
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two . after applying one vial , it seemed even worse than before . ( tread `` catches '' as i walk . ) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable . ( still not great . ) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality
1	the thule sidekick was the perfect size - not too big , not too small . it did not appear clunky-big on top of the car , nor was it too small to fit anything in . the assembly was a snap ( did it with only one person - no problem ) . it withstood freeway speeds in oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box . highly recommended
0	the way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers , and filled with sand , for weight , at the bottom - the part you do n't punch . i was wondering why it felt like i was punching a brick wall on the left side : that 's where they stuck the bags of sand . just what a fighter needs before a fight ( or anyone needs at any time of their life ) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock . this is a clear defect : i am considering returning it . not sure if they 're all like this , but i assume mine is not unique . ca n't find where it says it was manufactured , but in this day and age , and based on the `` craftsmanship '' , it 's reasonable to assume china . hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in missouri ! mine also suffered a little damage during shipping : the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed . it usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it 's own . hey , it 's hit or miss when you order online , particularly with oversized items , as far as shipping an `` handling '' are concerned . the shipping box was damaged and oil stained , the product poorly constructed . so , i 'd call this a `` miss ''
0	this gun is a piece of $ # ! my bro got it some time ago . he was so excited . it made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft . he loaded it , aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away , sprayed as accurately as possible , and guess what happened ... ? yup , out of the 20 in the clip , about 5 or 6 hit . not on the bull 's eye , i can tell you that . the 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort , and the accuracy sucked like mad , but my brother 's hopes were not dashed yet . ( -_- ) he filled up the 110-shot mag , winded it up , aimed , and the same thing resulted , only this time , the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds . out of maybe 50 shots fired , about 12 hit . i checked the gun all around , but it was not defective at all , except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply . my brother tried it on semi-auto , which is usually more accurate . not for this gun , though . in fact , the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature ! ! ! out of 10 shots , one or two hit ! i could n't tell because this gun 's 140 fps made barely a sound when it hit the target ! ( we were shooting in the dark . ) let 's not even talk about the `` red dot scope , '' or the `` silencer . '' i only gave it a two because ( 1 ) that is the next lowest you can give , and ( 2 ) this gun 's looks is okay . please buy a different gun off ebay or something ! ! ! you can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks ( if you bid correctly ) ! by the time my brother had finished playing , his dopamine levels were probably under normal . in simple terms , he was disappointed
1	this rack was great and easy to install . but i never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night i installed it some person backed into and ran off . what made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch . since i was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off i painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands . over all i though it was a great rack i just wished someone did not back into it but i know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck .
1	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again . does exactly what it is supposed to do , and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability . great for spotting oneself too . i would buy it again , tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe . so if you can burn the $ 35 or so , get it with no fear . otherwise , use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout
1	my wife and i love this product . now , it 's not for backpacking , but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove . it does require one of those disposable propane tanks ( which can be tough to dispose of ) , and it might make sense to get the carrying case ( not seeing it attached here ) . but besides that , a great , simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions
1	the bike arrived in fine condition , no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported . it was really easy to assemble . once i had assembled it i tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something . so , i undid all the screws ( a pain ) and opened the plastic-enclosed base . there was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way , but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging , and would interfere with the gears . so i taped it to the side , closed the plastic up , and that was that . since then the bike has worked really well . i wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but i can see how someone taller could have trouble with it . the seat is not terribly comfortable , which gets to be a problem on longer rides , but it 's fixable with a pillow or cushion . the console is great - has all the information displayed all the time . plenty of resistance . overall there are some problems with it , but for under two hundred dollars , i suppose i ca n't complain too much . definitely worth the money
0	... for more than a couple of minutes ( no matter what i did ) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink . overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke . i 've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
0	this ramp set is really fun to skate on , but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage . first it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms . screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem . the worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward , making it so you have to constantly pull it back down . i forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and i went flying . but do n't let this turn you away . it is a good fly box nonetheless , but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime , not a year .
1	when the product came i realized that it was n't what i was looking for in a fanny pack but i was impressed with its rugged construction . i needed a pack to walk around disney world and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy . i like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day . the water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you ca n't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle . plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another dasani . unfortunately , you ca n't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that would n't stop a regular 16 oz . job from slipping passed . so i 'm returning mine , but if your looking for non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , in a rugged waistpack then this is for you . ps for some reason the blue one is cheaper , at least when i bought it
1	my treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time . i never had a problem like that with this one , once it 's on , it keeps reading until i take it off . it 's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym , so i do n't have to hold the handles any more
1	most posters here have n't actually bought/used a toilet monster . it 's a really great joke/prank . we bought one and used it for my mother-in-law . she was stunned and a bit disoriented ... then ... wait for it ... she laughed really really hard . it 's not scary , just startling . the way we installed it , if someone opens the lid and seat , they wo n't see it , so it 's best to try on women . great for the price
1	i bought this for myself to play with ( i 'm 35 ) and after all the presents were opened and toys , video games , and everything were forgotten ( about 4 hours after christmas ) , this was the ongoing favorite of the season . everybody , younger ( down to 8 ) and older ( to 45 ) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching . it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such . this is a great present for 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there will be some good spills on the fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , are a must ( and a video camera !
1	after reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions i was a little worried . myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue . all parts were included , instructions were clear , she did the step check off 's the base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction
1	ok so i read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove . our stove is great ! we took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly . the ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their colemans . in fact several friends could n't believe the heat this little guy produced . we love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come
0	rec 'd this pitchback and assembled , the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time . park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults . very disappointed .
0	i ordered this pilates ring because i had used one in my health club- big mistake . it is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless . would n't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady . ( the vendor sent it fast though .
1	this is a great tennis bag with good space . fits 3 racquets easily and several separate areas . i love it
0	we opened 2 razor bumper buggy 's for hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member . both of them were missing the charger for the battery ( and other hardware ) , so our kids could n't even play with them . they were very disappointed . what is worse , razor 's customer service is terrible ! they would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt . of course , since they were gifts , we did n't have the reciept . razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement , which wo n't be for a couple of weeks . then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers . all this hassle , all the hours on the phone , when they could have just sent us the missing chargers , like any decent company would for such a high price item ! our poor kids , just looking at their motionless bumper cars . of course , we ca n't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in februrary when we actually get to use it . happy hanukkah to you too , razor
0	keeps the drinks chilled but not cold what do you expect for $ 20bucks would no buy again . would go for the more traditional fridges
0	i have a small head and this was way too tight for me . it pulled my hair and left me with a headache . plus it has a strong chemical smell that did n't go away after wearing in the pool . i tried it 3 times , thinking it might get better , but gave up and threw away . spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead
0	i bought mine at the same toys r ' us sale and had the exact same issue . both my husband and i own trek bikes and it would n't work his bike at all . it fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier . i woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it wo n't work comfortably while you 're riding . not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he did n't look comfortable in it anyway . the free helmet is way too small for his head . we 've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet . i think we 're going to a bike shop
1	i 'm on my 5th cap now i think . silicone is great and lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which can snag hair ) and latex ( which some people are allergic to ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , has a glossy finish so it looks great and does n't lose elasticity . i have a some advice if you want to try this product that i 've learned overt the years : 1 . always rinse and hang dry . i 've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect , it develops black spots . i do n't know if it 's mold , it does n't wash off ... and you 'll have to buy a new cap if you do n't like the spotted look . 2 . pull it on gently . i 've ripped one when i was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it 's not cloth so you have to be careful . this goes for latex and rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair is dry when you put it on , you will trap air under the cap . and since it 's not a permeable material , the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside . 4 . pick a fun color . that 's it . have a great swim
0	i got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k , and it defiantly not 95 % accurate . i run ~10-11 minute mile ; yet , both on the treadmill and outside , this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile . distance was also off by +20 % , when running . speed and distance ~98 % accurate for walking 15 min/mile .
0	i car camp around 6 weeks a year . every night on a different spot . i was looking for a light and sturdy table . easy to setup and easy to pack . this table is not the right table for me . yes it 's light . that 's the only good atribute i can find for this table . it 's cumbersome to setup . the plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile . the end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled . it 's low to the ground . i would not buy this table again , nor i would recommend anyone to buy it . i give it one star because i ca n't give it any lower . alvaro sacramento , ca
1	i bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab/great dane mix and it is pretty big on him . admittedly he 's still pretty skinny despite his weight but i had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him . probably better for broader dogs but i 'm sure mine will grow into it : o ) the quality is excellent and there 's plenty of packing space , overall i 'm pleased with it especially for the price . if your dog is skinny/narrow i 'd order the next smaller siz
0	we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , with alot of different features , but we have n't been able to use it . it did n't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with ironman 's customer service department ever since . they keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we 're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day . well after 2 weeks , we 've had it ! we 're taking it back and never buying another ironman product again . they 're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they wo n't get anyone out there to fix it ? nothing against the store , they 've been great . just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer
1	on the basis of the first review here , i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it . this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up . i use it every day
1	the last ball i had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it . i 'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time i need a little more air . the pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too . at my kids birthday party i used it to fill some inflatable decorations and i 've used it to fill an air mattress . so two things : the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy
0	three days after i put this on my keyring , the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together . then , a week later , the compass popped out of the case . it 's now in my tool drawer . perhaps , only mine was this fragile
0	do not waste your money . i wish i could give it zero star
0	i purchased these teva 's for kayaking . these are the most uncomfortable sandals i have ever worn . they are even painful while sitting in a boat . i do not recommend them
1	if you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand/pocket warmers ! they are even great for just being outside for a walk ! i have poor circulation and must keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick
1	perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8-8 oz . servings of water each day . fill it up in the morning and make sure it 's empty by the time you go to bed at night ! very sturdy and best of all - no plastic taste to your water !
1	i own several led flashlights including 3 different ones from c crane company . this little unit from garrity outshines them all . it is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand . if you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you , throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights
0	the sportline 353 talking pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an fm radio , but it has 2 issues . the good : the talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on . it is nice to hear when you are rolling along , `` 9000 steps . '' the fm radio is very elementary , but functional . there is no dial to tune . you push a button and it rolls to the next station . there is a volume control on the earphones . the pedometer uses aaa batteries that can be purchased anywhere . the bad : the pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor . it did n't break , but it was very annoying . several times it popped off w/o me knowing and i left it in a restaurant or in a friend 's car . the ugly : if i accidentally bumped the reset button - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day 's count and went back to zero . the pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost . this would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day . very frustrating . the clip broke after about 3 months -- so i retired it . i bought a omron hj112 premium pedometer and have been very pleased with it . it has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband , the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor . it has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight . it has a clock . it uses a button battery . it does not have a radio and it does n't talk , but it works and works well . the sportline would be good if it had a teather , a clip that did n't break so easily , and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally .
0	the attachment is n't textured enough to stay where i put it . as i ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand
1	i am very pleased with this rack . the only thing i do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack . i would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something . i guess i 'm just lazy . i reccoment this product
1	we just got this bag today for our son . we got the short version of this bag , but i do n't see that version on amazon anymore . the outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly , and the zipper is very smooth . the inside is a little scratchy , but i am sure it will be better after a washing . the drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air . the only thing i was disappointed about was the color . the picture on amazon , and on the box it came in , is turquiose . the bag is definitely not turquiose ! it is a darker blue - closer to navy - color . and the yellow is more of a mustard color , not a bright yellow , and the inside is dark gray . but my son likes it anyhow , and of course it does n't affect the quality of the bag . i like the fact that the hood turns inside out , too
1	the schwinn airdyne is built to last out of steel . for upper and lower body workout , it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor ; hint -- fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail . the onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets , calories , distance , speed , rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap . you can select miles or kilometers for distance and `` club or home '' for setup ; hint -- built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club . it even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count . assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver . this represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning , weight loss or just plain old exercise
0	when i first got the bike , i thought it was great . by 2nd ride the chain broke while i was trying to do a simple down shift . unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost . looking at the metal used it is no wonder it did n't last . very poor quality . too bad , because it is a great looking bike . i guess i 'll give wal mart a try next ... ... ...
1	i got this for my daughter awhile ago , but due to no snow , i had to wait to actually see if it worked . well , it did ! nicely made and durable . daughter loved it .
0	this was a bitter disappointment . one of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control . however , if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting , we get horrific feedback ( screeching ) . nothing seems to help and when i sent a note to the manufacturer for advice , i never received an answer . unfortunately i 'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem , so it looks like it 'll hit the trash . save your money and do n't purchase this item
0	i will never purchase an item from babyride again . this canopy is misleading . it said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net . the sun came right through and blinded my baby . not only that . it is not worth the price ! ! you could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for $ 5 . also , when i went to return the item they charged me a restocking fee which i had never heard of ! ! ! bad item . i ordered the rayshade by kiddopotamus and loved it ... get this one instead !
0	this is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky . if you have a place to set it up and leave it , fine , but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the tv ' , as described . performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment , but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use . i 'm disappointed
1	easy set up and directions and great functionality . no problems what-so-ever picking up the wireless signal .
1	first off you can find this price lots of places . it is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn . i choose to buy mine through amazon becasue i got 3 % back with my visa , free delivery , and did n't pay sales tax . that made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213 . i wanted the extra programs . delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery . no problems with the packaging in our case . assembly took about an hour and a half . it was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice . overall this assembly was much easier than most things i have put together . the bike is stable , quiet and smooth . easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman . overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use . i did n't rate this a 5 cause we 've only had ours a week
1	some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is ... it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate i shot my uncle with it and it made him bleed none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is ... the safety ca n't be pushed to hard or it comes out the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work please take my advice because i have had this gun for more than a year now and i know it front and back
0	very heavy easily torn -- reinforcement non fucnctional -- doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds -- i would not reccomend it at all -- wasted my mone
1	i bought this for my medium sized 9mm . luger with the laser sight attached to it . my cousine , who has been in the military for several years , recommended it to me . i 'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall , and it fits me well . he is over six feet tall , and it fits him just as well . it takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but , well worth the money . it is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much
0	description of bike was misleading . weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description . small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds . although i weigh slightly less than this , i am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart . i would not have purchased the bike had i seen this limit in the description . also , the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated . i thought i was purchasing a simple exercise bike , not such a complicated piece of machinery . this bike would be perfect for a younger , more athletic , slimmer person
1	there were a few minor imperfections , but i 'm overall happy with this sword . the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable
0	this gun is absolutley terrible . the third time i shot it , the thing broke ! the pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them . i would tell you more of how bad this was but i really do n't want to waste any more of my time
1	this works pretty well to get back and forth between classes , although you can tell that it 's a toy at heart . if you 're looking for something fun and easy , i recommend this scooter
1	i bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area , it worked great . the backpack does n't strain my back at all , the load felt very even . and the attached rainfly came in handy once as well . it comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras ( tent rods , sleeping pad , rope , etc ... ) i am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric
0	i trained for a marathon and several 10k races using a heart rate monitor . they are very good instruments for training and i recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape . after you 've purchased one or two of them , you become a better shopper . i purchased an f-4 for a friend , and i was very , very disappointed in the battery life when i found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out . some of the newer heart monitors - nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years
1	we had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two . that seems simple enough , unless you 've actually been inside of some of the `` two-person '' tents . some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements , but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents . we have just used this tent for the first time , and we are so far pleased . plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags , and a bit of gear . a large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs . i believe this will be a great warm-weather tent , with all of the mesh . the night we used it , it dropped below freezing . we woke to a ceiling ( rainfly ) covered in ice ( on the inside ) . did n't really expect that , with all of the ventilation , but as it was ice , it did n't drip on us . i 'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather . one thing that i do n't like , although thus far it has not been an issue , is a seam running through the middle of the floor . it has been taped and sealed at the factory , but i just do n't like the looks of it . i will seal it again before spring use , and edit this report , as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south texas . the tent is in fact lightweight and roomy , and so far , i am pleased . i will amend this report after having enountered weather with it
1	i am not an exercise person . but , i need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they should n't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints . this machine is perfect for all of us . i put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy . the electronics on it are working just fine . it 's the kind of exercise machine that i can get on , watch tv , and forget i 'm actually exercising
1	the scooter is fine . the post office lost the package , though . i called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks , and would not send a replacement unless i was willing to pay for it in advance . i opted to purchase another one through a different company that used ups instead of usps ( more reliable shipping ) . several days later the first scooter arrived , three weeks late . the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it . so , now i have two and only needed one . i realize usps is at fault for the shipping , but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker . the scooter was a present for a birthday . i ordered in plenty of time to receive prior , but ended up with a very late present
1	this paddle is a bargain here at amazon . sports stores would easily sell this for over $ 20 . having said that , i found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game . `` but '' , i still eliminated many a younger player at our men 's retreat . there 's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear ! thanks , stiga
0	i thought this would be the ultimate gym bag . the main compartment is too narrow . your shoes will not fit side by side , you have to stack them . the pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough . the zippers are cheap and stick . it is very pretty but not very functional . my $ 16.00 bag works much better .
0	i bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm . the description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves ( using d cell batteries ) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours . in actuality , the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends . to make matters worse , the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand , no heat is provided to the fingers ! i did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves . the first battery that i tried ( it takes one d cell per glove ) was duracel with an experation date of 2013 ( in other words , brand new battery with lots of shelf life left ) . that battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying . the second set of batteries that i tried ( with the same experation date ) were made by eveready . that battery lasted 35 minutes . you should also note that the duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the eveready battery fits even worse ! these gloves are on their way to goodwill . maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something . if you are considering these gloves , think again ! the chemical packs work much better although they ( the chemical packs ) do have a shelf life . it just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours . still , that is better than using up two d cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes .
1	safety key was fine ... except i purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size i was looking for . i took a chance at the size so my own fault
0	the pedometer worked great for the first two weeks . than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans , it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it . it still worked , but i had to be careful when i opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached . last w/e it stopped working completely . everthing is set to 0 and wo n't move . my husbands odometer seems to be working fine . however , i 'm dissapointed for the short life-span ... . m. l. mcdermot
1	this is a great light , perfect for a `` be seen '' and backup light in addition to a stronger source . the plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out , apparently cracking from vibration fatigue . the customer support from princeton was terrific , though , and they sent a replacement mount ( i contacted them on friday and had the part monday ) . i may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part
1	the bike was delivered 70 % ( rough guesstimate ) put together . it was relatively easy to complete myself ( only had to use manual a few of times ) and i 'm certainly no expert . the only problem i encountered , was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire . with that being said ... . i spent a few dollars at our local bike/cycle shop to have it looked over ( basic tune-up service ) to make sure it was safe to ride . the bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike . overall , i think this is good value for the money ... but only if you 're looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter ( more casual ) trips
1	i just returned from a 20-day trip , and this new backpack went along . it is comfortable , commodious and just the ticket . i have a 25-year-old jansport backback ( still ticking , but a bit tattered ) that i have used and used , and i expect this one will provide the same service . it 's great
1	i 've never been a fan of propane stoves . they always seemed flimsy , made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now . after two weeks of rv-ing , the fold 'n go has become a welcome addition to our set up . it is very sturdy and seems extremely well made . the wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large , heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time . few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots . and it seems very stable when set on a table . and because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case , even though it handles such large tasks , it 's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space . it also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that 's it . you 're ready to cook . and after you 're done , clean up is a snap . unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty , spattered grease , this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off , wipe off underneath , flip the pot supports over to store inside and then fold 'n go ! it 's great to get cooking moved outside the rv - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam . and because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other , we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future .
1	great little knife . i 've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my native is too big . super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use . only beef is that it 's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size . i 'm going to have to get the leek
1	i had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product . the box was literally falling apart when it arrived . luckily no parts were damaged . on the plus side , the package arrived very quickly . the bench has lots features for the price . it was not difficult to assemble . it folds up very nicely as advertised . it is sturdy and easy to adjust . this is a very good value
1	two years ago , i tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball , which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court , 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour , a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall . i had two surgeries to repair the injury , and it was mostly successful . the biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand . i have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty , but i lacked the strength to do weight training . this device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me . i have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights . i am already seeing the difference in just two weeks . if you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries , i strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan . of course , check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise
0	i agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction , but took a bad turn somewhere . i get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register , and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what i 've actually consumed . and if you 're really thirsty , forget it - you 'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst . at $ 30 , it 's a hefty price to pay when it 's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day . sorry to say i 'll be returning my hydracoach
1	the first thing that i thought was `` this is a lot of equipment for the money '' . it comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble . took me about an hour . it 's relatively sturdy , although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises ( eg , the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips ) . overall , i do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine . keep in mind , that in order to use the chin up bar , there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling , as your chin will touch the top of the machine . most residential ceilings are about 8 feet
0	when i received the flashlight it was broken i have tried to contact mark golden in delray , florida , the place the flashlight was sent from , and have heard nothing back this week
0	this stand deserves a 0 , but that wasnt an option . the engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked . it is of poor design and quality . i wouldnt take if they were givin it away . i 've had it set up in my basement for a few days and i couldnt wait to take it down and return . which i did . pronto . do yourself a favor . stay away
0	i 'll be returning right away . suction cup does not hold at all . completely useless..
0	was billed by the company and they never sent it ... had to challenge the company to get a credit ... still waiting for my bill to see if credit was done..
0	this is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really , really hate . this thing does not shuffle plus it will eat up your cards badly . do not buy this piece of garbage ... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so . if you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase , here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new card shuffler . 1 . pet dog 's chew toy 2 . door stop 3 . play street hockey 4 . stress release stomping toy 5 . mother-in-law birthday gift 6 . modern art for coffee table 7 . nerf ball target practice 8 . condom dispenser kind of think about it , this is a great toy . have fun ! ps . if you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at : excalibur professional 6 deck card shuffler ; you might like it .
1	i 've owned three pairs of these so far , and they 're easily the best gloves i 've ever used . i had previously only used unpadded gloves , and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first . the padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them ( lat pulldown bars , for example ) , but that 's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips . i found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded harbinger gloves i 've worn . the gloves can be safely washed and air dryed , as advertised . my only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove . every pair i have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area .
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions . one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still . as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me , i urge you to buy something else
0	i consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds . i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big . i think that for a `` small '' backpack , that they are just too large . thank you
0	i wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because i am a tall person . i thought i had picked the perfect mat when i ordered this one . i did n't have a problem with the length ( although it smelled that new plastic stench ) but i did have a problem with the weight . this mat is heavy ! i knew it would be heavy when i purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape i did n't think i would mind it but i did n't realize that it would be cumbersome . the last straw that made me want to return it was when i was in a yoga class ; sweating and i began to slip on the mat . if i am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat i do n't want any problems . to amazon 's credit i was able to return it and they paid for postage . if i would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how heavy it is but i would have paid it anyway ( that should tell you how much i did n't like it ) . i am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free . i want something that will be biodegradable . the problem now is there are so many mats available ( too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few ) .
1	i have bought over 20 of these knives . i trim my nails , open packages , write notes , tighten screws , and strip wire ( great for stripping wire ) . you can buy replacement toothpicks and pens . i put toothpicks in place of the twizzers . i have never used the twizzers in 30 years . i can use the toothpick a couple times a day . i would love to see a thinner version with an led , toothpick and pen . airport security keeps taking my knives . remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it . the pen just pulls out . this is the best most used tool i have ever owned
1	we bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter . we backed our vehicles out of the garage , and zoom ... .they were off having fun . the box says `` ages 3+ '' and up to 55 pounds . the bumper buggie looks small , but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall . he can stretch his legs out in the car , but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old can also work the controls . it is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 . my only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it is so much fun ! best part is that there is little assembly required . the only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car
0	i try to use this but do n't work good ! ! . the best option is play in a court
0	this gun is not good . it is a piece of crud . beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks . get it if your a idiot . i wish i could give it 0 star
0	the front wheels came off the first day ... christmas day ! very frustrating !
0	the first schwinn fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit . the second one arrived but does not work . after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts ( which i did ) , it still does not work . this is absolutely useless . they will have to do something
1	the fat mouth clamp-ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from texas to colorado and back again . they came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again , will be quickly put back on . i would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack .
1	i was a little skeptical about the gazelle at first because it did n't look like you could get a work out from using it - but i was wrong ! but let 's start at the beginning : it 's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and i could do it all myself . i was really excited to use it so i hopped right on ( i 'm already used to ellipticals ) and enjoyed a great workout . i was sweating and after watching the training dvd , i worked my upper body and lower body . i look forward to using it tomorrow . now i do n't have to drag myself to the gym . i can work out at home ! downsides : it does squeak , but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix that . it folds up but it 's not extremely portable . i have it in my living room currently . all in all i recommend this product . i can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training , you 'll see results
0	i have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one . this one puts out a a poor amount of light . it also does not retain its charge well . you will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged . i would say it is one of the worst ones i purchased
0	this product is not very good . the speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun . getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating . avoid this ball
0	it is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - this pump is 100 % junk . so bad , that i am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump . the instructions were a disaster ... . and why would i need to look at instructions for a pump ? - well , that is because it does not work , and i mean does not work at all ! the lever on the side is a total gimmick ( does nothing as the previous review states ) . save your money here - do not buy this pump .
0	it works like a hook for clothes of my wife ;
1	i 've always loved victorinox swiss army knives , but i must admit that i when i purchased this one , i was not sure if i made the right choice , but my expectations were soon exceeded . it was right before a trip to the boundary waters canoe area wilderness in minnesota , i had lost my other swiss army knife ( a tinker ) , and i was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade . i did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness . i settled on this one because it was on sale , and i have not been disappointed . the handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle . for its size , it had just the right heft , but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt ( where i kept it in my buttoned breast pocket ) . the 4 '' locking blade worked wonderfully . i could close it with either one or two hands . when closing it , the blade pauses at the halfway point , reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed ( that said , it does not eliminate all risk , so close the knife with one hand at your own risk ) . during my recent canoe trip , i lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24 '' northern pike with this blade was quite painless ( though it did take some skill ) . beyond the blade , i 've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy , but the can opener blade is a primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced by wegner . the knife shipped in a simple cardboard box . a sheath or pouch would have been nice , but i was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip . since i kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip , the sheath was n't necessary , but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife . i recommend getting one . you will not be disappointed
1	estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar . mucho mejores que los aqua sphere . el asunto es que duran poco . despues de unas 50 idas a nadar , ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros . tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tamaño . yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tamaño medium . por el resto el producto es muy bueno , y comodo .
0	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck , it would have been better with metal zipper
1	i am a 71 yrs young female . i purchased these `` men 's '' skates for myself . i bought a size larger and they are very comfortable . as an older `` re '' learner these skates worked out just great . the wheel 's do n't have speed , which is what i was looking for . they are indoor // outdoor skates . they work better for inside skating . a great price and a great quality skate . especially for a beginner ( the wheels ) . no matter what age you are , these skates are the best . i love these skates
0	i have had this stroller for one day and i 'm going to send it back or sell it . i am so disappointed . i was so excited for this to arrive . we set it up ... instructions were a little shady here and there , and i try and adjust the seat . i have the strap pulled all the way back and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down . he hates it . he is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller . he was miserable because he could n't sit up and look around , plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he could n't even see the cheerios on the tray from his angle ! his playtex sippy could n't fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray , and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray . the construction is great , the fabrics are nice ... .overall i could have given it five stars , but the seat positioning is so extreme that it makes my son start to cry ... .that makes it a really crummy purchase . if you are wondering about which one to buy , do not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks
0	do not buy this bike . i got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke . the crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal , well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat .
0	i just got mine 3 days ago . i can see that it might help toning the areas . and the video is not annoying . what is a problem is the wonderful bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout . i did n't purchase this item for weight loss , i thought it would help for toning . but the bruises , while they may go away with continued use , are not worthe the $ $ . i am sending mine back today . sorry
0	before buying ddr , i read everyone 's reviews , and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it . this product really fools you , this is why : ~if you 've seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like , well the dance pad and the box looks normal ... untill you turn it on ! ~it says 50 songs , right ? well , it 's not really 50 different songs . about 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track . ~the graphics are horrible ... a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are . i would n't reccommend buying this ... at all
0	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied , socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place . i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other . i would not recommend these for anyone
1	... ..that 's the day that the first wiffle balls ( invented a year earlier ) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country . mr. david mullany created the first wiffle ball in fairfield , connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball . mr. mullany ( to whom we bow down and show obeisance ) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the wiffle ball , an american institution , was born . oh , wiffle ball , wiffle ball , it nearly compels me to wax poetic . i 'm now 46 years old , but the love that i have for the game of wiffle ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch ! my brother and i were born to a beautiful , baseball-loving woman . shirley grew up following the cincinnati reds , and as a child , she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten big league pitcher . as an adult , she worked for the los angeles dodgers and the los angeles angels ( that was before they became the california angels , and then the anaheim angels , and then the los angeles angels of anaheim , and then the chicago white sox victims ) . she instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for america 's pastime . ( in fact , my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys little league team . ) but when we were n't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys , and when we could n't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of `` over-the-line '' at the park , my brother , doug , and i were battling it out in a game of wiffle ball in the yard . we had some outrageously competitive games in our `` glory days . '' we perfected the art of pitching a wiffle ball , and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us . i remember 1990 and a young , athletic college student who , claiming to have played wiffle ball throughout his childhood , challenged this old geezer on the ucla field behind the john wooden center . well , my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day , and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times , he just shook his head , and i concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child , it was n't what my brother and i called , `` wiffle ball . '' if you have never owned a wiffle ball , you 've never really been alive , my dear friend ! although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time ( especially if you hang too many curveballs for my brother who swings with great authority ) , they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise ! they can be used anywhere outdoors because the wiffle ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce , and if doug never knocked one through a window , neither will you ! and although the wiffle ball is light , it does not follow that it should be taken lightly . after san francisco giant ( man , do i hate the giants ! ) , kevin mitchell won the 1989 national league mvp award , he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of wiffle ball the previous off-season . one of the greatest hitters of all-time , san diego padre , tony gwynn used to hit wiffle balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball . play with a wiffle ball and you 're in big league company ! the wiffle balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety . ( and surprise ! they 're still made in the u.s.a . the day production moves to communist china i 'll jump . ) twelve wiffle balls are currently going for $ 14.95 , that 's only $ 1.25 per ball . do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a wiffle ball ? well , take my word for it , you 'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth ! now all you need to do is get the regulation , old school , plastic yellow ( `` banana '' ) bat . of course , if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat . funny story : my dear ol ' ma bought an aluminum wiffle ball bat as a gift for my brother on his birthday . but she was n't sure what size to get , so she called the company . `` how old is your son ? '' the representative asked . when she said , `` 41 '' , he laughed loud and said , `` i think you 'll want to go with the heaviest model . '' one of the great disappointments in my life ( seriously ! ) is that they did n't think to organize wiffle ball competitions until doug and i were in our 40 's . we scouted out the competition at the `` wiffle ball world series '' here in phoenix a few years ago . ( players fly in from all over the country ! ) we figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis , we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more , if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year . alas , it never happened , what with work , and life , and all the other crap that gets in the way of wiffle ball play . but that does n't mean you ca n't fly into phoenix next year and win the title ! get to it , man ! get yourself a dozen wiffle balls , a `` banana '' bat and start practicing . hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half . want to throw a drop ? make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point . then get inventive ; there are innumerable variations on that theme ! you can thank me for the hint when you see me . you 'll recognize me because i 'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it !
1	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas . i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore , they love to wear them everywhere they go . great way to get the kids physically active !
0	first of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me . 2 weeks later ... .the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun . but it looks cool and its worth the price
1	i too recieved this bag in a box semi-beaten up , but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage . and no there was no interior protective bag , and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon . now to the bag itself ... the toughest , most well filled , and economical bags i have ever seen . i use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it 's density i can punch for hours ( if i had the stamina : ) ) , without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that i used to get from denser packed bags . plus it 's an everlast ! ! ! this is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag . good luck and train hard ! !
1	i use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane . i do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow . it rolls up to a nice compact size
1	this count up/down timer is exactly what i was looking for . no bells , no whistles -- just timings up and down . it 's small and light , and can be clipped or held . it even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces . i only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it does n't start counting ( and beeping ) if it 's accidentally brushed
1	i ordered 2 of these kickboards in blue after reading another review . they are not exactly the same size , but we really like them . they are very versatile and easy to use . i do think they need to put dimensions on the website
0	i am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me , it says that its adujustable , but it can only be made shorter and not longer . for a kid this is a good jump rope , but its definitely not for a tall person
1	the bowflex series 7 treadmill is as good as advertised . it was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough . it is also very easy to program and operate . no time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual . i also love the quietness of the motor . because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place . go ahead and get it ... ma
0	because you ca n't give negative stars , i 'll give this product one star . i bought this product instead of the ablounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight . i 'm glad this product was cheap , because it was the worst exercise machine i ever bought . everytime i swing on it , i feel it creak and wobble . i feel like its going to break under me each time i use it . it makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser . i 've been useing it for a few months , and all its done is make me feel akward . do n't buy this product if your plus size . if your not plus size , go get the 210 lbs weight limited ab lounger jack knife system thing . if your are of plus size , order the bean full body ( i just did )
0	not amazon 's fault , but everlast 's . even the box promises 2 10-pound weights , but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights . this is not a bargain , but fairly expensive . quality is just ok. not flimsy or dangerous , but not what i wanted , either
0	my first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking . then i tried to use it . i mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer . in the first day of use i just ran out of patience and plan to return it . here 's the problems i had with the altitech2 1 . most of the time the buttons work fine , but several times i pressed the mode button and the mode did not change . 2 . when setting declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press set/reset/light to reverse the digits , but as soon as you press the set/reset/light button the unit ends the calibration mode . 3 . the temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase . finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees . i held the unit in front of the ac vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees , i suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees . the temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees . 4 . i constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber . the digital thermometer registered 78 degrees , the altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees . i blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer . the digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and i turned the heat off . the altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees . after removing from the chamber the altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees , went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes . despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees . 5 . the compass will only stay on for 10 seconds , then the display turns off to conserve battery . this never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map . when the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display . since this button is recessed , you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail ( i had to ) . this moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button . i 'll stick with my 19th century compass for now . this unit might be worth keeping for me if the altimeter is reliable , but after all the other trouble i had i did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as i had lost confidence in the device .
1	this is a great starter board for the price . my son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable . seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack . it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried . i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books . a little more padding in the straps ( or smaller textbooks ) would make it perfect , but it is still better than anything i have seen out there . i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student
1	this watch/heart rate monitor is everything i wanted . i can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face , i havent used the other features yet , but appreciate not wearing a strap hrm anymore
1	this is a great cot . it is low profile , and made of strong materials . i was worried about the wire legs , but they are very , very strong . so strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame . this might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms . it folds up easy and is very portable . also , i have a smaller frame , and although this cot is perfect for me , a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area . you wo n't be disappointed in this one for the money
1	this thing is great - my wife put it together in half an hour and she 's an idiot . nonetheless it is very solid . as a long time alcoholic i have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store , etc . because this thing is low i can have the tv on , a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while i pedal ! i did 1 mile the first day at medium drag ( despite what other reviewers have said there is a huge difference in drag between settings ) , 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now - now i can drive my car to the store because my legs work again - this thing is really good . plus it 's silent - dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a bic lighter . but it is made in china ... note : shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days
0	we bought this for our 2 year old daughter . it was a nightmare to put together , then it did not fit . becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes . we bought a 20inch frame , men 's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting . not worth it ! !
1	mfg by northpole ltd , this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort . seating position is leaned back , lacking adjustment for more upright seating . fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon . the arms are padded with foam , and i question foam durability over the long haul . the chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder . chair is rated at 225 pounds , and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag . nfl team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp . team name and logo is also printed on carry bag . overall , a comfortable , well constructed chair ( with exceptions as noted ) with an eye catching logo of your favorite team
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments . yes , the bag is n't huge , but it certainly gets the job done . it 's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks , but it 's a bag that has style . that 's why i got it . it 's a bit more european in its design , and is of good quality . i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon . look to be good quality . also , at this price -- it is such a good deal
1	i never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful . now we have this light my fire spork , and i have to wonder why nobody thought of this before ! nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably mre 's too . if you 've a friend or relative `` over there '' , send 'em one
0	i ordered it for christmas but i did n't get it until december 27th . it 's now in a closet waiting for another gift-giving occassion
0	if you search for the keyword 'illuminator led flashlight ' , you 'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices . so naturally , you should just go for the lowest price , right ? not so fast ... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere ( see my `` customer images ' above ) , and was going to order a few more as gifts . the lowest price i found here is from 'iggfactory handhelditems ' at $ 7.95 . but during checkout , i found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $ 8.21 for just one item . the flashlight itself weights only 7 oz. , but the company charges 4 lb . for shipping weight . what a rip-off ! with such inflated shipping cost , you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores ( such as walgreen ) for $ 15 . at least there you can return the item easily if you 're not happy with it . [ update on jan 21 , 2007 ] : please check out my review for the garrity power lite , where i have made a comparison betweeen it and the illuminator . it is my opinion that the garrity is a better flashlight .
0	i purchased a new 26 '' men 's huffy cranbrook cruiser bike . after assembly , to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube . so what do you do , disassemble and return ? no , call huffy and they take you through nine hoops . finally they sent me the right part which took ten days , and i took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me $ 15 labor to fix the rear wheel . no savings ! p.s . the bike is a piece of junk made in china . the instruction manual is nearly useless
